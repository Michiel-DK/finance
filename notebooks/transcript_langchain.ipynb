At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you, that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around any macroeconomic deceleration, potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in various regions where we operate, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend in our platform, are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the Risk Factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. Lastly, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Analyst Day on Tuesday, October 4, 2022 in New York City. This event will be webcast and available on our Investor Relations website. I’ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you’ve seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share, despite some macroeconomic uncertainty. In the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, the Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and Connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we sign new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven’t spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I’d like to today, because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment. Joint business plans, or JBPs, our long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multi-year period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnerships and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world’s largest automakers and technology companies along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs. Many people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and wind share regardless of the economic environment. I’d like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back. First, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that’s the worldwide shift to advertising fueled connected television. I don’t know that we’ve ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic. The second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google’s ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last two decades, when dollars move over from offline spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment, that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google’s advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world. CTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though, because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or double click, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive, because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound coupled with these competitive market dynamics for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV. CTV is fast becoming a must buy. And in some cases, the highest stack rank part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content. And lastly, I’d like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we’re doing and how we’re taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple years. We’ve seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the states attorneys general concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google’s ads business, but it’s not just here in the United States, it’s also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the UK’s competitive market authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the UK. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, we’re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising costs for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google’s biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity. By contrast, we don’t own any inventory and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can’t overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising. Especially, the large brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I’m confident we will do well, regardless of Google’s moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand side platform or DSP. In addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I am often asked to speak about the open internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet. I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I’m concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google’s behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that’s for another day, I believe so long as we execute The Trade Desk is going to do well, regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly, as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we’re so optimistic about our future. So with that, let’s shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics, and how we’re executing. So let’s discuss what’s happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we’re very clear on our mission and we’re extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side and our goals are clear to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain. It’s because of these factors that more and more of the world’s leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It’s also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it’s Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated or Amazon’s AWS ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2. The same with Experian who’s using UID2 as a common currency, where Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brands, selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this. I also want to talk about Netflix recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models, similar to how they led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We’ve had many constructive conversation with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising. The Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet, the fact that Netflix didn’t choose Google is very telling. We believe it’s another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest. Xandr is a strong sell side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they’ve done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable demand side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher in this case Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy. Disney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad supported option. The economics of the market demanded. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them. For example, one of our early CTV partners NBC continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery+ and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world’s leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising. And CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It’s where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It’s where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged in user base is where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. There is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They’ve spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized, experience across all of their channels, but as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumer’s privacy is highly protected. As you’ve seen Disney recently announced and expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their audience graph, which is now interoperable with UID2. Aaron LaBerge the President and CTO of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, perhaps set at best and I quote. The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buy net scale, and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney. I want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you’ve been paying attention to anything we’ve said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you’ll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I’ve said, I’m not sure it is ever in Google’s best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn’t really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google’s decision making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies that doesn’t really capture the scope of what’s going on. And Disney is a great example of this. Disney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It’s much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner. Part of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here, is because we’ve already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that’s something of this central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform. And AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian marketing services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets. As we’ve said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bills. First and foremost, it’s about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry. And with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need pure more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that’s why I’m confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said, at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Of course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty, but even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009, while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gain share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it’s because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar, that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decision advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there’s no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk. Throughout the first half of 2022, and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part that’s because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing, advertising that delivers the highest return and CTV has moved up the priority list. So, while we can’t control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We will never rest on our laurels, as one of the few high growth tech companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company’s history. A year later, a 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform. With all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet. Within Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and Target and we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it’s the data infrastructure work that’s already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EUID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction. We continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We’re working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year’s upfront and early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory. As I said, at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead. And with that, I’ll pass the baton to Blake, who’ll give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top-line growth of 35% is especially impressive, given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spent, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of. During the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We’ve successfully completed a full transition to Solimar and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression. We are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although, it is still very early days for us spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well. With the continued strong top-line performance in Q2, we generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again, in Q2. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live companywide event and over three years, resumed and travel also continued to ramp up. From a channel perspective, CTV via a wide margin, let our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV represented a low-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, and display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency, as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represents at least 1% of our spend, fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year, but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, CTV spend in Europe, again more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investment so will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data driven with their ad spend much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend nearly all of them groom the double digits during the quarter, both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average however, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally automotive still grew the double-digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses, Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $250 million up 45% year-over-year. Growth and operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development. As we continue to build the platform for long-term growth, as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock based awards, the timing of which are variable. Adjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days up nine days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days up six days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3. While there’s continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question is coming from Shyam Patil from Susque. Your line is live.\\nShyam Patil: Hey guys, congrats on the results and the outlook. Jeff, I wanted to ask, this is now the second quarter in a row where your results and outlook are significantly better than, what we’re seeing from other app supported companies, especially in the face of a slowing macro. And I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, what you think is driving that outperformance? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Well, so first let me just say, I’m incredibly proud of our Q3, r the start to our Q3 and especially our performance in Q2. But let me just highlight just a couple of the things that have really gone our way in Q2 and given us so much momentum going into Q4 or going into Q3 and Q4. First, we have an amazing secular tailwind of CTV, arguably the best secular tailwind we’ve ever had. Second, we are of course, seeing the benefits of Solimar, which we’ve gone to a 100% and it just has all these benefits to our clients. Third, we’ve got this, this momentum around the joint business plans where we’re just getting closer to brands and we’re creating better partnerships with each of them. And one of the things that they’re excited about is just our relationships in shopper marketing, the overall call, we started with the very biggest retailer in the world in Walmart and we just continued to expand on that. We highlighted some of those included Albertsons during the prepared remarks. But I do want to emphasize that we have never claimed to be a bellwether of the economy or of advertising yet. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of times people look at our performance and say, how is this so different than everybody else’s? And what is often happening is, we are winning because of those secular tailwinds and because programmatic is growing share and because digital is growing share and meanwhile it is possible to have some macroeconomic headwinds in our face and have a secular tailwind of CTV and all the things I just talked about that, that overshadow that. And I think what we are seeing right now is just an amazing trend, which is that, that CTV in particular is extremely competitive. It’s also extremely effective. And so, as people are looking for alternatives to walled gardens they are looking to companies like us, who can give them objectivity to buy across all these fragmented places. Many of the smaller walled gardens, I think are especially under pressure. And as I’ve said, I think CTV can be the thing that brings down the walled gardens. But that’ll start with those that are smallest. So, I think often, we’re being compared to walled gardens of various sizes, and I don’t necessarily think that the fair comparison, and of course, I think we’re also in anomaly from the macro. So, hopefully that par is out all those things, but I’m really proud of what we did in Q2 and really optimistic about our Q3.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Shyam.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov [Cannonball]. Your line is live.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Just to follow up maybe on this, on the first question, can you, Jeff, please talk about what’s going on in Connected TV. I’m sure, that some Connected TV players reported fairly slow growth in Q2 and guided to continued slow growth in the remainder of the year. So and if I listen to your remarks and assuming that your Connected TV spend is growing at least double your overall spend, that would imply at least 50% growth. So can you explain to us, how to understand that what the diversification is about and does the quick follow up there, maybe you can tell us about how you use the terms scatter market and spot market in Connected TV that sort of became a thing this earning season?\\nJeff Green: Yes, no problem first. And thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, CTV is a secular tailwind that it continues to help drive our business. I would even say it continues to lead our business, including our growth. The scale that we’re seeing is amazing. And the changes in the world, including the pandemic, which made everybody stay home and stream a lot more, have created changes to the ecosystem that I don’t think anybody predicted. And, if you just take a step back and you think about if five years ago, you would’ve thought that HBO and Netflix would be showing ads I think a lot of people were public about saying that isn’t going to happen and it’s happening now, so there are these tailwinds that I just can’t overstate. And that as a result, CTV is often becoming the place where the very first dollar it is spent. But one of the things, I really like about your question and it gives me a platform to talk about is, okay, well then why isn’t everyone in CTV seeing the same sort of growth that you are seeing? And there are a couple reasons for that one. There are some companies that are deployed the walled garden strategy, which is that I have something special either on my operating system or on my channel, and you should buy that exclusively through me. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no one in CTV has a position that is strong enough to be draconian the same way that you can in other parts of digital like search or social or some of those others. So as a result those tactics, I think are proving more difficult as more and more choices are coming online. So a platform that sits objectively and helps people choose across the 20, 30, 40 places where you can buy, I mean, think of your own habits as a consumer, you were probably watching CTV on two or three apps five years ago. Now you’re probably watching them on seven, eight, nine, 10 plus that fragmentation creates a greater need for somebody to centrally partner with all of them measure, reach, and frequency and performance across all of them, and has to have a business model that is eligible to partner with everybody. So that’s why I would argue that we have outperformed everybody else is that unique position and that unique strategy that we’ve deployed as it relates to scatter versus spot and there, I know in this earning season, there has been some discussion about scatter, let me just break it down really simply, scatter is a reference to linear or traditional television where you buy things in upfront, those things that either don’t work out as planned or need to be adjusted to you create this middle market, where you’re buying traditional television with traditional budgets in not very sophisticated, quickly adapt market. Separately from that is a spot market. And what I would call the spot market is the programmatic market that we operate in. And so when people talk about scatter and spot, especially because when they’re talking to people in the financial industry, they can draw analogies to equities. That don’t seem that different, but really what we’re talking about in television one is very closely associated with the upfront market, which was invented in the 60s. The other one we’re talking about digital that brings all of the data and decisioning to bear that, that the internet can really offer that is what makes it so television is going to get better and better, which is there are going to be fewer ads. They are going to be more relevant. There are going to be highly effective. And that funds content at a rate that has never been seen before, that can only be done by a spot market and a forward market, not a legacy upfront market and scatter market. So those are the reasons, why there’s a big difference in rhetoric around scatter versus spot. The spot market is amazingly strong, the strongest it has ever been. And that’s because of the variety of apps that are coming into the ecosystem and the need for ad funded content because all of them need ad dollars in order to continue to fund their content making machines.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Vasily.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is live.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, could you just spend a little more talking about – a little more time talking about what the Disney partnership means for your business? How much access does this deal give you to Disney’s premium CTV inventory and to what magnitude does it grow your footprint for UID? That’s my first question. And my second is for Blake just around hiring plans. We’ve definitely heard a lot of companies in the ad industry pulling back on hiring. So just would love to hear where you guys sit on hiring plans for 2022. Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Awesome. Thanks. I’ll go first and I’ll let Blake go and just to order you asked the question. So let me first just reiterate our strategy in UID2. So first, we created UID2. We open sourced it, we gave it to the ecosystem. This is not ours, but it is something that we really want to see successful because we think there needs to be a privacy safe currency that makes it possible for personalization to take place at large scale. That needs to replace cookies, but it also needs to do way more than that. And when people reduce it down to a discussion about replacing cookies, it doesn’t really capture what it’s about. It is a currency of the Internet that makes personalization and privacy control way better than it exists today. The way that you win that way, the way that you fix the infrastructure of the Internet, which can be massively upgraded, especially so that consumers have more control over privacy is that you partner with the infrastructure. Many might mistakenly think the way that you change the infrastructure of the Internet as you partner with millions of publishers or millions of apps or hundreds of content creators in television. And instead, it’s to start with the infrastructure. So the deal with Disney wouldn’t have easily been done if we hadn’t already partnered with Salesforce or Snowflake or a Adobe or AWS, some of those infrastructure plays that make it possible. But because we had it made it easy for us to then have great conversations with Disney. Additionally, Disney has done an amazing job of assembling all of its different assets, including Hulu, which was one of the first Connected TV plays to really understand the benefit of highly relevant ads and high CPMs that come from relevance. And that you of course have to have a strategy around identity and personalization in order to get those high CPMs and in order to get that benefit. So I think one of the things that Disney has really led the way on is making certain that all the way at the top of their technical organization, they have a clear understanding of what it takes to provide personalization and consumer privacy protection and control at the same time. And while doing that, I think that they have made it possible to better monetize Hulu, ESPN, ABC, Disney+, FX, and so many other things that they own. Because they own so many of those and because I think they understand that relationship at the highest levels of the organization, I think this partnership is really significant, because number one, I think Disney has a clear strategy going forward that some others don’t. And two, I think we’ve established ourselves as a great partner of theirs, and we continue to provide them with an amazing amount of demand and high CPMs that is going to fuel their business and better content. Because they represent such a significant amount of the inventory, and especially because almost everything in CTV is logged in, this represents a massive step forward for UID for an authenticated Internet for a better internet. And when you look at extended runway for cookies going away, as well as just the need for CTV to get a better at monetizing. This represents a move forward for everyone. So I do think Disney is proving itself to be a leader once again. So it’s hard to overstate the significance of the partnership. Blake?\\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. James, regarding your question on the hiring, I just would take just a real quick moment to step back a little bit. If we think about where we are in our business, we have – we’re in one of the greatest situations I think a company could ask for, right. We’ve got high top line growth, high EBITDA growth with strong margins and we also generate solid consistent annual free cash flow. And so having those three things operating together for me, it’s got super special meaning as you can imagine. And what it does is it gives us the opportunity and the ability to be deliberate with our choices. And in doing so, I’m also proud of our ability to stay disciplined with those investments, regardless of the operating environment that we’re in. You mentioned what other companies are doing. And based on what we’re hearing, well, there are many of our peers that might have more resources, that are pausing, hiring or cutting investments because they invested too aggressively. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple years like I – it sounds like many companies did. And I think that’s really paid off for us. It’s given us the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and including hiring, which is one of the largest ones that we will entertain. And so like we mentioned earlier this year, we expect to increase the pace of our investments as we focus on the long-term growth of the business, but we’re always going to stay mindful of long-term productivity supported by our business model. So with regards to hiring and how it affects expenses and such, our Q2 EBITDA was super strong and that included our first full company in-person event that we had in over three years. Our Q3 forecast reflects that investment thesis that we can continue to generate strong EBITDA and invest for the long-term. And we’re focused in hiring in areas that fuel our growth, whether that’s engineering or business development or account management roles. And so I’m comfortable with the trajectory that we’re on and where things stand. And I really think that we can pursue those investments in an operating expense structure that we believe is actually better than pre-pandemic. So I really like the position we’re in to drive more efficiency, more EBITDA and free cash flow, but also as we scale. And so I’m really excited about our situation there.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, James.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. And obviously congrats on a really strong performance all things considered. Jeff with the – with Netflix going with Microsoft and Xandr being SSP, but also DSP itself. What does that mean for the Trade Desk opportunity with Netflix over time? And as there is going to be a great deal of inventory coming into the CTV market from Netflix, and I guess others just, could that be a depressing factor for pricing for Connected TV in the short and medium-term? Then Blake, maybe just a quick one with Solimar’s adoption at now a 100%. I think that’s what you said in the prepared remarks. Anyway to help quantify the contribution of that software upgrade to the outperformance this quarter. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Youssef for the question. I actually was hoping somebody would ask about Netflix and Microsoft, because I think it’s one of the most exciting scenes that’s happened in our space in it in the quarter. So let me first just restate something that, that Netflix stated on their earnings call, which I think is a direct quote, it’s still early days. So Netflix has been like learning about the advertising business or in the advertising business for only a few months as they’re – have established a very important, but early partnership. But I – for one was very excited when I learned that they had selected Microsoft for a number of reasons, as many of you know, I worked at Microsoft before I sold the first ad exchange to Microsoft. I in fact introduced the President of the ads division to – at the time, the CEO of AppNexus, which later became Xandr. So it’s been a part of my personal journey, as well as the fact that I’ve just been very close to AppNexus and Xandr, of course, Xandr now being owned by Microsoft. Xandr, as you point out Youssef, it has a small DSP, but it is primarily an SSP. They primarily focus on the sell side. If you look at the – if you were to stack rank the major players of demand for CTV, I think you’d find that we are the largest and somewhere around number 10 near the bottom of the top 10 list would be Xandr in terms of size. I would estimate that they provide less than 10% of the demand to other independent inventory or content companies. So as a result, what I think that means for us and for the open Internet is that the role that Microsoft is going to play for Netflix is one where they are helping them get started. They’re helping them create a clear identity strategy. I think they very clearly are going to have to have a strategy both for identity, as well as for monetization that involves the open Internet. Because this is early days, it’s less important to me about the role the Trade Desk plays with Netflix in the crawl phase than it does in the walk and the run phase. And to me, selecting Microsoft makes it, so it’s nearly inevitable that Netflix will be a part of the open Internet and that they’ll welcome demand from lots of different places. And that will be the only way that they can maximize their inventory and get the highest CPMs possible, as somebody who wants to see Netflix do well and has a strong relationship with Netflix leadership. I think this is a solid plan. It’s a great start. There’s a lot of work ahead of them, but I think that we are extremely likely to have a great partnership with them over the long-term, but there’s a lot of stuff that has to be done in order for Netflix to be the leader in AVOD that they’ve been in SVOD. So – but I’m looking forward to it.\\nBlake Grayson: And then with regards to your question on Solimar is a high. I’m really excited about the traction that we’ve seen that I think the product really separates us from the competition and we did reach a 100% usage. I think that it took us about a year to get there. I think the last major product update check like 50% longer in the amount of time it took. So it’s a real Testament to the team and the value that I think we’re providing the customers that are doing that upgrade. And so on a usage basis, the trends look good like average data elements used per impression, it’s more than doubled for the same customers on our previous platform. Average channel usage has increased over 50%. And then the AI, machine learning element that we have the adoption on that on Solimar, I think it increased around 50% versus the prior platform. And this is all about getting customers a better ROI. If we can do that, they’re going to return again for future campaigns and we think it – what that does is it spins the flywheel for everybody for us included. And so just really excited about the momentum here and really proud actually what the team was able to deliver.\\nYoussef Squali: Thank you, both.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef.\\nOperator: Okay. Up next we have Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is live.\\nTim Nollen: I peak my interest, especially about the spot market response a few questions ago being a forward market and how it’s different from scatter. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks about a forward market product. I wonder if you could help maybe explain a bit more, what that is. Is this something that sets you up for more of a upfront participation for CTV guaranteed deals next year or maybe just a bit more color on what that is. And then I’m assuming Unified ID 2.0 will factor in to all of this. And you said you’re optimistic about this becoming kind of a transaction standard for this year. Would UID2 be playing a more prominent role in measurement or attribution of CTV ads going forward?\\nJeff Green: Thanks for the questions, Tim. So maybe aside from CTV, my favorite topic to talk about is actually forward market. And I especially love to talk about it in the context of investors, just because you live the concept every single day, even though, it’s somewhat more into advertising. So first of all, the upfront this process where you commit to buy ads on television was a process that was created in the early 60s. In fact, we’ve sort of jokingly made comparison, maybe half jokingly made comparison to the fact that the audio cassette was invented the same year that the TV upfronts were and audio cassettes obviously have evolved, we don’t use them anymore in our daily lives, but the upfront hasn’t changed much and the process is exactly the same. You have a party or an event, where you commit dollars to advertising for the better part of the year with the absence of data and transactions like it’s just – in a way it’s even strange that as an industry it’s still happens that way. I mean, if we had a forward market for tulips, that was exactly the same as it was 400 years ago. We would look for ways to evolve. We would do something different. So the forward market that we’re developing with our partners is much more like a commodities market, where you have forward contracts, you use data and forecasting to get the benefits of commitment. And the thing that is really amazing about TV ads in particular is that publishers are willing to take less money if you’ll commit to buy it in advance. And advertisers are willing to pay more money, if they can have the assurance that they’re going to get it. I mean, imagine, you wouldn’t spend $3 million, $4 million or $5 million to make a Super Bowl ad, if you didn’t know it was going to run during the Super Bowl. So commitments can be a really important part of television. And so as we move to CTVs, there’s no reason to create a rudimentary 1960s version of a forward market. We should create one that leverages all the very best parts of programmatic takes all the learnings of commodities markets and utilizes that very – the very best things about programmatic. So we’ve developed that its early days, but we have a good commitment from both buyers and sellers to make it possible to create a much better and stronger market. The only way that that works is if you have good forecasting and the only way that that works is if you have a common currency like UID2. So two – the second part of your question, does UID2 play a significant role in that? Absolutely. Because in order for us to give a common understanding to buyers to sellers, it’s one thing to buy in the spot market where you’re buying an ad for less than a penny in almost every case. It’s another thing to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in advance to buying ads. You need a greater degree of assurance. You need greater transparency. You need visibility that can only come from forecasts where you have a common understanding, common currencies become very important in order to have any market other than a spot market, unless you’re operating in discounts and constantly working on make goods, which is exactly what the upfront and scatter markets do in traditional television. Thanks, Tim.\\nOperator: Okay. Next we have Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try two, please. So, Jeff for the business, there have always been several growth factors or growth vectors from international to shopper marketing to CTV to Solimar to UID2. Now with Solimar fully integrated and CTV clearly driving growth. How about the other three, the UID2, international and shopper marketing? Does the extension of cookies – cookie deprecation change your focus or investment towards UID2? And then how are you thinking about international and shopper marketing in general over the next six to, call it, 18 months. And then a question for Blake, is possible to get the magnitude of contribution from retail or Walmart and other partnerships, as well as political spend for the third quarter. That’s baked in your guide. Thank you very much.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I’m glad you’ve asked about just these other growth drivers and of course, how does UID affect it and especially just how does the deprecation of cookies affect UID and international expansion and shopper marketing? So I’m not certain that we made this as clear as we could’ve in the prepared remarks. Cookies and ads that are bought inside a browser, because cookies are only relevant inside of a browser at least directly relevant inside of a browser, represents a small percentage of our business. Display is a small percentage of our business. It’s – as a percentage, it’s shrinking, even though, we’ve seen growth, because growth in other areas are growing faster. It’s still continues to shrink. So it’s a small slice of the pie. What are much bigger are things like mobile, which don’t rely on cookies or CTV, which don’t rely on cookies. They have other ways of creating identity. That, of course, in CTV, nearly everything you do is on the other side of a login, meaning you log into Netflix or you log to Amazon or you log into Peacock or Paramount or Hulu before you view content. And that makes it very prone to be interoperable with something like UID2. So there’s no cookie problem to solve in TV, but everybody in TV needs more subscribers, and I believe everybody in TV needs to offer an AVOD solution for those subscribers that would rather pay with their time than with money. And especially when you have to keep providing or making rate hikes in order to pay for incremental content. So the cookie changes don’t slow down UID at all. And in fact, I’ve always said that the biggest threat to the walled gardens is the competitive nature of Connected Television. That’s especially true in identity and the competitive nature of television is really what I think will fuel UID forward faster than anything that happens with cookies delay or not. But the same thing is true internationally. I mean, especially if you look at the places where GDP growth is predicted to be the highest in the world, those are places that are often mobile first, so they’re less reliant on cookies as well, so especially in Asia. So business models that have a holistic approach to identity and can customize ads to think holistically are the ones that are going to do the best, especially for the biggest companies in the world, which is why I think we’re really in a strong position for international growth. And thirdly, as it relates to international, I think it’s fair to say, there’s more likely to be economic headwinds outside the United States than inside the United States. It given that we look at this as land grab time. So there is a big opportunity for us to expand our market share. Even if there are economic headwinds internationally, that we just want to continue to invest in, especially because outside of big competitors like the Google’s of the world where their DSP is not their primary focus for those smaller competitors where being a DSP is their primary focus. They’re often much smaller and can’t afford to make those investments. So there’s a big opportunity for us to expand around the world. And then in shopper marketing, it – there is this incredible desire, especially inside of CPGs, and CPGs for a whole bunch of reasons, including inflation are under pressure to do more with less. And what can really help them is to see end-to-end. If I show an ad to this person, how did it affect whether they buy it, add a store to see end-to-end, the impact of their spend is extremely valuable to them. And retailers know that that is a way for them to spin their flywheels faster. Initially they looked at it as a way to make more money on selling data, but now they look at it as a way to spin their flywheels faster. And so I think it’s one of the surest ways that we will spin our own flywheel is to continue to enable an open internet where there’s lots of competition and where marketers that sell goods inside of stores, brick-and-mortar stores continue to get the data driven benefits that historically have been reserved for online retailers like Amazon. So, where everybody is looking at competing with Amazon, they know they have to be focused on becoming as data driven or more than they are. And we’re just seeing amazing strides in retail that, that contributes to our shopper marketing strategy. So, we’ve just seen our TAM expand in the short term, just because of this focus of moving to fixing this sort of end-to-end challenge. And I do think it is true that the discussion about the demise of cookies has made that faster, even though it’s a totally different aspect of measurement, but it is improved and accelerated the move to better measurement, which I don’t know that there’s any place that’s better off in those places where we’re doing end-to-end measurement and shopper marketing,\\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up sort to on your other questions, I think, on the shopper marketing component, we don’t break out that level of detail in our shopper marketing business. The only thing I could just say is that, we are seeing the spend ramp, it ramped into Q2 is more large brands, test our testing and adopting it and we expect that to continue. I think just the selection opportunity that our customers are going, are now having is going to be a flywheel spin for them that I debate in my head, whether they’re going to be able to get it very many other places, if any. And so I think that’s just such a long-term opportunity for us like Jeff said, I’m just; I’m super excited about it. And then with regards to your question on political, in the midterms, the spend will occur much closer to Election Day than we might find in a presidential year, like we expect to see that start ramping here over the late summer. I would say through November, there’s so many races out there that are going to be competitive, and we’ll just have to see how competitive, whether it’s the House the Senate, governor campaigns or whatnot. I think that our overall expectation, and is that the in Q3, we expected to be a low single-digit percentage spend in Q3. And that was in our prepared remarks as well. But overall just with regards to political, what I would say is, our goal is to it’s to run a better process, it’s to earn trust with our customers. We’ve been building this business over quite a few years. We’ve got really high retention rates with our customers. We do believe, we’re the go to platform for digital advertising now versus maybe other social media platforms. And so we do expect some tailwinds. That’s why we called it out in the guidance, but we’ll have to see how this all unfolds into the back half of the year.\\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks.\\nJeff Green: And then John, we can squeeze in one more.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys for squeezing me in this. Just as a quick follow up to the forwarded market concept. We wanted to ask about refundability or resalability of inventory, if you will. If an advertiser takes delivery, for example, finds out that an impression or a consumer is already a customer Jeff, are you envisioning that advertisers would’ve the ability to resale inventory and any thoughts on the dynamics there in terms of market liquidity, and participation, and really potential financialization of the market? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I think at initially what you’re going to want to see is control from both publishers or content owners and advertisers in terms of who shows up? Who has access to it? But I do think that in the long term, and we’re talking years from now, one way that you can get buyers to sign up is if they buy too much, they can sell it to somebody else. And so I do think it’s possible to see a derivatives market exist sort of on top of that forward market, so that you can essentially transact in the rights to buy those so that you can secure inventory. But making them fungible makes it, or resellable, or both rather, as I think a really important part of the market in the long term. So, I do think that that component will exist in the long-term, but the most important thing in the short term is to take advantage of the fact that you can bring data to bear that publishers want guarantees and all the benefits of programmatic advertisers would like to reserve inventory and have all the benefits of programmatic, which includes the ability for them to bring their data into the equation. In traditional television, as well as in the scatter market, advertisers can’t really bring their own data to the table. So, the forward market would enable them to do that, which would help prices go up and is really going to benefit, both the buyer and the seller. I think there’s going to be a lot of rules that exist for years to prevent the resale of that. But I do think long-term the economic incentives are there for that to exist. It creates an amazing market. And I don’t think that there’s any company that’s better positioned to benefit from this market than The Trade Desk, because of the role that we play by looking at everything by looking at nearly all inventory, because we don’t own it. We make it possible to partner with all of it. And I think we can easily become once again, the world leader in providing demand, not just in the spot market, which we already are today, but also in the forward market, which is why we’re working so hard to create it, and leverage the relationships that we’ve been tending to for more than a decade now.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Brian.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.',\n",
       "   \"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth : Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.  In particular, our expectations around the impact of the recent pandemic on our business and results of operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions or other macro events that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to our risk factors referenced in our press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green : Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future. Our performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment. We now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives such as Connected TV, Shopper Data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us. As a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Group's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic in part because of the combination of our exceptional 95% plus retention rate and our significant growth rate. There are macroeconomic forces, which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also gives me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show out. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV. In fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lot of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient. So first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean we've used cookies as a make-shift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique community to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. The open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers. With this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers. UID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each Web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress. In terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it. Let me give you one quick example, which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like the Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a comScore top 5 lifestyle media platform with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.  MediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now. Momentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages, simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will [crater]. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2 with many already reporting strong CPM growth. The ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2. AppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet. We also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for Web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium. In the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today. In order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt. The CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still an opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability while significantly upgrading consumer privacy. And new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content.  Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments like CTV we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy. So in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement, partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants. There is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I'd like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it. Already, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair-step increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future. Related to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I'd like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies. I do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return. For example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters, the Washington Post, Gannett, Conde Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others, McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hearst Magazines and Newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle, the Tribune Group and several others. In the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including the L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet. As more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers. For those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment. Let me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers. On a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDB TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by Discovery Plus leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic. A tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted in mass to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them. For consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera.  In the past, nearly all channels have had ads. Now once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely set up a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further. It's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression. In all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day. HBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs. For CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience. CTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models like upfronts and even programmatic guarantees where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets. As advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers. With the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video in all of its forms has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content. We work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it. And we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply. Not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets. Premium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV. And so you'd think they'd be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content. It's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. An advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies. The Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data. As the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward. As I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers. Our profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 started out strong with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. Solimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster. We are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up. With the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend, and audio represented about 5% of spend. Geographically, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1. We did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and food and drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1, and free cash flow was $136 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. I am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business with significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment. I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Shyam Patil from SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the results. I had a couple of questions. First one, Jeff, when we look at your results and your outlook, they look a lot better than what we’ve seen from a lot of other ad-funded companies during earnings. Can you just talk about what you think is driving your outperformance? And then second question, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rest of the year shaping up?\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Shyam. Appreciate it. So I – as I look at the outperformance for this quarter, and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter, it’s hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I don’t know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course, we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. It’s just a very exciting phenomenon. But I’m also just very encouraged by the fact that, of course, there’s macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course, the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment, what we’ve historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where they’re going to spend money, and they become very data-driven in the choices that they’re making. And in our case, that means they’re spending more with us. So I’m just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're –we’ve seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year, which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising, especially from the global players of CTV, I think it really sets up the second half of the year for – around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think we’re seeing even more of now. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year, we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP who’s just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Target’s media company, Roundel. So to have Walgreens, Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement, just unbelievable. But just again, nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then, of course, in the second half of the year, we’re also going to have a midterm election. From recent events, that seems to be one that’s going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think it’s – we’re very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So we’ll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words, we’ll move everything over to Solimar, the platform that we shipped on July 7, 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for, but now we’re extremely confident that we’ll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath, but we didn’t mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed, L.A. Times, Forbes, MediaVine, Red Ventures, which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others, have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second – or to the remainder of the year, say, second half, but to the remainder of the year.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Two, if I can. Jeff, 3 to 4 years ago, you were already on the strong opinion or the strong belief that Netflix has to offer an ad-supported model. That was just a matter of time. How do you feel about your chances of potentially partnering with Netflix around that opportunity and – or the potential risk of Netflix potentially building its own DSP, Amazon? And Blake, Q2 EBITDA implies a pretty big sequential and year-on-year drop, I think, to that 33%. Can you maybe just flesh out the biggest areas of investments and whether there is a typical kind of conservative built into that or – and just how should we think about that for the remainder of the year?\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. Great. So you’re right, I’ve been saying for more than half a decade that I believe that Netflix will eventually have to show ads. And that’s really based on the fact that I believe that consumers want choice. And that while Netflix has done a phenomenal job of preserving an amazing experience for consumers that at some point, that becomes cost prohibitive because you have to just keep raising prices, that is exactly what’s happened over the years. And they’re now at a place where I believe they will benefit from offering that choice. I think they have more pressure on them. Because of that history, I believe they have more pressure on them to create an amazing ad experience than anybody in the streaming competition, if you will. It’s partly because of that, that – you may know, David Wells, who was the previous CFO of Netflix joined our Board almost 5 years ago. So we’ve had a great relationship with Netflix because of him, and I’m extremely optimistic in the potential for us to partner with Netflix. One thing that you should know – and Youssef, you – I think you put just words to something I’ve heard from a few other people as well is why wouldn’t Netflix build this themselves? So what most advertisers are trying to do, they are trying to manage what we call reach and frequency. Like how often do I show the same ad to the same consumer across apps and channels? And so if I just control how many times I show an ad on station 112 and then just control how they can they show an ad separately on station 114, and those 2 things don’t talk to each other at all, you can waste a lot of money and show a lot of repetitive apps. This is why in traditional television, there’s a lot of repetition. It’s also why the ad break has so many ad in that. If Netflix were to provide an ad experience that have lots of repetition, in order for them to make the money that they need, they would have to show lots of them because the CPMs will be lower because they’re less effective, which creates more repetition, and you get into that unfortunate cycle that I believe has happened in traditional television. The sure is way out of that is for them to partner with an objective independent DSP that manages reach and frequency and budgeting across all the fragmented pieces of streaming so that we can provide the very best ad experience for everybody because we’ll be paying the highest prices, because of the fact that it’s so much more efficient or effective. So I’m very optimistic that we’ll be able to create partnership with every major streaming company in the world, including Netflix. The fact that we have a phenomenal relationship with Discovery, and therefore, also Time Warner and HBO, we have great relationship with them. We have a fantastic relationship with Disney. We partnered for years with Peacock and with Paramount and so many others. Of course, I had the expectation that we’ll do the same thing with Netflix.\\nBlake Grayson: And Youssef, to follow up on your question on the EBITDA for Q2. Just to frame it up, I’m really happy with our situation and where we are. Like we mentioned on last quarter’s call, we do expect in 2022 to increase the pace of our investment as we focus on the long-term growth of our business. And that’s got a support from a very strong business model that produces strong free cash flow and has a really, really solid balance sheet. Our Q2 forecast reflects that. It includes accelerating hiring across the business, particularly in engineering, business development and account management roles that really play a huge factor in driving our long-term growth. We also expect our in-office expenses to start ramping this year to prepandemic levels. And we also anticipate hosting more employee events to get the team together. But in terms of this year, Q1 EBITDA was very strong. I’m comfortable with our EBITDA trajectory and where things stand over the remainder of the year. And like we said last quarter, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic. And as I’ve always said, this business is really built for and I’m really optimistic about driving meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow as we scale. So I think that lots of great opportunities in front of us, and I feel pretty good about it.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Swanson from RBC Capital.\\nMatt Swanson: I’ll add my congratulations on the quarter. Jeff, maybe staying on the theme of CTV and Netflix. You mentioned still having an abundance or maybe an overabundance of demand for CTV. Well, with the upfront is coming up, could you maybe give us an updated view on the supply-demand curve, especially for premium CTV content? And how you think about the addition of Netflix and Disney+ with all that content coming online and whether or not we’ll see lower CPMs? And then I guess as was kind of a follow-up. Jeff, you mentioned that obviously, you saw Netflix coming from a long term – a long time away. When we think about the maturity curve now, though, for any subscription model hitting that threshold of payers, do you think this is going to change how new products launch from here on out when they see a Disney and Netflix and HBO Max all leading ads? Is – are we going to see any subscription-only products still get launched?\\nJeff Green: First of all, I appreciate the congratulations. We’re extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction, most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first, let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And it’s in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and you’re paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result, when you’re adding new inventory, it’s desperately needed. There’s demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what I’anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that they’re, of course, in order to continue subscribers, which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers, which is the way they’re all graded, they have to have a great ad experience. They can’t alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance, and they have to provide very few ads. So that means we’re going to see scarcity for a while, for as far as we can see in the future, honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious – as obvious to everyone, so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that we’re just SVOD, I don’t think it’s strategically smart for anybody who’s just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. It’s like any product where over time as it evolves, if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesn’t have features that rivals the iPhone 13, and instead, it rivals the features of iPhone 1, you’re just not going to be competitive. You’ve got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that, that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: I have a couple, if I may. One on Europe. You said in the prepared remarks that spend did slow down around the start of the war in Ukraine, but then recovered in April. So can you tell us your thought maybe in more detail about what the advertising environment is in Europe right now and where it’s going in your view? The second question is about political. You did make some comments on it, but wanted to see if you could give us more detail. So broadcasting companies have been reporting, and they’re saying that they see a record political cycle spending so far. So can you tell us, please, how you feel you are positioned? And do you think this could be some incremental revenue growth this year from political?\\nJeff Green: Yes. Sounds great. I’m going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them, and then I’ll also take time with both of them. So Blake?\\nA –Blake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So with regards to Europe, just first to put into context, historically, our growth has been driven by the very strong position we have in the U.S. Europe represents a single-digit share of our spend. CTV has been the primary driver behind our growth in the U.S., but European CTV also gaining share. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about that more than doubled – they grew in the triple digits in Q1. We did see more of that gap – of a gap between North America and international in the second half, but it did – it recovered a bit in April and recovered back to what we were seeing in January. But there is still some room to improve. I think that, that’s not a surprise, I think, for people who follow the space. The thing I think about when I think about opportunities like that is when customers become more deliberate with spend and they focus on the most efficient investment opportunities, that’s when The Trade Desk tends to shine because from my perspective, we proved it out in the second half of 2020 when we saw that as people needed to be more deliberate, they were focusing on the areas of investment that have the highest ROI, then they were consulting with us, and it worked out actually quite well in our favor. So I’m super optimistic about that. With regards to political, yes, it’s a great opportunity for us, and we’ll see how this ramps up because it’s going to probably start ramping up for us over the summer into November, obviously. You’ve seen reports that talk about midterm election spend on par or better than the 2020 presidential elections. The one thing I would encourage you to think about as you go through the forecasting is that seasonality is going to be different than we saw in 2020, so you’ll need to take that into account. There’s still a lot of factors to consider like the number of competitive races out there and stuff. But we do believe we’ve set ourselves up to be the kind of go-to platform for this political advertising versus maybe social media platforms and such. And we’ll have more color on this as we progress in 2022, more in the second half of the year, but definitely look forward to some tailwinds there. And then whatever, Jeff, you want to add on top.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. I’ll just add a little bit more color. So first, I’ve been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months, and that’s in large part because there’s just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets, we’re seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadn’t embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players, we’re seeing them move relatively quickly, which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where there’s pauses or there’s – I’ve seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA, the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So I’ve got both of the trips in the last 4 months, more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks, which is when there’s some economic pressure or they have to do more with less, they become very data-driven, and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And that’s exactly what I’m seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political, I’ll just underline what Blake said on – the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But I’ll just say lastly, on the political, we – I’m really proud of what we’ve proven in the last couple of election cycles, which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way, there’s room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums, including, in some cases, in social. So we’re really excited about what we’ve proven in the past and believe that we’ve set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: I’ll just ask one. Just want to focus back on CTV. So for a very long time, Google wanted to get into this, and the media companies don’t want them basically doing programmatic CTV. While they let them do YouTube TV, right, that YouTube isn’t doing the ads. And we’ve seen media companies try to own technology assets – ad tech assets and have not been good at it. And I guess, Jeff, your perspective, I mean, given what we’ve now almost seen as kind of like the undoing of some of the media mergers, where there’s like a clear idea that content owners need to be content owners and maybe just be the best of that because it’s so competitive, just how do you see how that kind of impacts your space on the board, and ultimately, to be potentially like the default partner to help the media companies with this transition?\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I think your assessment sort of that’s built into your question is spot on. I just – I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think it’s really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disney’s, of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think that’s somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think it’s just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space, being one of, and in many cases, the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world, and they’re leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. It’s just really incredible. And that’s largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We don’t own any content. We are constantly – well, publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain, but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think that’s the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are, to some extent, doing the exact same thing, they – even companies like that, that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because we’re all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything, right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic, especially in the intersection of media and tech.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\\nBrent Thill: Maybe if you can give us a quick update on Walmart and any critical milestones that you’ve had and how you look at that through the second half of ‘22.\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. Yes. If there’s any topic that didn’t get its due, it’s – I don’t know, it’s a rival between our data marketplace and our shopper marketing efforts. And so as I did mention, though, we just finished our first full quarter with Walmart. We saw over 200 advertisers. These are all very large brands – provide test budgets during that time. We expect even more large brands and more expansion as we continue forward. And we think that this is going to be just an amazing growth driver over the next 5 years. We, of course, saw some early tests and some amazing results from CPGs, as you might expect. But I don’t know that enough has been said about what is being done by companies like Walgreens and Target and Drizly, and this Target’s division Roundel because what they’re largely doing is really changing the way measurement works in CPG and really anything that’s primarily built – I’m sorry, bought off-line because what it makes possible is the ability t’ measure from the –me’you show the ad to the time somebody buys the product and measure that end-to-end using retail data instead of a walled garden or technology companies sort of grading their own homework data. And so by having that collection there, we now put together this mosaic that really creates this amazing marketplace that we even call the measurement marketplace for anybody that’s selling products that are largely bought in those stores. And then, of course, those stores spin their flywheel faster. So the green shoots are fantastic. We’ve merely scratched the surface, but we’re very excited about the start that we’ve had and very excited about our partnerships with Walmart, Walgreens and Drizly, Roundel, and GoJet and Flybuys and so many others. I’m not even listing half of the internationals, but very excited about all the progress.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, I was just hoping you could maybe define what you consider the large publisher market in terms of having, I guess, the majority of loyal signed-in users and how many you think you need to sign on to UID2 for your platform to come close to replacing cookie scale, when and if Google shuts down cookies? And then just in terms of UID2, what's the status on finding an administrator for UID2, and particularly the importance of that in Europe? Appreciate answers to those.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users, it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on, but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept, there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in, in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly, this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general, we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in, in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much, much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?\\nMark Zgutowicz: Yes. So I was just wondering if you – what the progress is on finding an administrator for UID2? By administrator, meaning somebody who’s willing to accept liability for violations of GDPR.\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. So because of the fact that – so first, there’s a European issue, and then there’s the administrator issue in other parts of the world as well, including in the United States. The position that we’ve taken so far is that we wanted to make UID2 an open source project so that it was available to everybody and sort of administering or managing that code base so that it could be available to everybody was the most important first order of business. And that we’ve done with the IAB, and we’ve done that based here in the United States, but it’s available everywhere in the world. As it relates to administration of its operation, because essentially, you’re handing over control at that point, it’s a double-edged sword. You can hand over a liability. You can also hand over some of its future. That’s something that we want to be very certain is good and secure before we hand that off. So we’re in no rush to do that, whether that’s with [IV] in the United States or any entity in Europe. And because in Europe, everybody is essentially taking some amount of risk if you take on the role of controller. So I don’t believe that it’s an effective way to distribute or mitigate risk at this point. So there’s nothing – we’re in no rush to do that. And instead, what we want to make certain that we do, especially in Europe, but really everywhere around the world, is develop a system that can scale and make sure that early on, we partner with companies that we believe are being responsible, that are doing the right thing and that we establish very clearly the quid pro quos and opt-outs that are in compliance with GDPR. And we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant ID in the world, but we will make it interoperable with others that we believe are also doing the right thing, and that’s going to create a better Internet, one that I think is really important for Europe and optimistic that we’ll continue to see scale. But we’re much more early days in EUID than we are in UID2 because there’s just a lot more things to consider and a much more political environment. So I’m just excited of the progress at this point.\\nOperator: The final question will be from Michael Morris from Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: I’ll try to squeeze in 2 final questions. The first one is on the pretty consistent comment that you made, Jeff, about The Trade Desk being the default DSP for the open Internet. Obviously, this implies potential for a pretty universal adoption across buyers. So I’m curious if you can elaborate on where you are now in terms of partner penetration. You referenced over 1,000 customers. But any frame of reference or what that means for full penetration, sort of how that’s been trending would be helpful. And the second question is a little bit of elaboration on the impacts of Netflix and other peers introducing these global ad-supported businesses, which are pretty new to market, of course. Does this drive an acceleration in your investment internationally? Any other kind of fundamental changes that this makes to the industry?\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. So as it relates to partner penetration, I’m trying to think of the best way to quantify it. In general, I believe that we have only scratched the surface. I’m sometimes referencing last year, we had over $6 billion flow through the platform, but we’re still looking at a nearly $1 trillion TAM in terms of what’s spent in total global advertising. So we’re still just merely scratching the surface and a tiny amount of what’s possible. When you look at how many of those dollars are spent in the Fortune 500, while we’re very encouraged by what we’ve done inside of the Fortune 500 among the biggest advertisers, when you become the default for them and learn how to support the most sophisticated in the world, of course, it then gives you room to do similar things for midsized businesses, midsized agencies as we’ve always supported agencies. We continue to expand among – more and more midsized agencies, and that’s giving us a wider variety of clients, which is why we added so many advertisers both directly and through agencies in Q1. So I think this was a quarter where we added more to the sort of quantity of advertisers and agencies than we usually have. But it then tees up the opportunity for us to then get a greater share of wallet where I think there’s just still way more upside than sort of dollars we already have. You asked if the – the expansion that we’re seeing, especially from these global CTV players, if that will increase our investment around the world. I do think it will. Maybe not immediately, but I believe that investment will happen in the coming months and quarters. And that’s largely because it’s difficult to pay for a subscription and avoid the ads. Like in the prepared remarks, I made that reference or the analogy to traditional television where it’s really a luxury to pay for a station that doesn’t have any ads. It costs more. And so if you think about most markets outside the United States have a median household income that is lower than the United States. And so as a result, most of them would prefer to pay by seeing ads than by paying a premium. And especially if you’re fighting like hell to go get more subscribers, that becomes the very best way for you to grow in new markets. Incidentally, advertisers also love that, especially when you’re looking at places like Asia, but even some of the markets in Europe, where there’s just such a growth of middle class not to – occur – or occurring right now that just is a great time to advertise when people’s wealth is growing for the first time to levels that give them sort of unprecedented purchasing power. So I definitely think that will result in investments from us around the world. And I do think it will change the CTV landscape around the world to have companies that were historically U.S. companies that continue to become more of a force internationally. And I think ad-supported business models will make them stronger competitors around the world, not weaker.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.\",\n",
       "   'Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Trade Desk’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today from our Singapore office are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I am thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it’s been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth and it’s always inspiring to spend time here, more on that later, but first, on to our results. As you have seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled gardens in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment. Our vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found as we have predicted CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet, when possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren’t comparable to others. In short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever, because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side roadmap and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street. Because of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JBPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JBPs position the Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JBPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media, whether it’s decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising. With this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing. WPP’s GroupM predictive worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022 and we are growing at more than 3x that rate. CTV continues to be a key growth driver and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it’s only our third full quarter total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3. As we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk and more of the world’s leading retailers are also now following suit. The chorus of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet, while CTV maybe the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second. Political also continues to perform well. Mid-term election – over mid-term election, we have exponentially grown our business. We are proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides. With all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I’d like to touch on three areas. First is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet even in a volatile macro environment; second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value; and last is the critical mass of support that is growing around Unified ID 2.0. And why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet. So first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens. You only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world’s largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, “it is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend. That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.” Back in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hint of uncertainty. But what you are hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world everyday now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world’s most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform. We provide objective transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance and we provide access to the world’s most advanced data marketplace including many of the world’s biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals. We recently ran a campaign for Clarence, one of the world’s largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the UK. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multi-channel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement. As a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest. For years now, we have been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I will make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I have said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets like the UK and France are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category. Let me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C-class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets. ViewSonic is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets such as India, the Philippines, Germany and UK. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign. Back in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year, with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets. Our success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV. Not enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators who have long histories in advertising and what they are doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers’ experience. Peacock is one of our longest standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I am thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance. UID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let’s remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There is nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns. One of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo and the results they have seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad-spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform. The adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have. One of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world’s leading data aggregators such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world’s leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without it ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year, will be UID2 tag. With more and more of our publishers’ inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year. With this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year, because we have done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision, and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond. I’d like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I have spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices such as Melbourne and New Delhi as we have benefited from new JBPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here. As I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That’s true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand. Many inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile, and of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia-Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead. To come back to where I started in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don’t often comment on competitor performance, I do think it’s worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we are gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform. I could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we have discussed today and we will continue to innovate to lead the market and I am confident that the world’s leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail. As our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double-digits, while many companies in the ad funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We have also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers and we are building trust with our clients for the long-term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We are seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI. Q3 was another example of our ability to grow top line while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long-term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I’m fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions. From a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we’re encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend. Despite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget. Every ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we’re starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company’s unbiased partnership with them and that we don’t own inventory, we don’t compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021. While uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Hi, guys. Nice job on execution. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you expand and talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing with the macro? And then separately, just how you see the setup as we go into next year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, could you just talk a little bit more about the 4Q guide and just some of your assumptions there? Thank you, guys.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the question. So let me first start with the macro and talk about this year. So I don’t know that I have ever been more proud of our performance than what we just put up in Q3. And that’s in large part because of the relative outperformance where most other stocks are either negative or reporting single-digit growth. We put up 31% and we’re doing that in an environment that is a little bit more uncertain. If there was an advertising mix, it would be at an all-time high and it’s hard to say whether that’s because of macro headwinds or mostly macro uncertainty, but it would be high because of one of those themes in each case. But because we’re definitely in an environment regardless of where that’s coming from, where advertisers have to do more with less, it means more that we’re winning share in this environment. And I definitely believe that we’re grabbing land. So I take a lot of comfort in what Procter & Gamble said in their earnings report, which is that we are actively shifting our spend from linear and non-targeting TV into programmatic and digital that is a lot more precise. And so when you look at just the overall macro environment, I just think we’re just doing so incredibly well on a relative basis, that it’s hard not to be proud, it’s hard not to look at what we’ve done and see grabbing land. But when you turn our attention to 2023, and you start to look at all the new inventory that’s going to come into CTV, whether that’s from Disney+ or digital inventory from Peacock or HBO or Netflix or Paramount Plus or Fox or ESPN or Hulu or the fact that we reported in earnings that this year 11 markets outside the United States outperformed in the United States in premium video or connected television. And then you look at the UID tailwinds that we have, we just surpassed 600 partners in UID and that we’re activating data at an unprecedented level. We are going to go from a minority of our – or I’m sorry, of our data on our platform being enabled by UID to the majority of our third-party data being enabled by the beginning of next year. So we’ll finish that work this year going from minority to majority. I do believe that in 2023, we will have the best data marketplace that the ecosystem has ever had. I think we will have the best first-party data onboarding that we’ve ever had. And that’s not even talking about OpenPath, which we didn’t really have time to talk about in our prepared remarks, which will be direct integrations with hundreds of the world’s largest content owners and that will accelerate our growth and land grabbing around the world irrespective of the macro environment in 2023. And of course, last but not least, with us partnering with over 80% of the largest retailers in the United States and of course, partnering with many all over the world, all of those trends point to an incredible opportunity for us in 2023, that wouldn’t be possible without the grabbing of land that we’re doing right now. So with that, I’ll pass it over to Blake to just talk a little bit more about the second part of your question.\\nBlake Grayson: Hey, thanks, Shyam, for the question. So your question on Q4, just to start off on Q3, again, fundamentally great quarter, actually pretty steady, too, which was great to see 31% revenue growth off a relatively hard comp last year of 39%. And political has ramped up for us as well. So like you’ve already seen standout performance versus peers who are growing at much smaller or negative rates, again, CTV led the way, still opportunity there. Shopper marketing is ramping up well for us, too. The Solimar adoption is exciting. We’ve got the momentum on UID as well. And so just grabbing share from company zone, and you’ve heard us talk about these JBPs as well. That’s also been ramping and has been strong. And so as you think about, as when we think about going into Q4 in our setup, again, relative to the rest of the industry in Q4, we’re growing significantly faster, which, in my mind, just confirms we’re grabbing share. Advertisers are be more deliberate. I just personally believe we’re in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID. As a Chief Financial Officer or CFO, I definitely appreciate the uncertainty that so many of my peers are facing right now, right? Like the best CFOs are actively working to rationalize the investments that they are making and they are prioritizing the ones that have proven measurable returns. And in that environment, The Trade Desk we gained share because companies are now prioritizing programmatic as the first place to invest that first dollar. So while you can obviously dial programmatic up and down quickly, it’s doing really well for us. And to me, that just shows the power and the value of this model. Now specifically with regards to Q4 a couple of thoughts, not only is our Q4 sequential growth well into the double digits as many app funded companies are flat or negative. We’re actually forecasting accelerating growth on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And I recognize that there’s a political impact in there. But when I just step back a bit and look at a year-over-year acceleration in Q4 in this environment, to me, that’s a standout performance for us and it gives us a lot of optimism about our future and the momentum that we’ve got. And I hope that helps.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First, maybe, Blake, can you talk about the – how you look at the expense structure for 2023, maybe talk about the puts and takes, growth versus the need to invest more? Do you expect margins to improve relative to where you are for – or will you end up in 2022? And Jeff, maybe going back to connected TV, very impressive kind of both numbers and color commentary. Can you maybe speak to the competitive positioning that you guys have relative to other CTV players? And do you believe that you are actually gaining share or losing share relative to other players that arguably are also benefiting from growth in CTV next year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Blake, first I’ll take the second and Tim, if you don’t mind, adding color after I deal on CTV.\\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Hi, Youssef, thanks for the question. So with regards to thinking about expense structure in 2023 and such I really just like stepping back a bit to remind everyone that the business model in the situation we’re in highly desirable, right? We’ve got a situation where we’re driving high top line growth. We’ve got high adjusted EBITDA growth with strong margins. And we’ve got not only strong free cash flow generation, but consistent free cash flow generation. So having all of those working together, which they are, it gives us an opportunity and ability to be deliberate with the choices that we make. I’m just also super proud of our ability to stay disciplined with our investments regardless of the operating environment. I – there’s a lot of companies out there that might have more resources than us that are pausing or even cutting their resources because they potentially invested too aggressively. And we didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. I think maybe like some of these companies did, and that’s paid off for us. We have the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and that includes hiring. As we think about 2023 specifically, should we see any significant changes in the situation, we definitely have levers available to make changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 during COVID, we can adapt. But still, the expense structure of the company today is better than it was pre-pandemic. But overall though, and I’ve said this on a number of calls, we’re always looking for ways to invest and drive growth that we think pays off for the long run. For 2023 specifically, I would say a couple of things. We do expect return-to-office expenses like travel and live events to return to pre COVID levels. And the other thing to keep in mind is I would expect seasonality of our expenses next year to be a bit more like 2016 to 2019 than they were in 2020, 2021. And just for example, we have our large company event that will finally move back to its regular timing in Q1, it was held in Q2 of this year. That’s just a great opportunity to bring our team together, especially after what’s gone on in the past few years, whether we’re solidifying our culture, framing our strategy versus the opportunity we’ve got. And also just highlighting, again, the discipline perspective we take as a company about driving profitable growth. So looking into 2023, I think we’re in a great position to drive more scale and efficiency and free cash flow. And we have so many opportunity areas to focus on. I’m really excited about that. And then...\\nJeff Green: I’ll start on CTV and then Tim if you want to speak to it as well. So I really think there’s two parts to talk about on the CTV question. The first is just talk about the category a little bit and then also to just talk about why we win specifically inside the category. So of course, right now, at The Trade Desk, we’re living a secular tailwind that I don’t know that we’ve ever seen before, and I don’t know that we’ll ever see again and that is going to continue into 2023, largely because of the amount of inventory that is coming online. But also as you look across the open Internet, and whether that’s inside of display or native or audio or any other channel because CTV is leading the way in forging the future of identity, CTV is not just leading in our business and not just the most interesting thing happening in programmatic, but it’s the most interesting thing happening in ad-funded media. And so as a result, CTV is the first – is quickly becoming the place where people spend their very first dollar and was not surprised at all to see our partner, Disney+ report 12 million new subscribers. And of course, Netflix added a couple of million themselves on just the promise of an ad-funded option coming soon. So there’s more inventory coming online, programmatic we’ll just continue to drive CTV. And I do believe that very soon, CTV will be the most data-driven channel. And that to me is one of the things to really just focus on in terms of why we’re winning inside of CTV. So why are we winning above everyone else. So in order to be competitive, you do have to be omni-channel. So you can’t just be focused on CTV because you take the data and the learnings from all other channels and then apply those to CTV where CTV is a top of the funnel activity where you’re typically creating awareness. And then all the other channels are follow-ups, if you will, to that really effective moving picture and sound that happens inside of CTV. And so in order to be most effective, you have to be holistic. So you have to be omnichannel, but you also have to be global and then very importantly, you have to be objective, which means you can’t compete with any of the content owners, which is one of the themes that is really a problem for most of the walled gardens, especially Google, which is that, of course, they have their own media in YouTube. And so content creators are not eager to part with somebody – or to partner with somebody that they compete with in their very – in the core of their business. So by being objective and not competing with them by being global, by being omni-channel and then there’s something that we say all the time to every content owner on the Internet, and that is that you have to have an authentication strategy and you have to have an identity strategy. And we’re able to go to the content owners and partner with them on both of those things. And you see this with Disney. Disney is doing extremely well. We’ve been very vocal. They have been very vocal about our partnership on UID. It is a part of their authentication and identity strategy. That is what makes personalized ads possible. That’s what makes high CPM as possible. That’s what makes low ad loads possible. So we become a really critical partner for them while not competing with them because we’re objective. You put all that together, and that’s the reason we’re winning. But I’m sure Tim, you can say more about this.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Youssef, thanks for the question. And as I look out next year and kind of why I think we’re differentiated and in a position to win, it’s a little bit of what Jeff said. So you’ve got a lot more inventory coming online. So as Jeff pointed out, we’ve got Disney+ and Netflix, they get a lot of the word count in the ecosystem right now. But let’s not forget, HBO Max, Paramount NBCU, Fox, the rest of Disney, Hulu, ESPN, ABC, etcetera are continuing to lean into programmatic. And the reason that they lean into us is if you think about it from their perspective, and they look back at the ecosystem of people who do what we do, a lot of those companies are competing with them. So they lean in heavily with us and they partner with us in a number of different ways, including on identity. So UID2, through our partnership with Disney, I think, is going to be a major catalyst for the CTV category. As a result, that inventory is going to have much richer decisioning going into next year across the entire category. So when I think about 2023, there’s this like perfect collision of addressability and scale in the premium content space that we’ve never seen before. And I think that’s going to be a huge benefit to The Trade Desk because it’s mostly to date in this CTV story. And I think in 2023, it’s going to be a programmatic CTV story. And so I’m really excited for that in 2023 because I think all of these things combining that addressability and that scale is going to create an environment for CTV to be the most data-driven channel in programmatic next year. And I am really excited for that. And as a result, I think CTV is going to very quickly become the first dollar spent in digital media, and I think The Trade Desk is well positioned going into next year.\\nYoussef Squali: Super helpful.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Laura Martin with Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey, Jeff, just following up on your comments about ID on connected television, the MAD data shows that 80% of viewing on connected television is shared does seem to undermine some of the targeting benefits that we had on individual devices like smartphones and tablets. That’s my first question. And then my second is China. You’re sitting in Singapore and you’re noticeably silent on China. So could you give us an update on what’s going on with China and your business these days? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Fantastic. Thanks, Laura. Really appreciate the question. So when it comes to shared viewing or the impact that, that has on CPMs or does it pose a threat to the ecosystem or is it a problem for CTV, let me just first sort of answer that emphatically, by saying it’s not a problem for the ecosystem whether you frame it is CTV worth it. The answer is yes. Does it have a frequency capping problem, the answer is no. The bottom line is when we are considering, targeting or customizing ads, there is an individual graph, there is a household graph. Both of those are considered when we are making the placement of ads and shared viewing doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s worth any less. And in fact, what we are competing with is an environment in linear or broadcast television that is almost always shared viewing, but it’s not measurable. So, finally, we have the ability to measure when it’s being shared and when it’s not. And of course, a lot of premium video is on personalized devices. And I have been reminded about it again and again this week as I am here in Asia and reminded how much premium video is consumed on mobile devices. So, household and individual graphs are both considered, but when you compare the sort of spray and pray a broadcast or traditional television, into the efficacy, the targeting, the identity-driven lower ad load with content that is more premium, you put all of that together, the impact on digital is exponentially more valuable than a linear broadcast and the efficacy has gone up way more than the cost. And as that phenomenon continues to unfold in 2023 that Tim was just describing really well, which is that it’s becoming a programmatic story where there is more inventory, and we can select more and more from the sort of wider selection of ads, the personalization, the customization, the efficacy is only going to continue to go up. So, it’s absolutely worth the shared viewing. I don’t even view as an issue. I don’t spend time thinking about it. So, as it relates to China, China is of course, one of the largest markets in the world, and we are constantly keeping our eye on the fact that while as a media market, it’s about half the size of the United States. It is growing at twice the pace. As you recall, last year, China was our fastest-growing office in the world. This year, that hasn’t been true, but that’s largely just because of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. So, we have been quiet, in large part because of those geopolitical issues and because there has been some slowdown. If the geopolitical issues weren’t enough, there is also COVID lockdown that has affected them in a very significant way. But we have been quarter-over-quarter, up over 100% in this environment. Shanghai is no longer our smallest office, which it was just 18 months ago. And we just – we continue to believe that while the English-speaking world has led much of CTV, the Chinese-speaking world is the second most important as it relates to the premium video play and that we continue to look at China and all the Chinese-speaking nations of the world as a very important battleground for the future of global television and premium video, so still excited and bullish just a bunch of things that make a fair amount of uncertainty. Thanks, Laura. Appreciate the question.\\nChris Toth: Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Two, if I can. Jeff, as you exit the year and have these data initiatives and OpenPath kicking in the year, how should we think about the competitive landscape and how that looks in 2023 versus what we have observed in the past? If I look at some recent commentary by Proctor & Gamble, it seems like there is a lot more programmatic budget and relationships up for grabs heading into next year. And then for Blake, I appreciate your color on the Q4 guide. Could you please put a finer point on some of the trends you observed quarter-to-date? And how we should think about growth over the rest of the quarter? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I think you are right in that. There is more and more budget that’s going into programmatic. I think the commentary that we have heard from Procter & Gamble is indicative of that. As you have heard us say before, the supply chains of the open Internet, but really the supply chains of the entire ad-funded Internet have become a little bit murky and as often happens when markets mature, become just much more complicated. So, it becomes more and more important for us to be obsessing about supply chains or supply pads. I have said before that I think one way to characterize the success of Amazon, it is that they have had an executive team that has just obsessed about the supply chain and just making certain that they are getting things as efficiently as possible so that they can deliver to their consumers the best product as fast as possible for the best possible price. We have applied that same sort of obsession to the media supply chain, which in some ways is even more complicated. And we have said, as often as possible, we want to make certain that no one in the middle is taking more in fees or tax than they are adding in value. And we do believe that, that happens a fair amount of time because of complication and because of sort of draconian tactics of some of the biggest tech players in the world. Our way of combating that is to release products like OpenPath, where we plug in directly with the biggest publishers in the world. We have had a number of conversations with content creators, whether that’s in CTV or in mobile apps or in traditional web development, where they have said they don’t feel like anyone is representing them the way they would like to and they would like to do their own yield management and plug in with us directly. That creates a more efficient supply chain, while us maintaining our role on the buy side as well as our objectivity. So, when you couple that with all the data initiatives going into 2023, and I have said in the prepared remarks that I believe because of Unified ID data, especially first-party data will be 10x more valuable in 2023 than it’s ever been historically. And that’s largely just because of the math of UID and the scale of UID and not having to sync like we did in cookies, not only is the Internet getting an upgrade because we are going from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet, but we are also getting rid of some of the clunkiness that cookies had, which makes a data-driven Internet just so much more effective. And of course, it’s better for consumers when it’s opt-in. You put all that together, we have a more effective supply chain. While budgets are up for grabs, we think that we are more likely to get the first dollar than anyone else. And what has happened over the most of the history of The Trade Desk is that we got the leftovers from search and social and the walled gardens. And what’s starting to happen now is we are getting the very first dollar, and that’s happening more and more. We expect that to continue as a secular tailwind that CTV continues. So, I appreciate the question.\\nBlake Grayson: And then, Justin, just on your question on the Q4 trend, one way maybe to think about it is, it’s a little bit of a tale of two cities like and you have heard us say this before, like or a cave shape recovery, if you will, for certain verticals. Some areas like travel and auto are outperforming and they are making up for lost time. Some areas are more challenged. You have heard us talk about Europe, but as we have said that before. But specific to Europe, as we have said, we have seen incredible CTV growth there, which is amazing in light of the macro challenges. So, it makes me super optimistic for the future for us there. And then the automotive growth, especially it’s been especially exciting to see some gains there. We have won new business and then some more existing from existing customers after a period of volatility over the past 2-or-so years. And so I think that – and then even if you talk about CPG companies, you got some that are doing incredibly well and then some that still have some supply chain challenges as well. So, I think that the breadth of the advertisers and the verticals that we represent bodes super well for us and like there is still areas of opportunity for us to gain share there, too.\\nJustin Patterson: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Justin.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Tom White at D.A. Davidson.\\nTom White: Great. Thanks. Given the elections here yesterday, I thought I would ask a question on political. Jeff, any big takeaways around political ad spend this cycle? Any learnings that we should kind of take away that you are taking away as to the future of political ad spend on CTV and I guess, just digital broadly? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, one thing that’s happened in the past is that we have seen them sort of focus on social and other parts of political. But what we have definitely seen this time is that CTV is the preferred channel for political advertisers, and it’s playing a larger role in every election cycle. One thing that is just really important for me to note is that as there has been more and more mistrust of specific tech platforms in the political environment, we are really proud of the work that we have done to focus on providing a better democratic process for both sides of the aisle and making certain that our platform is objective and independent so that we can power both Democrats and Republicans and anybody else for that matter. And I think our team has done a phenomenal job over really the last decade in winning trust and providing reassurance to both sides that we are going to provide them with an objective platform that’s going to make it possible for them to do the very best and sort of let the process do its thing. It’s our job to run a better process not to advocate for specific candidates or to get in the middle politics more specifically. And as a result of creating that arm’s length relationship, we once again believe we have run a better process and been a key contributor to running a healthy election. We expect that to grow in 2024 as we move into the next presidential cycle. But once again, CTV plays a very significant role, and we think it will play a bigger role in every election going forward. And we are really excited to see the election or election growth and expect that to continue into the future. So, I appreciate the question.\\nTom White: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Tom.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, I want to know if you could talk about your decisioning intensity in CTV maybe versus other channels, particularly in the context of private marketplace deals and things of that ilk. Do you do as much heavy lifting there versus other channels? And do you get pushed back on pricing and any differences in the intensity there and also in CPMs?\\nJeff Green: Yes. I appreciate the question, Brian. So, we have been asked some form of this question over time in various ways. And it’s essentially to say do we add less value in CTV, or should we be charging less? So, it’s – are just two different ways of asking that question. And I would argue that we add more value in CTV than we do in any other channel. And also the value that we are adding is going up over time. So, the first part of that is the reason why we are adding more value is because the stakes are higher. If you in the stock market, if you buy stocks at random or you buy them all in ETFs, they tend to go up over time. But if you buy ads at random, you will get your kicked every single time that you have to select very carefully. And in the world of CTV, when you are buying very highly expensive or high-cost impressions, the stakes are higher. You have to make certain that you use data to buy the right ones, you have to get reach and frequency right. And I would argue the only platform in the world that manages reach and frequency well on CTV is The Trade Desk. So, we add more value. And as time goes on, when you add more impressions, there is more opportunity to outperform and select more carefully. So, while there have been a series of PMPs or ways of buying and limited decisioning methodologies, those have gone down over time. And those are typically training wheels are on ramps for advertisers that over time are replaced with just high decisioning. And that’s where all of our biggest advertisers are heading. That’s where our product has done. And we think over time that we just continue to add more value for essentially the same cost as we do in everything else, but our take rate having remained the same, pretty much our entire existence as a publicly traded company. So, I think it’s something that has been important for us to clarify. And so I really appreciate the question, Brian.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks Jeff.\\nChris Toth: Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, just a UID follow-up, we have heard concerns that publishers are being slow to adopt UID. What can you do to speed up adoption? And how are you thinking about this? Do you agree? Do you disagree? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I am constantly reminded that if you sat me down a year ago and said Jeff, write up a dream list of adopters. I don’t think I could have fictionalized or made up a list that’s more impressive than those that we have actually added AWS, Salesforce, Snowflake, Adobe, you heard us saying a year ago that we needed to add the infrastructure of the Internet. And those and hundreds of others represent that infrastructure with now approaching 600 partners. And that doesn’t even underscore the entire infrastructure of the data ecosystem of the Internet, names like Experian or InfoSum or so many others. So, with all of those coming online and then you add the CTV players companies like Disney, who have adopted it, and it will be just really critical next year that all CTV players are leveraging UID in order to get the personalization and the high CPMs that they all desperately need to compete. When you put all that together, I actually don’t have any idea where that assertion is coming from that publishers are going slow. The only way that I could possibly make sense of that, just that some of them, it takes a little bit of time to prioritize and actually implement. But in terms of commitment or signing or prioritizing, it’s there across the board. And we have so much momentum on the issue that I honestly, a year ago wouldn’t have thought it’s possible for us to have the momentum that we have now. And I believe it’s just critical for companies, especially content owners to be leveraging that in order to do well. And you will see us in 2023 push really hard to enable advertisers to bring their first-party data to bear. And I do think that, that will represent a very strong rebuttal to the value propositions of walled gardens and the leverage of first-party data and their ecosystems. Because here, they will get to put their first-party data to work and then measure relative performance, learn from it, take the learnings with them so that they can continue to improve their marketing and not just outsource advertising and marketing to walled gardens, which has historically been the only option that they have had. So, UID plays a really critical role in the future of the open Internet, and it’s doing its job.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Let’s take one more question Holly.\\nOperator: Your final question for today is coming from Michael Morris at Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning guys. I have two topics I would like to ask about. One about the joint business plan momentum and one about Asia. So, on the first topic of the JBPs, I would love to hear how – if there is some way you could quantify or help us understand how much more valuable a partnership through a JBP is compared to sort of your run rate business or somebody, a partner who is not involved in one of those, how much value does it add? And also how penetrated is the market at this point for those? How much more runway do you feel you have with respect to the kind of addressable market for partners that are of this size that it makes sense for. So, that’s the first topic. And then the second just on Asia. Jeff, you did spend a lot of time talking about the opportunity there. The Asia-Pac market historically has been a pretty tough market for Western companies as they compete with local players. So, I would love to hear a little bit about why you think you can be successful where maybe some companies in the past have not? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thank you. I am going to have Tim take the first part of the question on the JBPs, then I will add some color and talk about Asia.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Michael, thanks for the question on the JBPs. I will kind of try to cover everything that you mentioned there. So, first, starting with what’s the difference between a JBP and a typical engagement. One of the major differences in the JBP is that these tend to be multiyear agreements between The Trade Desk and a brand or agency. And they tend to set kind of a partnership framework that often includes milestones for that partnership over that multiyear agreement, which is typically a longer period of time than a standard MSA that we would sign with a client. So, within that framework, typically the way that these work is that the advertiser, we sit down and we set goals for ourselves around things like how do we move more spend into the platform, how do we think about adjusting their investment mix moving it towards more data-driven advertising, how do we think about using platform features that they may be underutilizing. It’s a really great framework to structure how we build a stronger partnership with that brand or agency over a longer period of time. And one of the incredible benefits of that is it creates a lot of stickiness and engagement with our partners over that period of time because we are constantly checking in on achievement against those milestones. And I think the way that we look at those as just these longer term engagements is it really creates a lot of a deeper conversation with our partners so that we can really figure out how we are structuring these that are going to see the best interest of their business and how we can kind of jointly agree on what we are going to try to achieve together over a multiyear period. So, in the end, all that leads to a much more interesting and dynamic conversation and discussion over time. And we are really excited about the momentum that we have right now, and we are expecting to continue to build on that into the future with more JBPs with more clients.\\nJeff Green: Thanks Tim. Well, said, I don’t have anything to add on the JBPs. I am excited to weigh in on Asia, though, because I really appreciate your question. And of course, we are also all sitting here in Singapore and nearing our 10-year anniversary of being here in the Asia market where we started here in Singapore. So, we have a team in our company that we are not an American company, we are a global company that happens to be based in the United States. And can we be successful in Asia, my response is we already are. 11 markets in CTV or premium video grew faster than the United States for us. So, when I say 11 markets, I am not – I am not talking about it in general. I am talking about The Trade Desk markets. Our spend grew faster in 11 markets for premium video outside the United States than it did inside the United States, the fastest region for growth around the world, Southeast Asia. It grew faster than Australia grew faster than North Asia, grew faster than Europe. It grew faster or South America. And that’s in large part because we are – just like in every other market, creating alternatives, especially UGC, where YouTube has a very dominant position in many of the markets here. But also you are seeing from the content creators that historically, they have had sort of a regional benefit where there is licensing that has prevented U.S. companies from competing with them in their markets. But one of the reasons why you have seen Australia a close rival to leading in terms of size or percentage of market moving to CTV with the U.S., those two leading the way is because with English language content that no longer having regional barriers, but English content is competing all over the world. And the same thing is happening with Chinese content and all others. So, what you are seeing is that the content owners are no longer viewing their next door neighbor in sort of broadcast as their biggest competitors, but instead looking at companies like Disney and Netflix is their biggest competitors around the world. So, they are all looking at the ad-funded options that those companies are creating around the world and saying that we quickly have to follow in order to compete. And so as a result, we are getting partnerships all over the world. We are setting up partnerships. That is the reason our executive team is here in Asia is because it’s not lost on us, but most of the GDP growth for the next 10 years is going to come out of Asia. And that in order for us to capture our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM, we have to be competitive in Asia as well as in other regions of the world. We are already doing that. And we have been doing that in this market despite things like the strong dollar and economic headwinds and some geopolitical issues, but we continue to do that because of strong partnership and a global mindset. And of course, we represent most of the largest brand in the world. And whether you are talking about Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, these brands advertise all over the world, and it’s not lost on them that GDP growth is going to come out of Asia. It’s not lost on them that the fastest-growing middle class in the world is here in Asia. So, you put all of that together, it’s a market that we are already winning in and we will continue to do so. We have over invested. If you look at our employee count versus our revenue, of course, we are early, not late. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Michael. And Holly, you can close up the call.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.',\n",
       "   'Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are both Founder and CEO, Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses and Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results could vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. Spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record. CTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. Our results are often benchmarked against the Rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company’s growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth. In times of market uncertainty, perhaps it’s most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by Dentsu, total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I’d like to focus on why we are winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future. Specifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we have reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth. I don’t think we have ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we’re gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they will prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens. With that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year, a more than two-thirds of the market according to Group M. What’s driving these two trends? Well, as I have said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. I’d like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions, because I think it will give you a sense of why I am so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I’d like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever and it’s because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I’d like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023. So, let’s start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is? A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those two consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google. Our goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incents more competition and improves privacy standards and that’s exactly what we are starting to see. If you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don’t think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solve the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy. To be clear, I am talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2. This is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we have ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser’s first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies, simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before. They can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value. At CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way. Of course, it’s not just on the data side that we are seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet, because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world’s leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we have talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio. Just a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn’t agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important and CTV will continue to lead the charge here, because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem. There is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad-supported lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there is pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way. Advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their targeted audience than without UID2. That’s astonishing progress. And it’s just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world. The CTV is the kingpin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open Internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It’s not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it’s fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rationale enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers, and of course, media companies. Because of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that every theme in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we will see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that’s the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years, but the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy. To adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today’s digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust to buy the CPMs required to power today’s content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data. We will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we’re hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what’s interesting about this event is that I don’t think there is any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising. It will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it’s not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, a global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as Vidio, WeTV and iflix. For this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they have been achieving against user-generated content and the click-through rate was 15x higher. In addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren’t possible a few years ago. The recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media. I’d like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there is a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy. As I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States and we are growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don’t exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens. Once again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023? From an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won’t be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the themes I am preparing for as the CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift. Retail Media Networks will continue to grow in influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic. First, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won’t be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value. Second, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel, because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market. As we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet. I will close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I’ve met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023 and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast growing channels like CTV, they are finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale. CMOs also understand that while the current macro environment maybe uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath. And the world’s leading media companies are integrating with us so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model. Everyone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven, decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet. Right now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and Retail Media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail. Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It’s a comprehensive look at how Google operates including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that’s because our mission has always been to provide an open objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens. We focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It’s the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another. I could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we’ve talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don’t like to comment on competitors’ performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment. We continue to sign JVPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways. And I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world. Q4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to share and significantly outpaces our peers on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the 9th year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides to our customers has increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy. Deliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business level. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy. Our shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It’s worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q4. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes. Unlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA. Income tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. And finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances. Turning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1. Turning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment. We’re also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. We are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs to the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022. In closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We’re executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we’re amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we’re adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Thank you. Hey, guys. Congrats on the continued strong performance. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about just what you’re seeing and how you’re thinking about the macro this year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, can you provide a bit more color on the 1Q guide and anything in terms of linearity, that’s worth noting? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: First of all, Shyam, thanks. I appreciate the question and the kind words. So first, let me just say that we’re incredibly proud of our performance in 2022 and the start to 2023, of course, especially on a relative basis. So far, of course, relative to all other scale ad platforms and companies, public or private, we feel like our relative outperformance is greater than it’s ever been during 2022 as well as so far in 2023. From a macro standpoint, in early January, we – it’s a little bit of a late start due to the calendar year. We also saw the way that both brands and agencies were planning was a little bit delayed. But then we’ve seen things start to unlock. And we saw instead of there being delayed – instead of there being canceled, there was just delays and then those have become unpaused and unlocked since then. As a result, we’ve seen more JVPs and we’ve seen a lot more activity so far in 2023 than we’ve seen at any time to this point in any year previously. So overall, we’re very encouraged by the trend in 2023 so far, extremely optimistic, especially as we continue to grab land relative to all of our competitors.\\nBlake Grayson: And Shyam, this is Blake. I’ll try to answer your other – your second question. Just to go back a bit on Q4 real quick. Fundamentally, a great quarter despite the macro uncertainty out there. I’m really happy with the 24% year-over-year growth. It’s a standout versus our peers, many of which seem to have shrunk in Q4. CTV again leads the way for us. We’re grabbing land now. It lays the foundation for us when times are better. In the prepared remarks, you heard me say data adoption is really encouraging as it spins our customers’ flywheels. With regards to the linearity question, just to lay a little bit more like what Jeff talked about, a bit larger deceleration in December than normal from what we saw in October and November. But we’ve accelerated off that pretty consistently so far here in Q1, which is really nice to see. So I’m cautiously optimistic for the quarter. Some places are more challenged because of that uncertainty. But we see strong growth, especially in CTV and relative to the rest of the industry, we’re growing significantly faster than I think so many of our peers who are signaling declining or negative growth, and we’re growing in into the double digits, which, to me, just confirms that we’re taking share. And so even though there is uncertainty out there, I think we could be in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID as advertisers are prioritizing programmatic spend more. The only other thing I’d maybe add about the Q1 guide, just want to comp perspective is if you exclude the political election spend that we had in Q4 ‘22 that low single-digit percent share of spend, our quarter-over-quarter seasonality is trending just slightly better than we’ve seen on average. So I feel really good about Q1 so far, and I’m optimistic about the quarter.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam, Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matt Swanson at RBC Capital Markets.\\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. I’ll add my congratulations on the execution as well. Jeff, I want to ask you on all the Google developments we’ve seen in the quarter. I think a lot of us have read your thought pieces on the subject, which have been really insightful. But could you elaborate a little bit on what you think the near and long-term impact on the market is of the antitrust? And I think especially the comment you made about the market will become more fair one way or another. And then if I could add a quick follow-up. There was a beta launch of the Privacy Sandbox for Android last night. Does this change any thoughts around maybe the potential cookie deprecation time line or how likely this is to happen?\\nJeff Green: Thanks a lot, Matt, for the kind words as well as the question. So let me first just talk about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. So let me just give the sort of punchline first, which is that I believe we will win regardless of the outcome. So no matter what happens, I think we’re going to win. We have been winning in an unfair market. So – of course, if the market becomes more fair, which we think it will, as a result of this, like I said, one way or another. Then of course, that signifies significantly better environment for us to perform it. The Department of Justice has clearly done their homework on this, which I am extremely encouraged by. I know there is some at Google who tried to suggest that we have been through this three or four times before. I do believe that this is fundamentally different. And part of that is just because of how detailed I think the case is outlined. I do believe there are many possible outcomes here. There is lots of people that are talking about breaking it up. There is lots of other potential outcomes. But I do believe that in any case, this will slow down Google, there is a 100% chance of that. And so with them slowed down, with the market moving towards just better competition and more fairness, I believe there is no way that this isn’t good for us. I do want to acknowledge that as there is some pressure to just break up assets, I don’t believe that, that alone is enough. And that if that’s all this done, I think technology could be replaced and some of the same practices that got us here could happen again. So to me, the most important thing that happens here is that any settlement or any conclusion to the case ends with more fairness and restrictions to make certain that the market stays fair, especially when leveraging assets that are extremely nearing monopoly, if you will. So as it relates to Privacy Sandbox, there has been a lot that have been discussed about Privacy Sandbox in the past. It’s often, I think, wrongly compared to the world of cookies and doesn’t necessarily acknowledge the importance of relevance in order to create a free and open Internet that can subsidize the content that currently exist on the open Internet. So I don’t actually think that, that has much to do with the antitrust case or the deprecation of cookies or UID2, but certainly something to launch.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, Matt. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, guys. And congrats again on the really strong execution, all things considered. So I have two questions, one for Jeff and one for Blake. Jeff, can you maybe just share with us, based on the commentary you’ve made about walled gardens, etcetera, what signals are you looking for as an indication that if walled gardens will begin to take down their barriers, what will that look like for you guys? And then, Blake, can you maybe talk about your OpEx or just your margin expectations? Your Q1 margin implies basically you’re back to pre-COVID levels. You have to go back to like ‘18, ‘19 to get down to those low 20s margins. Is that kind of the right way of thinking about the cadence throughout the year? And then do you expect margin improvement this year relative to last year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: I’ll have Blake first, and then I’ll follow on with the question about walled gardens.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. So let me just step back a second and then I’ll try to get to all the details of the questions that you asked. Just want to remind everyone about the power of this business model. I’m a huge fan of it. High top line, growth generates solid adjusted EBITDA with strong margins generate consistent free cash flow generation. I’m really proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments for the past few years really paid off for us. Unlike many companies, either in the ad funded space or in the technology space, we’ve been pretty responsible managing our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. So there is – while many companies are pulling back or making some very tough decisions about the resourcing, we’re able to say the core grab share, combine that with actually growing into the double digit contracting. I think it sets us up really well. As we think about our operating expenses next year, it will increase year-over-year. That’s a combination of a couple of things. It’s a combination of the 2022 hiring flow-through that we’ve had. It’s also a combination of return-to-office expenses, including travel and live events. But again, we’re going to be deliberate about our investments in hiring and you heard on the prepared remarks, we’re going to grow our headcount in 2023. But as of right now, we’re thinking roughly at half the rate of 2022. We still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV and shopper marketing and be ready to capture those. The other thing I would say about Q1 is also just the seasonality of live events, there were live events that occurred in Q2 of 2022, and those will happen in Q1 of 2023. So the seasonality is important to pay a little bit of attention to. But overall, the way I would just say it is we’re comfortable with where things stand. I’m cautiously optimistic about our growth at the start of the year. Should we see a significant change? We have levers available to us to make those changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 with regards to the COVID. And I believe the operating expense structure of the company is actually is better than prior to the pandemic when you deal with that kind of seasonality issue that I was talking about. We’re in a great position to drive more long-term scale and efficiency as well as free cash flow. So I feel pretty good about that. Now Jeff?\\nJeff Green: To the first part of the question as it relates to walled gardens. So first, let me just remind everybody what walled garden is and I’ll give you just one of the definitions, which is that this is a destination that is essentially a must-have on a media plan. So that the owner of that destination, whether it’s a social network or a video platform or any other walled garden, the owner of that can afford to be draconian and set their own rules. And what’s happening in part because of CTV because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV is perfectly fragmented. And what it does is it makes it so that there are enough players that no one can afford to be draconian. And no one has enough market share to do that. But it’s also concentrated enough that you have very large sophisticated players that are making decisions, and so they are all hypercompetitive and actually hyperrational. So what I think that does is it puts a lot of pressure on walled gardens because of the fact that there is this alternative that are super competitive and super efficient. When you add to that, the CTV is driven by nearly 100% authentication. It lends itself to just highly personalized content in a way that no other channel has to deal with, whether we are talking about in the mobile environment where IDs are under pressure, in part because of Google and Apple or in the browsing web for the same reason, we are – in CTV, we have authentication nearly all the time. Additionally, because of those UIDs, we also have the opportunity for retail to do exceptionally well and all of that puts pressure on walled gardens in the open Internet now poses as a very viable alternative. So, whether we are talking about CTV, whether we are talking about retail, whether we are talking about the economic environment and pressure that, that puts on walled gardens to want to welcome incremental demand. All of that points towards an ecosystem, where more and more of them are considering bringing down the walls even the largest of them so that they can welcome incremental demand. And certainly, an environment like this is where you are most likely to see some of those changes. So, there is lots of activity considering that sort of stuff. And I do believe you will see announcements in 2023 suggesting more and more walls coming down. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Youssef. Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Vasily Karasyov at Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Good morning. Jeff, can you please talk in more detail about the forward always on Connected TV event you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then connected to that, can you talk more about the – your forward market product that you mentioned today? And also, I think you spoke about it a couple of quarters ago. That seems like a very interesting product. And of course, fighting the upfront market is a pretty gargantuan task that you are undertaking here.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, Vasily first, I really appreciate the question. You are right. The upfront market is huge. But I see that as an opportunity, one, because it of course, adds to the TAM, but also because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the upfront market hasn’t changed since 1962, much. And really it’s a shame that it hasn’t changed because the way the upfronts work today is that you can’t really bring data to the table. And so CTV is in a very interesting position right now, which is that it has been getting a premium largely because their scarcity. So, consumers have moved into CTV, into on-demand, over the Internet content. But as they have moved, the number of ads available for advertisers to put in front of those consumers hasn’t gone up nearly as quickly as consumers have moved over. So, that’s created a scarcity premium for all the ads. But we are seeing more and more inventory come online. And so some of the biggest content owners in the world are having to find ways to make the efficacy justify those prices instead of scarcity. And that’s part of the reason we talked about that the amazing case study with Disney, where they talked about 12x more effective as a result of using UID2 than alternative means of personalization that what is absolutely required to bridge that gap between what was coming from scarcity and now being provided via efficacy. And so of course, CTV is getting more effective. But if you don’t bring that same level of data to the upfronts, then you are going to miss out on almost half of television. So, what we have designed is an always-on forward market, which is essentially just a new version of the upfronts. But in this case, we are using technology to make it so that you can bring data to the table. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis. And when I say always on, the upfront is done once a year. You think about commodities and equities markets, those markets are on all the time. It doesn’t really make sense to only do it one week a year. And there is an opportunity for advertisers and content owners to constantly be evaluating the value of entering a commitment so that you can either get a discount or be assured that you are going to sell all of your inventory. I believe that’s going to be an important role in TV, the same – or in CTV, the same way that it was in traditional television. But we need a product that brings data to the table. Otherwise, it cannot justify the high CPMs that everyone has become accustomed to in CTV. And of course, advertisers aren’t going to pay high CPMs that the efficacy isn’t there. There is no way to bring all the best parts of digital to the table, leveraging the upfronts the way that they have existed to-date. So, we are very excited about it. We don’t think that we have to compete with anything other than a 1962 product. And because of our super low, I think we are in a really phenomenal position.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Vasily. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, can you talk about the opportunity to go direct to publishers with OpenPath and just broadly the benefits to the publisher, the advertiser and then Trade Desk as you think about measurement, targeting and economics, so kind of this broad question on basically the pitch to everybody about OpenPath? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So thanks. I really appreciate the question because I don’t know that most understand what OpenPath is. And so I appreciate the opportunity to just clarify. And so from the very beginning of the company, we have been pretty obsessed with improving the supply chain. And as I mentioned in other forums, I often look at the biggest technology companies in the world and try to study them for what they have done successfully. And I find a lot of inspiration from Amazon in this, which is just, I think as a company, one way to define their success is just they obsess over supply chains, how do we make it more effective for the end consumer. And that’s exactly the same thing that we have been doing, both with the ad tech ecosystem. There are a lot of steps between advertiser and publisher that are unnecessary at times and are in some cases, unfair or that people are taking more in fees than they are adding in value. And ultimately, that is to the detriment of us and the advertisers and agencies that we represent. Often also on the sell side and in the exchanges, there can be an auction that is unfair. I mean to some extent, that is exactly what the Department of Justice is filing suit against Google for an unfair auction dynamic. So, what we have been trying to do is to create a supply chain that is fair and transparent and competitive. We found in our discussions with publishers and content owners that often they are as frustrated as we are with the supply chain, and say, why can’t we just integrate directly. So, we made it very clear to the market, especially to SSPs that we are not interested in competing with SSPs. We are not interested in doing the yield management for publishers. But when a publisher wants to do their own yield management, we are happy to integrate with them directly so that together, we can ensure that the auction is fair and that the pipes are clean. And as a result, we also think that not only will we clean up the supply chain and make certain the fees aren’t extracted where they shouldn’t be, but we will also have greater transparency, and that will actually create better CPMs because efficacy will go up. So, this is especially important when we are talking about connected television in part because so many of the content owners have purchased SSPs, and so most of them own it. So, they have already made the decision to get in the business of yield management. So, we are extremely excited to be integrating with some of the largest. We have talked a lot about our partnership with Disney, and that’s in part because Disney, I think represents the largest amount of CTV ads anywhere on the Internet currently, meaning owned by one company. And with their commitment to both UID2, but as well as to integrating with us directly, we think that that sets the tone and the pattern from what will happen to everyone else. Of course, we have announced our partnerships on UID2 with CBS and Paramount Plus, and Disney and some of the others, but that lays groundwork for us and then continue to do the same on OpenPath. There is a long to publishers, not just in CTV, but in other channels that have also signed up with OpenPath. And we think that represents the start of a much cleaner supply chain in the open Internet. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, we saw a recent piece from the Head of Media, Bush, talking about her preferences for PMP deals within CTV versus programmatic guaranteed. She said because it helps me manage reach and freak across CTV destinations better, i.e. decisioning. But what trends are you seeing there? Are marketers shifting from programmatic guaranteed and saying we need reach and frequency control? And what’s the marketer kind of makes that step down the decisioning path, do they tend to use more of what you offer in terms of expressiveness and personalization and getting into kind of open auction environments?\\nJeff Green: First of all, thanks for the question. Second off, super impressed with how well you understand the business. That’s just implicit in the question is just a deep understanding of what’s going on in the space. You are spot on. The premise of your question is spot on, which is that inside of programmatic guarantee, you don’t have the same amount of decisioning as an advertiser. And so it means that you are often giving up your choices in terms of what you buy, and you are getting up your ability to control reach and frequency and just other things, which to me, doesn’t make a lot of sense. In equities markets, you wouldn’t necessarily just hand over all decisioning. If you are a portfolio manager, you want to make your own decisions. So, you want to decide what you are going to buy. And that’s exactly the people that we are appealing to. Those are the people you are talking about that are in highs [ph]. There are people who want to make decisions about what they are buying and selling and especially because if you are going to pay a premium, you want to make certain that you are controlling reach and frequency. And in fact, the math just doesn’t work, if you are not controlling reach and frequency, then the premium that you are paying to PMC TV is no longer justifiable. And so the math is putting decel towards using and leveraging more decisioning, but also just people wanting to be more effective, that’s the way that they had the most amount of control. And we are seeing more and more of the move towards PMCs and just anything that is fully decisioned. So, PMCs are going to present the most common way that that happens in CTVs and whether those PMCs are initiated by us or others really doesn’t matter. What is most important is that the advertisers themselves and/or their agency representing them, have a full decision in where they decide to put the ads. And when they have that, that’s where CTV is at its best. That’s where digital is at its best.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Brian. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mark Zgutowicz at The Benchmark Group.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Good morning guys. Jeff, just curious how much of your 4Q revenue you would attribute to UID2? And what do you expect that number to look like in – for the year? And then how many of the large pub UIDs that you are talking about are activated in your auction? And then separately, curious what you expect Apple will do with private related this year and what Google will do with its ID over the next, call it, 24 months and how that may impact ROEs on your data graph? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, the first part of the question is pretty hard to answer in terms of how much of it came from UID2. And that’s in part because, of course, we use UID2 that then leverages the graph. And in that graph, it’s still of cookies and lots of other identifiers that we lean on for now and in some cases, won’t be there in the future. But we of course, could deduce the same thing with just slightly lower statistical confidence and still have lots of room to provide personalization across the Internet. So, we don’t really know how it’s impacting it until it’s not there. But UID2 continues to grow at a rapid pace. And it often is the connected tissue between all of those other things. And then when you couple the fact that in Q4, only about 15% of our data – our third-party data had UIDs associated with it, and we expect that to be over 70% in the first half of this year. There will be dramatic upticks in what’s happening with UID2, and it gets rid of much of the matching problem, but we did see large upticks in the use of data in the second half of the year, largely because of UID2. So, it’s hard to quantify, but in terms of the total revenue impact. But in terms of impressions and data that are leveraging that, it’s just substantial. It’s a substantial part of our business today. So, this is a huge driver for our business now. And every day that those buy is becoming more and more of the case. I am sorry, these are being leveraged more and more as time goes on. And in fact, our OpenPath initiatives as well as our initiatives to just get closer to publishers and SSPs in 2023, the IDs and global placement IDs are being adopted around the Internet. As it relates to Google’s ID, there is a bunch of different Google IDs. Of course, there is a single sign on. Of course, there is the Android ID, which there is a lot of discussions about in the future. And then of course, there is cookies. All of those are largely in the control of Google. One thing I think Google has done well on most of these is they have given announcements and said we are going to do this years from now. And some of those dates are end of 2024. So, we are talking about 2 years from now. I think it’s reasonable to expect that part of the reason why Google is putting timelines out like that. And so that they can see what happens with things like the Department of Justice litigation, they want to see how the dust settles. And they are kind of between a rock and a hard place as it relates to protecting privacy, but also guarding against antitrust pressure. So, I actually don’t think it’s in Google’s best interest to make those all go away. What I love about and some of the things that they have said publicly on this specific issue is that they have to consider the impact on the Internet – really on the open Internet and all the publishers that they support and especially with the amount of scrutiny that they have right now on the antitrust side. I am not sure that it’s ever in their interest to see those go away from the open Internet. But I think another way to look at it is that we are just hoping that things like UID2 to go really, really well and it takes some pressure off of them. So, it sort of goes back to the one way or another, things are going to get better. And I think with the pressure that Google is facing right now, I think that’s more true than ever.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Mark. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Laura Martin at Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey there. Jeff, tactically on the DoJ, so it’s 150 pages of how Google has been abusing their clients. My question is, have all the smart clients that could leave Google already come to The Trade Desk, or do you feel that in 2023, you are going to be getting incoming calls now that their clients have read this 150 page really draconian treatment of clients. So, do you benefit from that in the near-term? And then secondly, UGC, so I agree with you on the walled gardens. You have been writing that a long time that walled gardens are losing share to the open Internet. UGC, it’s the first time I have heard you talk about that. And I guess I hadn’t thought about it because I was thinking TikTok was taking share from the two big guys, meaning YouTube and Meta. Could you go more into why you think UGC is losing share to the premium because I don’t really understand that one?\\nJeff Green: Sure. So, on the first part of the question related to the Department of Justice and their litigation against Google and will that benefit The Trade Desk and our clients coming to us as a result, I definitely think that, that will continue. As you know, we have great relationships with most of the largest advertisers in the world. So, I wouldn’t say that there are not many that are extremely large that would move over that hadn’t already done something with us. But there are some that are changing the politicians, if you will. So, meaning they are doing less with Google and doing more with us. So, I do think that there is an opportunity for that to be positive for us, but pretty early to tell. As it relates to the UGC side, so – and why I think there is a change happening with UGC and more moving to premium. Let me just explain a little bit what I think is happening with the economics. And a lot of this comes back to UID2. So, because of the pressures that are being put on identity across the Internet, there is even more premium that is heading towards connected television because it’s nearly 100% authenticated. So, because of that 100% authentication that does enable personalization that is not likely to be changed or controlled by any one company. There is enough fragmentation whether you are looking across operating systems, or whether you are looking across content owners. And of course, you have to log-in with an e-mail address almost every time to watch content. So, that enables a level of personalization and pushes people towards the open Internet. While at the same time, UGC is having more supply than ever. And with less personalization and less control coming from advertisers, there is just a more stark contrast between what’s available in CTV and what’s available in UGC. Said another way, there is finally a viable, scaled alternative to massive UGC platforms that now make it. So, it’s not quite – it doesn’t give the same luxury to be draconian in those UGC platforms as you could be elsewhere.\\nLaura Martin: Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks. And Holly, we have time for one more question.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Salmon at New Street Research.\\nDan Salmon: Hey. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me. The take rate stayed in that consistent 20% range once again, ticked down a couple – a little bit in the last couple of years, picked back up again. You have talked about the balance of large and small clients driving that in the past. Is there anything different going on there? And I would be interested to hear just a little bit more about how your JBPs, or joint business plans, compare on a take rate business and if that’s an important variable as well? Thanks guys.\\nBlake Grayson: Maybe I will take a stab, Jeff, if you want to follow-on.\\nJeff Green: Okay.\\nBlake Grayson: So right, 2022 marked I think, the ninth of the year, where we have had really consistent take rate trends. If you look at our take rate data from 2014 to 2022 over that 8-year period, I think we went up 4 years and we went down 4 years. So, it’s really been very consistently right around that 20% figure. Some years, it goes up a little bit, some years it goes down a little bit. But the real important thing to note about the take rate is that while it’s been really steady, and I said this I think on the – in the prepared remarks. We have made massive improvements for our platform, right. We are shipping new products. We are adding new features. We are innovating for customers. And we are effectively passing that surplus to them so they can create value and then grow spend with us and then spin our flywheel. And I don’t think there is any reason why that historical range changes for the near future. And we continue to expect that we will make further improvements to the platform and the data marketplace. And the focus is always about grabbing share and thinking about margin dollars, not just margin percentage. And with respect on the JBP side, there are just a lot of facets that go into that. It’s not just like a rate conversation we don’t have. So, we are incentivizing data usage. We are incentivizing the omnichannel benefit that we have as a company. And so it’s really not any type of a drag because you look at our JBP as a percentage of our spend and it’s been growing pretty nicely. And we went through a little bit of that in our Investor Day presentation in late last year.\\nJeff Green: I guess the only thing that I will add is, I just want to underline a couple of really important points here. First, our take rate has gone up 3 years of the last 6 years, and it’s gone down 3 years last 6 years, stayed pretty much the same the entire time for a publicly traded company. Important to note that during that time, of course we really shipped a lot of software. And what I have always been focused on, and we talked about this during the IPO roadshow. We wanted to make certain that we were adding to consumer surplus. I mean by consumer surplus, we mean our users so that we are giving them more and yet the price is essentially staying the same. I think we have done that over time, and that’s partly why our client retention rate has been so high and the satisfaction of our clients has been so high. We expect to continue to add to that consumer surplus that we want to make certain that our clients want to say. We believe that, that is the definition of economic sustainability to provide more value than you extract and we have been doing that over time. There is always a desire to try to figure out what are all the drivers of the take rate and what makes it go up and down. There is a lot of complex things, whether it’s about channel mix, whether it’s about geographical mix, whether it’s about size of clients, there is a whole bunch of things, also the use of data. But I think the single biggest contributor in 2022 to any change in take rate was largely just the way the data marketplace changed. And I expect changes in 2023 to continue to affect that. But we are always going to be looking for ways to keep that take rate essentially the same and increase the consumer surplus so that we spend the flywheel because at the end of the day, we are trying to grab land.\\nDan Salmon: Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you guys.\\nChris Toth: Holly, we can close the call.\\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.',\n",
       "   'Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; and Executive Vice President of Finance, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\\'s operational performance. With that, I\\'ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you\\'ve seen from our press release, we are off to a very strong start in 2023. We reported first quarter revenue of $383 million, representing growth of 21% compared with last year, again exceeding our own expectations. And has been in the case in the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We are gaining market share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Even as most brands and advertisers continue to deal with some level of uncertainty, they are increasingly shifting more of their campaign dollars to decision, data-driven opportunities, where they can have more confidence that those dollars are working as hard as possible. As a result, we are signing multiyear joint business plans, JBPs; with the leading agencies and brands, some of which represent spend projections that exceed $1 billion. From the beginning, our goal has been to align our incentives with the buy side. This continues today. Because we do not own any media and because of our unwavering commitment to the demand side, our clients trust that we represent their interest alone and we continue to innovate our platform to bring maximum value and ROI for their brand and agency campaigns. With that in mind, I\\'d like to focus my comments today on a few key areas. First, CTV; second, AI, including generative AI; third, agility; and fourth, the combination of OpenPath and identity. So first, the transformational impact of CTV. In the first quarter, video which includes CTV, was the fastest-growing channel of our business. And our CTV growth is not just here in the United States. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. As I\\'ve said before, the shift to CTV is driving significant change, not only in TV advertising but also in omnichannel advertising. In other words, our whole business. Many campaigns are now starting with high-value CTV impressions with carefully monitored reach and frequency. As part of an omnichannel campaign, these impressions are then followed up with less expensive display, audio, mobile and native ads to move the user down the funnel. The focus on the transformational nature of CTV is never more apparent than at this time of year as major networks work to sell as much of their inventory as possible in advance through the annual spring upfront process. As the upfronts kick into gear, the role of programmatic CTV advertising is increasingly top of mind for our agency and brand clients. In recent years, upfronts have been charging higher CPMs for less reach in broadcast TV which only serves to assign more clarity on the value of digital and CTV. Add to that, the current writers’ strike undoubtedly time deliberately and we expect more dollars to flow into the spot market, programmatic and decision TV. As a result, I expect CTV to play a more central role than ever in this year\\'s upfront. Rave [ph] summarized recent trends in an article a couple of weeks ago that I quote, \"Advertisers are requesting new deal terms with the major streaming TV companies ahead of this year\\'s spring ad haggle, including how brands spend through programmatic platforms.\" In some cases, brands and agencies are asking streaming publishers to let The Trade Desk be a part of the deals. The shift to decision CTV was reinforced at our recent Forward \\'23 CTV event in New York City, where most of the major streaming media companies joined us on stage to talk about how they are innovating in CTV to bring value to the world\\'s top advertisers. Paramount talked about how advertisers are incorporating data, identity and optimization into the upfronts. Disney spoke about the multiyear transition taking place in CTV, much of it hinging on advances in addressability made possible by CTV. Also at Forward \\'23, NBCU made the big announcement that they have adopted UID2. They are integrating UID2 in order to ensure a premium CTV experience with low ad loads and frequency controls for advertisers. Across the board, UID2 is accelerating as the primary currency or CTV decisioning. As we\\'ve discussed previously, biddable marketplaces are inevitable for media companies to maximize demand and compete in the CTV content arms race. This only becomes more true as the streaming wars intensify each year. By the way, this also makes integration with The Trade Desk somewhat inevitable for all major streaming platforms as they scale because they need as much demand as possible to their platforms. Even Netflix, a company who just launched their advertising business model at the end of last year, highlighted on their earnings call a few weeks ago that the ad-funded subscriber is more valuable to them than the ad-free subscriber. Hulu has said the same thing for years. Even in the early days of the market, ad-supported streaming is proving to be the most effective engine for growth and value and that is even before Netflix brings the power of identity and biddable marketplaces to the table. With a critical mass of premium CTV inventory available across a wide range of platforms, our advertising clients are eager to embrace the power of decisioning in their TV campaigns and many of them are working with us to drive new innovations in CTV to get the maximum value from their investments. Recently, we launched a new product, The TV Quality Index, or TVQI for short. It helps advertisers understand the quality of the ad experience that the consumer is having. The index analyzes consumer perceptions of different streaming platforms, ad relevance and publisher signals to ensure that each campaign targets the most relevant inventory to any specific audience group. It also helps advertisers compare the impact of premium video against the C of UGC skippable ads. One of our large independent agency clients, Tombras recently ran a campaign for one of their large global banking customers. Tombras wanted to understand how CTV could help increase brand awareness and favorability. With TV QI, Tombras was able to see where increases in the index score drove meaningfully higher brand lift. In this particular campaign, Tombras was able to drive a 22.5% lift in awareness and a 17% improvement in favorability by focusing on high scoring inventory from HBO Max and Discovery Plus based on TVQI. The TV inventory quality is particularly important to advertisers when thinking about premium CTV content compared to the user-generated video content that often characterizes walled gardens. This was a priority for Sinyi Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Taiwan for an omnichannel campaign that they recently ran on the trade desk. Sinyi wanted to boost its business by reaching more sellers and they had previously relied on social media marketing against UGC. With The Trade Desk, however, Sinyi was able to significantly expand targeted reach and improve performance with an omnichannel campaign that embrace CTV, online video and display advertising, allowing them to maximize precision and optimize frequency across all those channels at once. Sinyi onboarded their valuable first-party data, leverage UID2 to find new target audiences and use third-party behavioral data to find people interested in real estate and related topics, including consumers who had recently purchased home decoration products. With this approach, Sinyi was able to significantly expand their target audience, outperforming every one of their key KPIs. Indeed, Sinyi\\'s video advertising assets performed twice as well as their previous GC campaigns. I think it\\'s also worth noting that while we spend a lot of time talking about the transformational nature of CTV, Sinyi\\'s experience is a typical one of many of our clients. As I mentioned before, CTV is often just a starting point. Very few advertisers execute in CTV alone. Almost all of them want to bring decisioning to their TV spend so that they can be more data-driven across all advertising channels and the emergence of premium CTV inventory at scale now enables that omnichannel optimization. Next, I\\'d like to talk about artificial intelligence and our focus on innovation. AI has always been a very strategic focus of The Trade Desk and we\\'re confident that once again, we\\'re in a leading position. In our original business plan, we said that our technology had to be a fusion of human and machine. Our initial products reflected that paradigm. Humans are often best at creating hypotheses, especially about how to emotionally connect with other people, something that is key to the success of any advertising campaign. At the same time, machines can often test those hypotheses and constantly learn from new data. In 2018, AI was deployed throughout The Trade Desk product in enough places that we launched a brand that year, Koa. To our users, Koa denotes the presence of TTD\\'s proprietary AI learning technology that generates recommendations and optimizations. When we launched Koa in 2018, we used the analogy of the copilot, where our thousands of daily users are the pilots and our generative AI recommendation serve as their copilot. More and more of our users have these features turned on as a default because they know that they\\'re getting AI-driven insights and optimizations constantly applied to their campaigns. I love what the CEO of Coca-Cola said publicly after their earnings a few weeks ago. And I quote, \"Much has been said about AI and it\\'s certainly going to abate the maxim. Profound transformative technology is often overestimated in its impact in the short term and underestimated in the long term. This is going to have a profound impact, profound internally for the way our business operates but also how we engage with consumers.\" He then added, \"I think AI is going to make a huge impact in marketing.\" With that in mind, not enough has been said about what it takes to make great AI. ChatGPT is an amazing technology but its usefulness is conditioned on the quality of the dataset it is pointed at. Regurgitating bad data, bad opinions or fake news, where AI generated deep bases, for example, will be a problem that all generative AI will likely be dealing with for decades to come. We believe many of the novel AI use cases in market today will face challenges with monetization and copyright and data integrity or truth and scale. By contrast, we are so excited about our position in the advertising ecosystem when it comes to AI. We look at over 10 million ad requests every second. Those requests, in sum, represent a very robust and very unique dataset with incredible integrity. We can point generative AI at that dataset with confidence for years to come. We know that our size, our dataset size and integrity, our profitability and our team will make Koa and generative AI a promising part of our future. In the future, you\\'ll also hear us talk about other applications of AI in our business. These include generating code faster; changing the way customers understand and interact with their own data; generating new and more targeted creatives, especially for video and CTV; and using virtual assistance to shorten the learning curve that comes with the complicated world of programmatic advertising by optimizing the documentation process and making it more engaging. We\\'ll have a lot more to say about the role of AI, particularly how it is getting more distributed within our system as well as many other game-changing innovations at our Net Platform Launch event on 66 in New York. It will be the largest platform launch in our history and I even hesitate to call it an upgrade because it is so much more than that. It will encompass a new approach to collaborative innovation, breakthroughs in how we service value for advertisers and expanding accessibility as marketers of all types embrace the power of programmatic. The new release is called Koki and we look forward to sharing new product announcements new ways for partners and clients to adopt and integrate with The Trade Desk and even deeper relationships as a result. For the third topic today, I\\'d like to talk briefly about agility. In our work with the thousands of agencies and brands that utilize our platform, there has been a shift in the discussions we\\'re having over the last 12 months or so. All of our clients are cognizant of the macro market environment, whether it\\'s high interest rates or fears of recession, the stability of the banking system or ongoing supply chain issues. They are also, though, keenly aware of the role that advertising continues to play in helping them drive growth and differentiate their businesses even in times of uncertainty. Because of this, marketing leaders need to be deliberate with advertising budgets. More and more, they are looking to understand where they can shift investments and where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven to find those important opportunities to differentiate and drive growth to their business. And in that environment, the value of The Trade Desk becomes even more apparent. With us, agencies and brands can plan and optimize in real time. They can work in month-to-month increments versus a yearlong or a 6-month plan. A great example of this is FairPrice in Singapore. You may remember that FairPrice is one of our retail media partners. They are the largest grocery chain in Singapore. They are also an advertiser on our platform. Their goal was quite simple. In an increasingly competitive market, FairPrice wanted to reach new customers with a lower acquisition cost. Working with The Trade Desk, they were able to import their valuable first-party data from their loyalty program which comprises more than 2 million customers. Using UID2, they were able to do look-alike modeling to understand where additional potential customers might be targeted, potential customers who share some characteristics of their most loyal customers. And the results were very impressive. When using UID2 to execute that modeling, FairPrice\\'s acquisition cost per customer was 1/3 lower than with traditional identifiers but also with twice the scale. The same trend is happening around the world. One of the world\\'s largest CPG companies, also one of our largest clients, recently highlighted this on their earnings call. They talked about how programmatic was helping them drive significant campaign and media efficiencies, maximizing the ROI of every campaign dollar. This efficiency helped them reinvest in more media and innovation, driving competitive differentiation. The trend towards agility and flexibility plays into the strengths of The Trade Desk. In fact, I would argue that at a time when it can be harder than ever to predict macro market trends, the ability to drive a growth and competitive differentiation agenda using our platform becomes more compelling than ever and we expect this trend to continue regardless of the macro environment. More and more marketing leaders from CMOs to agency leaders, to media planners understand the power of programmatic to thoughtfully drive value. And they are leaning in, whether it\\'s in CTV, retail media, UID2 or any number of other key programmatic innovations. Finally, I\\'d like to discuss UID2 in the OpenPath. I\\'ve mentioned UID a few times on this call already but I\\'d like to touch on the progress we\\'ve made there and with OpenPath in the last few months as well. Much has been written about these innovations in recent weeks, especially about what they might mean for the evolving role of demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms. As I hope you picked up in the client stories I\\'ve shared today, UID2 is much more than a new identity alternative to cookies. It\\'s really about helping our clients drive advertising precision in a privacy-safe way across all advertising channels. As the open Internet continues to grow and evolve, it\\'s essential that we develop new identity currencies that help us preserve the vital value exchange of relevant advertising or free content. Last quarter, I said we expect 75% of the third-party data ecosystem to be activating on UID2 by the middle of the year. I\\'m proud to report today that we are now right at that level with most major third-party data providers leveraging UID2s on our platform. A growing number of publishers are also sending UID2, providing advertisers with greater insight into audience engagement and campaign performance. And as a result, ad spend is increasingly gravitating towards ad impressions that include UID2. It\\'s worth noting that, in some cases, we may see the same ad impression from up to 8 or 9 SSP supply paths on our platform. When this occurs, our clients are more likely to transact on impressions that incorporate UID2 because they have a clearer sense of exactly which audience they are reaching and how those ads are performing. A few weeks ago, for example, Unilever announced that ad impressions, including UID2, on Disney were 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than those with traditional identifiers. This is not atypical and our advertisers are willing to pay for the value of that precision. Indeed, CPMs on ad impressions containing UID2 are meaningfully higher than those without in most channels. In this way, UID2 simply helps advertisers drive as much value as possible from every advertising dollar. The same can be said of OpenPath. To begin the discussion on OpenPath, let me first remind you of what it is. OpenPath is a direct integration from our platform into publisher inventory. It provides our clients with a direct line of sight into premium inventory across channels and it provides publishers with a direct view of what advertisers are willing to pay for their impressions. In no way, shape or form is OpenPath an effort by the Trade Desk to enter the supply side of digital advertising. That is not in our interest. To explain that a bit more clearly, it\\'s worth spending a moment on some of the industry dynamics that make OpenPath compelling for our clients. OpenPath was born of an advertiser interest in having a more clear and transparent path to publisher inventory, where every participant in the supply path is contributing more value than they are extracting in fees. Advertisers have long been aware that there are quite a few hops in the advertising supply chain and neither the price nor the value of each hop has ever been completely clear. We share this concern. And in this way, OpenPath, is very consistent with our long-term commitment to make supply chain optimization and efficiency a reality. Advertisers\\' eagerness for more transparency came at a time when publishers were becoming increasingly frustrated in their ability to manage yield in the complex world of programmatic. Indeed, many of them were starting to do it themselves, with some even launching their own ad servers. And why were they frustrated? It really has a lot to do with Google\\'s dominance of the supply side and the draconian measures they\\'ve taken that hurt publisher revenues. The recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google does a remarkably thorough job of outlining these dynamics. We have long asked the supply side to do a better job of yield management. It\\'s not something we will ever do. We see the impact that Google is having and we believe DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP should have more and better competition from SSPs just as we try to provide on the demand side. But given the state of the supply chain in programmatic which is one where either companies have the power to create change and don\\'t want to or they are too small to have the power to create the change, advertisers want direct integrations and publishers are welcoming them. Many publishers representing thousands of media properties across CTV, mobile and display have already integrated with OpenPath. And our advertisers are increasingly prioritizing direct channels, where they have a clear view of value. For all of the publishers that have integrated, we have a multiple of that number going through the process of getting on board right now. So let me bring this all to a close by highlighting that our work in these areas is made possible by our focus on profitability. In the first quarter, once again, The Trade Desk generated strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain one of the very few high-growth technology companies to consistently do so year after year. Our strong profitability allows us to invest in emerging technologies such as OpenPath and UID2 and deliver them to market, even if development resources are in short supply across our clients and partners. It means we can continue to invest in innovations such as our retail media marketplace, enabling our clients to more effectively measure how specific campaigns drive in-store or online purchases. Just a couple of days ago, we announced a new retail partnership with Macy\\'s here in the United States. In Europe, we recently announced a new partnership with Ocado, a joint venture involving Marks & Spencer and one of U.K.\\'s fastest-growing grocery groups. We now work with many of the world\\'s leading retailers to activate their data for our advertisers and our clients are embracing the opportunity to apply more performance and measurement precision to their retail campaigns. In many cases, this is incremental market opportunity for us. It also means we continue to advance our industry leadership in AI which I mentioned earlier and which we will talk about more on June 6 with the launch of Kokai. Our commitment to industry-leading innovation underpins everything we do. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the market with 21% revenue growth, meaning we continue to gain market share at an impressive pace because we consistently bring innovation value to our clients every single day. The innovation acceleration in programmatic will only continue in 2023 and as more advertisers embrace breakthroughs in CTV, retail, identity and so many other areas. The Trade Desk will stay at the believing edge of this innovation curve. And in doing so, I\\'m optimistic that we will continue to outperform the market, deliver more value to our clients than we extract and gain share. As I hand over the microphone to Blake Grayson, I\\'d like to underscore an announcement that we made in our press release. I\\'m so thrilled to announce the promotion of Laura Schenkein to become our new Chief Financial Officer succeeding Blake, who will be leaving the company for a senior finance role outside of the ad tech industry. First, I\\'d like to thank Blake for the amazing contribution that he\\'s made to this company during his time here in the last few years. I can\\'t imagine having been through this with anyone else, never expected to experience the effects of the pandemic, some very difficult decisions in the middle of 2020 around resource allocation as we were looking into uncharted territories and lots of uncertainty. But I am extremely excited to announce Laura as our new CFO. Laura and I have worked together for about the last 10 years. I\\'ve seen Laura grow as a leader. I think it\\'s fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of Blake during his time here is how much he has mentored and helped Laura to grow. Laura understands our business and on a personal note because I worked with Laura for a decade. I\\'ve come to trust for strategic counsel and her recommendations. I\\'m very proud to call her my partner and our new CFO. And with that, I\\'ll hand it over to Blake to say a few words and cover our financials.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. I am immensely proud of our achievements as a company and it has been an honor to work with Jeff and the leadership team as well as so many talented individuals at The Trade Desk. I\\'m leaving for a new challenge knowing the company is well positioned for the future. Laura is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague and has my full confidence as she assumes her new role. Now on to our results; Q1 was an exceptional quarter of financial performance and execution for The Trade Desk. Q1 revenue was $383 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Our Q1 performance was bolstered by the growing trend toward unbiased, data-driven advertising on the open Internet. This shift has played to the strength of our platform as marketers become more agile and deliberate with their digital advertising. While some macro uncertainty in the market has led to relatively uneven ad budgets, we are seeing increasing numbers of marketers embrace our platform to take advantage of our flexible and data-driven approach. Our success in Q1 was demonstrated by several key achievements. Our performance in the CTV space remains robust and we continue to achieve strong momentum in retail media, further solidifying our position as a leading player in the industry. Strong growth returned to many of our key international offices. The growing adoption of UID2 by major advertisers and publishers speaks to the value that is placed on identity in the open Internet ecosystem. In addition, we deepened our partnerships with clients by expanding our joint business plans on a global level, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing outstanding value and results for our customers. In addition to strong top line performance, in Q1, we generated $109 million in adjusted EBITDA or 28% of revenue, exceeding our own expectations. As it typically occurs, when we outperform on the top line, it generally flows through to our bottom line results as it did in this quarter. This outperformance led to record free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, marking nearly $500 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis which is nearly 10x the free cash flow we generated just 3 years ago. In the current environment, our consistent ability to grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow puts us in a strong position to continue investing for growth and grabbing land while others are forced to pull back. Additionally, I am proud that our robust cash generation allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders for the first time via our share repurchase program. In Q1, growth was broad-based across channels. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected TV continued to be a core driver of our business. From a scaled channel perspective, video which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America accounted for 88% of our Q1 spend, with international representing the remaining 12%. We\\'re pleased to report that international growth slightly outpaced North America during this period, with particularly strong performance in EMEA. Our CTV business in Europe grew well into the triple digits year-over-year in Q1. While CTV growth in North Asia also showed encouraging momentum, with year-over-year CTV spend growth in both regions improving each month. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. As customers seek to optimize their ad spend, The Trade Desk is well positioned to deliver value and drive ROI as we demonstrated in late 2020. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q1 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the pandemic. Food and drink, automotive and home and garden were also among our strongest performing verticals, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses; excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q1 were $293 million, up 41% year-over-year. We continue to invest prudently in our team during the quarter to support our long-term growth objectives. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was partly due to in-person events and travel that did not take place in Q1 of the prior year as we had not yet fully resumed back to office work or in-person events. Unlike many ad-funded and technology peers, we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the past few years, maintaining a focus on profitable growth. As a result, we are well positioned to capture market share and increase spend while generating significant adjusted EBITDA. Our income tax benefit was $19 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $114 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $188 million and free cash flow was a record $177 million in Q1. DSOs exited in the quarter were 88 days and DPOs were 72 days. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In February, upon review of our capital allocation strategy, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $293 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Before I pass the microphone to Laura to cover the outlook for Q2, I\\'ll summarize by saying The Trade Desk is off to a fantastic start in 2023 with strong momentum across the business. Our robust business model and solid balance sheet have positioned us well to succeed in the current environment with powerful secular trends such as the shift from linear to CTV the growing use of data and marketing campaigns and significant long-term growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, joint business plans and gaining share in international markets, we are highly optimistic about the potential to continue growing and capturing market share in the years ahead. And with that, I\\'ll hand it over to Laura.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Blake. And thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. I\\'m incredibly excited to be taking on the CFO role starting next month. I feel fortunate to have worked with Blake these last 3.5 years. It\\'s because of his and Jeff\\'s mentorship that I feel well prepared to take the baton and build upon the strong foundation they\\'ve set for CTV\\'s future. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $452 million which would represent growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year would be about 21% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $160 million in Q2. As Jeff has outlined, with the large addressable market in front of us, we see significant growth opportunities and continue to invest thoughtfully in the business. We continue to be one of the few technology companies capable of consistently generating high top line growth, significant adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as platform renovation, customer service identity and supply chain optimization. In addition, this year, we remain focused on hiring to support future growth, although at about half the rate of 2022 as we expect our year-over-year headcount growth to continue to decelerate as we progress throughout the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let\\'s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the strong performance. And Laura, congrats to you. And Blake, all the best. I just have one question. Jeff, we\\'re hearing a lot about walled gardens starting to open up and this is something that you\\'ve talked about for a while now. Could you just talk about what you\\'re actually seeing on this front? And how you think about the benefits and the timing of benefits to Trade Desk from this move?\\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the kind words and also the question. So let me start by just restating something that I\\'ve said many times over the years. I do not believe the walled garden strategy is a good long-term strategy for anyone. That includes even the biggest, the Googles and Facebooks and Baidus, Alibabas and Tencents [ph] of the world. But it\\'s especially bad for the smaller walled gardens. And there are a lot of players that have been essentially comping the Google, Facebook playbook and creating friction to buy their inventory. And as I\\'ve said before, I think that the cracks in that strategy or in those walls show up in proportion to size and they\\'re the result of sort of economic pressure that when you have more supply than demand, you want to welcome more demand and not make it harder to buy your inventory. So it\\'s natural that in an environment where there\\'s a lot of pressure and, certainly, the advent of CTV makes, so there\\'s more options in the open Internet than there\\'s ever been before that, that puts pressure on all walled gardens but especially those that are smaller. So you might be commenting on a number of specific companies who\\'ve been more public in the market, talking about how they\\'re opening up. And they\\'re using phrases like \"We\\'re opening to other demand.\" And that\\'s very exciting for us and I do think that\\'s indicative of what\\'s to come. One thing I just want to encourage everybody to do, though, is to scrutinize the type of demand that they\\'re opening up when inventory is available in price discoverable ways, where we can bid on it and understand exactly what we\\'re bidding and not just plug into an API and transfer budgets but to actually know what we\\'re buying and do what we do in the rest of the Internet and with our core business. That is extremely exciting to us. When you can layer on top of an identity which, of course, we\\'re going to talk more about in UID undoubtedly, that also creates just opportunity for higher prices for them, more price discovery for us and that\\'s the sort of everyone wins situation. And we\\'re seeing more and more talk about moving in that direction. We\\'re seeing some movements heading in that direction. I\\'m very optimistic that, that will continue. But right now, there\\'s a lot of early discussions and that\\'s just the byproduct, I think, of just some of the economic pressures and the alternatives and also the advent and success of UID2. So all of that together, I think, is really creating yet another secular tailwind in our favor. So very excited about it and appreciate the question, Shyam. Thank you.\\nOperator: Next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Great. I\\'d also like to issue my congratulations to Laura and best wishes to Blake. My question for Jeff. There\\'s a perception that shopper marketing is just a new form of targeting. Could you express your views on this? And just how measurement in the approach to marketing efficacy has changed with this approach versus that retargeting model of the past?\\nJeffrey Green: Thank you, again, for the kind of words. And I really appreciate this question. If I do this well, I can avoid writing another offense because this is something that\\'s been on my mind for a little while. And I\\'m just -- I\\'m so glad you\\'ve asked the question. So those that have argued that shopper marketing is just a new form of retargeting don\\'t really understand the significance of what is happening in shopper marketing. So if you, first of all, sort of visualize the purchase funnel, where at the top, you\\'re creating awareness, it\\'s also where most of the surface area of the funnel is and at the bottom is where a purchase gets made. Retargeting is a small sliver in the middle of that purchase funnel, where somebody has expressed interest with the shopping cart. They filled it out but then they didn\\'t actually purchase. And so then you -- if you do it badly, the way often our industry does, you just harass the person until they buy it. If you do it well, then you do that in a metered approach. But it is just a small sliver of the marketing budget that is spent to get the customers that almost got to the finish line but didn\\'t. Shopper marketing is the entire funnel. It is a new segment that widens the entire funnel, where, first of all, you\\'re able to measure all the way to the very bottom of the funnel. So you\\'re able to see who actually went to Walmart and bought the razor. And if they did buy the razor, now it can look alike model and go find 100,000 people that look just like them. And then I go create new awareness and I move them down the funnel. Will retargeting be a part of that? Of course, just like all the other effective parts of the purchase funnel. But the real beauty of shopper marketing is that you\\'re creating new look-alike modeling at the very top of the funnel to find 100,000 people or more. They just like the people that bought the product and then you\\'re able to measure all the way down to the bond and say these are the people that actually bought the product. And that last piece that has been missing, there\\'s been a whole lung of proxy metrics and measurement that has been used to argue, especially from walled gardens that they\\'re the ones that have driven all the sales and this is really the first and very best way at scale to say we\\'re selling product that is directly related to the marketing that we\\'ve been doing before. So if you\\'re anything that sells product in brick-and-mortar and I don\\'t want to suggest that it\\'s isolated to brick-and-mortar, it\\'s not, you can do the exact same thing online but there\\'s just such a strategic pressure on those that are in brick-and-mortar. When you think about, for instance, Walmart or Target, we were both partners, of course, trying to compete with Amazon, that the way that they leverage their strengths in being a brick-and-mortar, where Amazon mostly isn\\'t, is for them to see how they can take off-line measurement and apply it to online marketing and complete the entire purchase funnel and quite literally widen that purchase funnel. Lastly, I just want to underscore that in a very short amount of time, this has been -- this has become a big part of our business, not only does it widen the TAM but we just have amazing success stories with Walmart and Target and Walgreens and Albertsons and Kroger and then so many others, the flyboys, the boots, so many others around the world. But I\\'m very excited about our most recent announcement just a few days ago with Macy\\'s, where so much of what we\\'ve been doing is in grocery stores and convenience stores and those types, albeit all over the world, including like the GoJets of Indonesia and just so many others. But Macy\\'s is the first time that we\\'re really getting into more clothing and fashion and a totally different part of the economy and we expect that partnership to continue to pay dividends for years to come; so very excited about it. I really appreciate the question because it is so much more than simply retargeting, so I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. Thanks for saving me.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Wanted to ask a question about OpenPath and SPO. When I read the industry blogs and press. It seems like the peering DSPs and SSPs against each other\\'s competitors. There is a narrative we talk about each player trying to disentimidiate and charge the other players. So it seems very hostile environment in the industry right now according to the industry press. So Jeff, could you provide us your view on what really is going on there and where we\\'re going with respect to supply chain optimization here?\\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. Thank you for the question. It\\'s funny. The last one I said, thanks for saying in Open, almost done with the open in this one which will come out early next week on the current. But I really appreciate the question because I do feel like there\\'s a phenomenon here that feels a little bit like reality TV or something, where there\\'s just so much effort to create drama in our space including in places where there is in drama, that I appreciate the chance to clarify. So let me just reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks. OpenPath is a product that directly integrates with publishers and content owners so that they can see the demand that we\\'re bringing. It is not us getting into yield management, where we\\'re providing the service to publishers and content owners to get them the highest CPM possible. Because for the most part, we\\'re trying to get lower CPMs on behalf of buyers. They want the best value which is they want something that\\'s going to perform and give them great brand equity but they want to pay as little as they have to, to get that. That\\'s for the most part, the exact opposite of what publishers want. So we can\\'t play both sides without creating the conflict of interest that we\\'re extremely critical of in walled garden. So we wouldn\\'t sign up to go do that, given how public we are in our criticisms of those that try. And so -- but I will say that the supply chain of digital advertising is extremely convoluted and there\\'s lots of inefficiencies and complexity. I think it\\'s one of the most complicated supply chain of any scaled market in the world. And I do believe that it\\'s impossible to talk about this topic without talking about Google because they often sit in the middle, largely because of the technology that was formerly called DFP that now is part of GAM, Google Ad Manager. That, according to the Department of Justice lawsuit, has almost 90% market share. So when they have that sort of market share and they have a business model that is deliberately opaque, it becomes very difficult to see what everyone else is doing. So there are a number of initiatives to create greater transparency. You\\'ve heard about a clear line from Magnite potentially. You\\'ve heard about a new product Pelotenticate from Pragmatic. But really, what everybody is trying to do is create clearer supply chains and make it so that there are less hoops and duplication, that every single impression is running through. When I say everyone is trying to do that, I think those that are being loudest and those that are biggest. There are, of course, players in the supply chain that are trying to exploit the opaqueness and there are small players and big players trying to do that. And so what OpenPath does is it creates a baseline to compare all those against. Over time, we\\'ll continue to make certain that we don\\'t spend on paths that are less efficient and OpenPath gives us that benchmark or that baseline to make certain that we don\\'t do that. And we think, over time, those that are trying to do the right thing and create a more effective supply chain, they\\'re going to be rewarded by our efforts and their efforts to be more transparent and more open about what we\\'re buying and selling. But this is not us trying to compete with the sell side. This is not us declaring more on the sell side. We are declaring more on inefficiency. We are declaring more on those players that are trying to do the wrong thing. And honestly, it\\'s hard on some days to tell who\\'s trying to do the right thing and who\\'s doing the wrong thing. So we just developed the technology that exposes the math that makes certain that price discovery wins, that make certain that people are passing the metadata so the price discovery can actually happen. Because on a significant amount of impressions, it doesn\\'t. And over time, you\\'re going to see us just continue to reward those players that enable price discovery and punish those that don\\'t as it relates to where we take our business. But I expect the supply chain to continue to get more effective. OpenPath is a critical part of that. We\\'re excited to have the support of most of the scaled, open Internet ad tech. And every now and again, there\\'s something critical written in the press. And honestly, I think that\\'s often them looking for drama. And I think they\\'ve learned over time that if you write something about The Trade Desk, you get clicks. But that\\'s different than what\\'s actually happening sometimes.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist.\\nYoussef Squali: And congrats on the solid quarter. Blake, best of luck. And Laura, congrats on the new assignment. So Jeff, on AI, I think we can all see the potential impacts on content creation, ad copy, A/B testing, et cetera, et cetera. I\\'d love to hear your thought as to how AI is likely to potentially impact the competitive landscape within your industry. Does that give a potentially competitive advantage to those that have been investing in the technology maybe a little longer than others? And how are you guys, in particular, how is Trade Desk kind of inserting more and more of the new capabilities into your product road map?\\nJeffrey Green: Amazing. First of all, thank you so much for the question. If I could have chosen the questions today, I probably would have chosen those similar to this, I probably would have moved AI actually up. I\\'m almost shocked that we got through 3 questions without talking about AI, so I\\'m so excited to talk about it. I\\'ve never seen a topic that is so hot or hotter than what AI is right now, not cloud, not blockchain. I don\\'t even know that dot-com 20 years ago was hotter than AI is right now. So I\\'m excited that we\\'re talking about it but this is not a new topic for us. So first of all, when we first wrote our business plan, we talked about how this was the fusion of man and machine. And the analogy that we used in the very beginning was that a pilot and copilot, where human beings are often good at creating hypotheses and especially given that we operate in an industry that is about essentially predicting and influencing human behavior but there is always an opportunity for human beings to create the emotional and make it an emotional appeal. But after you do that, there, of course, is a role for machines to play. And following the data and learning, revising those hypotheses and iterating, testing blue creative versus the red creative. And of course, blue and red in terms of the different types of creative have evolved into all different types of generative AI, where creatives can do a whole bunch of different things. There\\'s so much opportunity for AI to play a significant role. You may also recall that when we launched a new product in 2018 that we call it Koa and it was our AI solution that helped advertisers to optimize campaigns on our platform. We -- in fact, they use the analogy of copilot which, of course, Microsoft is using today as their analogy to help engineers write code which incidentally, I think, is one of the most interesting ways that people are actually monetizing AI. Almost all the discussion about generative AI is on things that I think are going to have difficulty in actually monetizing. The copilot of Microsoft, I think, is an opportunity to actually monetize and I think it will help our team write code faster. But there is a couple of things that I just want to highlight but I do not believe are happening in a public discussion adequately today. The first is there\\'s this mindset of winner take all and that there\\'s Google versus Microsoft way of looking at things and I just don\\'t think that\\'s the right paradigm. I think we should look at AI like very expensive code. It is expensive to write and it is very expensive to process. It takes more compute power. And because the reason it\\'s more expensive to write is partly because of how complicated it is and the implications, especially of generative AI. So because it\\'s very expensive to both write and to execute, it is an opportunity for bigger companies or at least those that are profitable to do very well. And the fact that we have been operating so profitably for so long puts us in an amazing position. Additionally, there is this topic of the quality of our data sets. And I just want to remind everybody that the Internet has been struggling for a very long time with the concept of truth. Think back to like social networks in the last election cycle and how much discussion was spent on fake news and all these topics that really center around truth. Now that you\\'re able to crawl so much of the Internet to generate essentially artificially intelligence-driven opinions. It is very difficult to figure out what is true. It\\'s even harder than before and I wouldn\\'t say that the Internet did a phenomenal job before. So now of where we\\'re all sitting is we\\'re looking at the datasets that we rely on and say how good are they because the AI will never be better than the quality of our data sets and that is the reason why I think we are in a phenomenal position because so much of the data that we\\'re looking at is, number one, something that we get directly from the data source itself. So we\\'re listening to every ad request on the open Internet. And from that, we have essentially a pure dataset that we can reach conclusions on. We\\'re not scraping user-generated content. We\\'re not scraping the comments section of every website on the Internet, where there\\'s just tons of falsehoods and inaccuracies. We are looking at what people actually read, what they actually listen to, what they actually are interested in and we\\'re able to create conclusions and pair them with UID and have massive datasets that we then can use to make more informed decisions. That creates opportunity for us to play a huge role in the future of AI in advertising. And just to rattle off a few ways that, that can have -- can play a role in our business. We can have an AI assistant for traders and essentially create a better ability to talk to the data. We can automate the building of ad groups and campaigns to find the audiences to make recommendations. We can do a better job of creating not just internal information-seeking, where you write a search query. Although we can, of course, make it easier to query but we can also do a more personal job of summarizing that. And maybe the thing that I\\'m most excited about is a creative generation, where we can create more variety but also we can make it really easy to create, add especially for video and CTV, for medium and even smaller businesses that I think can lower the barrier to entry for us to move from not just the biggest advertisers in the world but to many, many others, where the friction can be reduced. Those are just a couple of ways that I think AI is going to play a substantial role. I\\'d just remind everybody that Thomas that I quoted from the CEO of Coca-Cola in the prepared remarks. I think that captures very well and just another opinion that I have on the topic. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we\\'re thinking about this so much, why we have been investing really from the very beginning, why we launched Koa in 2018 and why we continue to iterate on it. Thanks so much for the question.\\nOperator: Next, we have Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Jeff, I\\'ll ask one. How are you thinking about the benefits to advertisers from using Trade Desk offering for connected TV PMP or kind of like the upfront product versus what the SSPs are pitching? Is there kind of PMP but they\\'re their kind of direct product? And then kind of what the downside risk would be to the publisher from either solution?\\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So there is this opportunity for buyers to look across all reach and frequency and all the different places that they buy and summarize that all in one place and that is one of the benefits that the Trade Desk brings to the table, is that people tend to come to us and say, \"I need to have a holistic view.\" And because CTV in particular, is fragmented, as I\\'ve said before, perfectly, meaning that it\\'s not too small that there\\'s millions of websites, we have dozens of outlets but it\\'s not too aggregated so that we only have one place to buy which is not that dissimilar from what search is, where you buy from one place or what much of social is. So by having it fragmented, that makes it so needing somebody to look across, everything becomes very important. Now in the cases where you\\'re buying programmatic guarantees or you\\'re buying at a fixed rate and you\\'re not controlling frequency across all these different things, then you lose a lot of the benefits of programmatic. And in fact, you lose decisioning. So what is sometimes happening is people are buying at a fixed rate. They\\'re going to the seller and saying, \"Hey, in the short term, I don\\'t need to control reach and frequency. I don\\'t even care about decisioning. I\\'ll let you, the seller, decide which impressions I get. I just need to move this over from broadcast or traditional television into the digital ecosystem.\" And in that, given that you\\'ve sort of weakened the value proposition of programmatic, it is a bit of a jump haul. You could do that with an SSP or a DSP because you\\'ve gotten rid of all the benefits or the best benefits of programmatic. So that\\'s where others are stepping up and saying, \"If you want to, you can temporarily use us to buy directly.\" But even if you listen or read closely in, for instance, what Comac [ph] announced in the last couple of days, authorize the same, while people are just moving dollars over, we want to help them move them over. But we do believe that in the medium and long term, this will be very good for DSPs. And what they\\'re acknowledging is that as soon as somebody wants to be holistic about the buy and they want to compare this buy to something else, that they have to use a DSP in order to do that. And so because we\\'re so convinced that the very best of programmatic and really what\\'s in the best interest of buyers is for them to participate in decisioning, not to give that away to the sell side but for them to participate in decisioning. And while sometimes that means they have to pay a little bit more, including to us, that decisioning and what we bring to the table is always worth it. And so it\\'s because of that belief that I believe that the SSPs are highlighting that in the medium and long term, the buyers are going to gravitate to the places where they have decisioning. But in the short term, when people are just trying to move over from essentially an insertion order and not control any amount of decisioning and just do so with sort of dumb pipes, that can be done with us over somebody else. Advantage to do it with somebody else, it is they might be able to save a point or 2. Advantage is doing it with us is they\\'ll have a more holistic view. But we think both medium and long term, they\\'re going to end up going to a place where they can decision holistically. And we think that means they end up with us, especially in the world of CTV.\\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\\nTim Nollen: I\\'ve got a CTV-related question as well. I was listening to the Disney call just before your call started here. And Bob Iger said some very interesting things related to CTV and programmatic, I mean, including saying that they\\'ve added 1,000 new advertisers using programmatic. 1/3 of them are -- 1/3 of advertisers are trying programmatic. They\\'re talking about their pricing tiers, seeing the value of programmatic ads in driving advertising revenue for them for their ad-supported tier and so on. My question then is, given the Forward market event that you had a month or 2 ago and the talk -- the conversations you\\'ve had, Jeff, with both sides, maybe if you could just give us a bit of insight into how you\\'re working with -- is it Disney? Or if you don\\'t want to talk about Disney, specifically other network groups as to how to get them to offer more of their ad inventory inhabitable format, not just doing the insertion orders and if this is something that you\\'re participating in actively in the upfront market which is due to start next week.\\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. I really appreciate the question and I heard some of those remarks before I jumped over, of course, to focusing on ours and we\\'re very excited by the remarks that Bob made. Let me first just say I\\'m so proud of our partnership with Disney and what we\\'ve done there. I\\'m also excited about the fact that both Paramount and MBC announced their adoption of UID2 in Q1. So as it relates to all the major content owners in the United States, everyone now has spoken publicly about their adoption of UID2. And I think all of this, whether Bob\\'s comments or the adoption of UID2, is a commentary on the state of streaming competition. So -- and actually, the numbers with Disney are also a commentary on that. They\\'re trying to grow but also be profitable and there\\'s a lot of pressure on the current environment and on cost. So what that means is that people need to do more with less. And especially the content owners, they need higher CPMs so that they can fund all the content and make the same money that they\\'ve been making as people continue to make more and more content and the market gets more competitive. The only way to do that is to make the ads more relevant and more effective for the advertisers. The only way to do that is to leverage same-site UID and transparency and biddable marketplaces so that we can participate and get that increased value. What we\\'re most excited about is all of these are moving more towards biddable. So in light of what we just said in the last question when we were talking about how -- when people don\\'t want decisioning, then they can use dumb pipes to execute that. That\\'s not in anyone\\'s best interest long term because advertisers need efficacy, the publishers need higher CPMs. The only way that, that works is in a highly-decision, highly data-driven biddable marketplace. And that means that everybody is moving into a biddable environment. When we look at all the things that we talked about in our Forward \\'23 event as well as we look at what\\'s happening going into the upfront and honestly, the fact that the upfronts are -- sort of have this cloud over their heads of the writers’ strike, I actually think helps us and connected TV because that amount of uncertainty makes it so that people are more likely to say, \"You know what, I\\'ll just buy it in the spot market.\" And the spot market is programmatic. And that\\'s great for everybody, to be honest, because it means a biddable data-driven ecosystem. But what the themes that we keep hearing is that, they want the ability to activate their data. I mean advertisers want the ability to excite their data. We\\'re seeing them buy on value more and more and not on price and that often means that they\\'re willing to pay a premium for decisioning. In fact, in our Forward event in from Hershey\\'s, I think articulated this about as well as anybody can. And in this economic environment, we\\'re seeing more and more people gravitate towards flexibility and having the ability to adjust. And when you add that cloud of the writers’ strike, you also add just economic uncertainty. And then you, of course, add in biddable, you have the ability to bring data to the equation, that makes it so that everybody is looking more and more to programmatic as its future. And I think when Bob Iger underlines that, I think it becomes easier for everybody to believe that in the marketplace. So I was excited by his comments. I appreciate your question.\\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Cost [ph] with Morgan Stanley.\\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chloe [ph] on for Matt. Just as we think about OpEx leverage throughout the year, are there any areas that you would call out in the second quarter and going forward, where you\\'re looking potentially to gain a little bit of leverage in the model? And then second, on the key investment priorities, it sounds like you have so many exciting products and so many moving parts between CTV, the retail media opportunity, UID2, OpenPath, like there\\'s a lot to unpack there that you\\'re focused on. But what do you think is going to contribute most significantly to growth this year? What are you prioritizing? And then what\\'s a little bit more of a longer-term project?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So on the OpEx, I\\'m going to ask Laura and take the first part of it and then I\\'ll add a little color on that and then I\\'ll also talk about the investment opportunities or feel free to chime in on both.\\nLaura Schenkein: Absolutely. Thank you, Chloe, for the question. When we look at the big picture for Q2 and the rest of 2023, we\\'re excited. We have a great luxury. We\\'re high growth. We\\'ve got profitability and we\\'ve got cash flow. I\\'m proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments over the past few years as it\\'s really paid off. Unlike many of our ad-funded peers and other high-growth tech companies, we\\'ve responsibly managed our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. And since our revenue is still growing well in the double digits while others are contracting or in the low single digits, we intend to and can stay the course and grab share even while our peers are pulling back. So we do expect for 2023 that our operating expenses will increase year-over-year both with and without stock-based compensation and we continue to be extremely deliberate in our investments and our hiring. So our headcount will grow this year but roughly half the rate as it did last year which sets us up nicely for the rest of the year and for 2024. And on the second part of the question, we still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV, data and retail media. So as we\\'ve seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops through to the bottom line. We saw that in Q1. And we are comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about growth this year and say that, especially as we think about significant tailwinds in 2023, that set The Trade Desk apart from other companies and that can help offset anything we see in the macro environment. And by that, I\\'m talking about a strong GBP pipeline which bodes very well for future growth. CTV as a channel continues to grow incredibly fast. And in the big picture, we still have a relatively small amount of share and lots of room to grow. And then as we\\'ve been talking about retail media, we\\'re really just scratching the surface of a $100 billion plus incremental TAM opportunity and all of that makes us extremely excited. Jeff, I don\\'t know if there\\'s anything you would add.\\nJeffrey Green: That was amazing. Very impressive, Laura. Thank you. I don\\'t have anything to add on the OpEx. On the investment side, I\\'ll just add, let me first just say I am so excited about the moment that we\\'re in right now in the ecosystem as well as just all the macro conditions that sort of frame this moment for us. And I recognize that there\\'s lots of uncertainty and managing that day to day isn\\'t always fun. But overall, it just creates this amazing opportunity for us and I just want to explain why. So first, we have an opportunity to continue to invest in our people and to grow our culture. So during the pandemic, managing our team and preserving our culture was really hard. Everybody was remote and things like that. It\\'s just -- it was very difficult, in part because of the decisions that Blake and I made to make certain that we didn\\'t invest too aggressively. We were -- we never had to do a layoff. We never had to hit the brakes too hard. And now we\\'re in a moment where we get to continue to hire and he\\'s really set things up well for me and Laura to continue on that path. We are hiring today. And unlike 1.5 years ago, where we were competing with every other company seemingly in the world, especially in Silicon Valley, now we\\'re hiring from those companies and we\\'re not competing with them at all. And so we\\'re able to very carefully choose people because we were one of the first to come back to the office. We were -- we have a culture that\\'s really well intact and we\\'re hiring into that and that allows us to grow. And when you\\'re trying to hire engineers, especially when there\\'s this opportunity to invest like in AI, this environment and this backdrop and our history makes it an amazing time and place to invest in people. As you know, just from knowing our financials at all, like that is our biggest investment, is in our people and it is also our greatest asset no matter what the numbers say. Also I\\'ll just say, of course, we\\'re going to continue to invest in CTV. This is the biggest secular tailwind we may ever see in this company\\'s history. I didn\\'t know that another one would come along when we ran into shopper marketing. Of course, there\\'s an opportunity for us to invest in the forward market which really has a lot to do with CTV. Of course, we\\'re going to keep investing in UID2 and that is going to continue to pay dividends for as far as we can see into the future. And of course, when you have a strong balance sheet like ours, you get to invest in things like AI but you also get to investment in things like a stock repurchase which we started to execute on but there\\'s more opportunity for us to do going forward; so -- just so many places for us to continue to invest. Those are some of the highlights. I\\'m sure I left off a dozen or more.\\nChris Toth: John, you can close out the call.\\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\\'s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.',\n",
       "   'Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth . Please proceed. Chris Toth. Please proceed.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green.: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you’ve seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the second quarter. We reported revenue of $464 million growing 23% compared with last year. This also represents an acceleration in our growth rate compared with the first quarter. And just like the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. What’s particularly notable about our performance is that most advertisers are still dealing with some degree of uncertainty in their business. Even though certain macro indicators are improving, there’s still a sense from many advertisers that we are in an unpredictable environment. For them, it’s hard to dismiss what we’ve been through over the last 2 to 3 years with the global pandemic, rampant inflation, supply chain crises and banking system uncertainty, and of course, global rebalancing. None of these market dynamics have been very predictable the last few years. And this year, like the last few, has similarly had lots of never-before macro events. So while many indicators and advertiser sentiments are improving, there’s also a sense that it’s more difficult than ever to predict what’s coming next. But in this environment, marketers have learned that data-driven precision can bring a sense of certainty and reliability to their advertising efforts. Because of the innovations we brought to market in areas such as retail media, CTV, identity and data, advertisers have a clearer sense than ever of the performance and impact of their ad campaigns. And with Kokai, we are delivering even more innovation, all in service of helping advertisers drive precision, relevance and certainty in everything they do. As a result, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans, or JBPs, with leading agencies and brands representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. Our relative outperformance over the last few quarters means we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company’s history. Advertisers have become more deliberate with their spend and have increasingly gravitated to our platform and as they understand more about the power of programmatic, they are choosing the objectivity and performance of our platform over the murkiness of walled gardens more than ever before. Even as we continue to grow and scale around the world, we see no deviation from our 95%-plus retention rate. Our clients rely on us more and more. I was at the Cannes Advertising Festival a few weeks ago, and I could have filled my calendar several times over with brand CMOs, agency leaders and CEOs of our key partners, all of whom want to understand how we can work more closely together. Every year, demand for the value that we deliver continues to grow. Perhaps what’s most interesting right now is how marketers are seeking a sense of certainty in an uncertain environment. Much of the product rollouts and partnership growth we’ve seen this year is because we’re giving our clients certainty and reliability that they can’t get elsewhere. This shows up all over our client base and all over our platform, but I’d like to talk today about a few places where the certainty and reliability is really driving our relative outperformance particularly in retail media, CTV and identity. By discussing these 3, I believe it will provide some insight as to why we continue to outperform the market, why I believe we’ll continue to outperform the market and why we continue to invest in our platform with all the innovations coming from Kokai. So first, let me talk about retail media, which has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business. Much like CTV, our rapid growth in retail media starts with our focus on objectivity. Retailers know we’re only here to serve advertisers and to drive more precision and efficacy in ad campaigns. We don’t compete with them. And like all of our partners, retailers know, we are careful and objective stewards of their data. As you know, Walmart was one of the first early major retailers to understand the power of their data and to help advertisers understand and measure the connection between campaign spend and actual consumer purchases. For many advertisers, there’s no clear measurement of performance than that. You can look at all kinds of traditional marketing KPIs, but there’s nothing more powerful than knowing that a consumer bought your product because of the ad you serve and then using that data to improve marketing spend in the future. One of the great recent examples of this is Fruit of the Loom, working with our agency, GSD&M, Fruit of the Loom wanted to reach new and existing customers to increase sales with a back-to-school promotion. They were targeting a 200% return on ad spend, or ROAS, working with the Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk, they were able to predict audiences with much more precision and were able to understand in real time, how ads in different channels were performing. They could then shift campaign dollars to those channels that were actually driving consumer purchases. This clear line of sight helps Fruit of the Loom vastly exceed their campaign goals, delivering a 1,200% return on ad spend among existing customers and more than 1,000% ROAS with new customers. Eric Mahoney is Fruit of the Loom’s Digital Marketing Manager. He said, and I quote, historically, we’ve done a really good job of reaching our brand purchasers. But working with the Walmart DSP allowed us to reach that new consumer through predictive audience segments. We could not have achieved these results without Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk.\" He also said that working with The Trade Desk is like putting on a fresh pair of underwear. Of all the accolades we’ve received over the years that is definitely one of my favorites ever. The gravitational pull of retail media is not limited to the U.S., retailers around the world are working with The Trade Desk in different ways to unleash the power of their data to help advertisers bring more value to their campaigns. In Singapore, we partnered with FairPrice, the largest grocery chain there with 570 stores serving 90% of the country’s population. One of the first brands to leverage FairPrice shopper data on our platform was Coca-Cola, who wanted to reach customers during the festive Lunar New Year season. They also wanted to be able to measure the performance of low-funnel marketing outreach across multiple channels, including OTT, audio, digital out-of-home and of course, open Internet display. The campaign tapped into FairPrice’s audience segments via our platform, targeting Fair-Price customers who had purchased Coke or other Coke products over the past 1 to 3 months. They were able to target seasonal shoppers who purchased festive products and optimize in real time to the news and lifestyle channels that delivered the best results. With their agency, EssenceMediacom, Coke was able to drive 189% uplift in sales during the campaign. They were also able to measure consumer reaction in a range of new ways, including the time it takes for a consumer to buy a product following different kinds of ad exposures, audience engagement from different channels and cart values offirst time and repeat buyers. The retail media opportunity is also growing exponentially for us in Europe. In recent quarters, we’ve talked about our partnerships with leading retailers such as Ocado and Tesco. And just a few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Europe’s largest retail group, Schwarz, which includes major brands such as Kaufland and Lidl. From an advertising perspective, retail media is something that’s really taken off over the last 2 years. It’s no coincidence that the growing interest in retail media coincides with growing advertiser focus on authenticated ad environments. With retail media, advertisers can start with precise authenticated data whether that data is based on purchase history or loyalty data. From there, the advertiser can target based on what they know and then do more accurate data-driven modeling to expand targeting segments with greater precision Some of the same dynamics are behind the rapid growth of CTV advertising. As we have all seen in recent weeks, there is a ton of focus right now on the business model of TV. What is the future of the linear TV model? And how does the TV industry create sustainable, profitable business models for streaming TV as viewers shift there in mass. I believe the answer will come in fully exploring the authenticated viewer data that sits at the core of the CTV ecosystem, which is something that today’s leading media companies are exploring. For the past couple of years, CTV has been one of our fastest-growing channels at scale. There are a range of reasons for that. Fundamentally, video remains the most effective way for brands to influence the hearts and minds of consumers. And with CTV, brands can apply data to their TV campaigns and measure with much more precision, the effectiveness of every ad dollar. And much like retail, advertisers value the authenticated audiences that come with CTV, pretty much every streaming TV viewer is logged in with an e-mail address. For advertisers, this means more certainty. It also creates a new starting point centered on data. These dual forces of retail and CTV are truly bringing the power of data-driven decisioning home for advertisers, and it is accelerating their shift to programmatic on our platform. Whereas in the early years of programmatic, we were looking to find ways to affix data to campaigns. Today, we use data as a starting point for campaigns. Instead of hunting for ad opportunities with data, The Trade Desk and marketers are starting with data to know which media opportunities we should hunt for. It’s a different dynamic and it’s one that’s become more prominent as advertisers seek more certainty in an uncertain and unpredictable environment. As I said, media companies generally understand the value of authenticated user data. And this is a major reason why the top streaming companies in the U.S. have pretty much all integrated with UID2 or are planning to. The latest was Warner Bros. Discovery, who announced at Cannes that they will integrate UID2 across all of their streaming properties, including Max and Discovery+. The broad embrace of UID2 across the CTV ecosystem has been driven in part by a key economic factor. Streaming leaders need to unleash the value of their authenticated data for advertisers in order to create as much precision and relevance as possible, thereby maximizing their CPMs. In order for the streaming business model to thrive and for media companies to keep pace in the content arms race, they need to maximize advertising revenue. As we have seen with every streaming platform launching an ad-supported service, a subscription based approach is not enough. And the only way to maximize advertising revenue is to increase precision and relevance. With UID2, the advertiser can start with authenticated data, enrich that with their own and third-party data and then where they can find the right relevant audience, they will pay a meaningfully higher price. As Tim Sims outlined during our Investor Day, where advertisers are able to bid with certainty based on relevance and precision, the value of each impression increases significantly, generally, exponentially. Ultimately, this is how we will answer some of the vexing questions that have been swirling around the TV industry recently. And while we are still in the early days of the CTV advertising revolution, I’m confident that emerging innovations on our platform, such as a forward market for CTV advertising will only accelerate advertisers’ ability and appetite to fund this amazing new golden age of TV. It’s also worth pointing out that this is an increasingly global trend. At Cannes this year, for example, we announced a new partnership with RTL, one of the largest pan-European media companies. Through this partnership, our international advertisers will have exclusive programmatic access to RTL’s addressable linear and connected TV inventory. We are starting with inventory across Germany, Spain, France and Austria with more European markets to follow soon. This represents our most significant step yet into the European CTV market. It’s also indicative of how the major European media companies are keeping pace with changing viewer preferences and advertiser demand to meet viewers where they are and where they are most leaned in. As many of you have seen, we had a lot to say about retail and CTV during our recent Kokai launch. And I’d just like to take a moment to put that in perspective. Because as advertisers increasingly prioritize CTV and retail, it’s critical that we continue to innovate in our platform so that we surface value for our users as intuitively as possible. One way Kokai accomplishes this is with a series of new indexes or benchmarks that help advertisers understand and measure performance. In the retail arena, we launched the Retail Sales Index. The RSI helps advertisers understand the impact of their retail media spend across multiple retailers at once. In this way, we are massively reducing the complexity of measuring ad campaigns that run across multiple retail data sets. Now advertisers can understand which retail environments perform better at different times, in which channels, for which kinds of creatives, all in 1 place. And in doing so, we are providing a level of objectivity and measurement from the bottom of the funnel all the way to the top, that is simply not possible within a walled garden. In addition to that, we also announced a few pioneering retailers who are making retail measurement available for free in our platform if the advertiser has activated their retail data for targeting. These retailers include Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons. This is a major step forward in bringing the full value of retail media to bear in service of greater precision and certainty. In the CTV space, we launched the TV Quality Index, or TVQI. As the CTV advertising market has multiplied in terms of inventory, there are some who would have you believe that a piece of user-generated content has the same quality in the eyes of the viewer as professionally produced content or live sports. Yes, I know there are some UGC influencers who have millions of followers that some brands may target from time to time. But that’s a very small slice of UGC. The vast bulk of it is very unattractive, and sometimes even unsafe for brand advertisers. The TVQI helps advertisers understand the value of the impressions they are buying in the context of the quality of the content those impressions are served against. The index shows that for every 10-point improvement in quality there is a 15-point improvement in conversion rates. Sometimes it’s even higher than that. And for our own campaigns for The Trade Desk, in the second quarter of this year, as we were beta testing TVQI, we found that a 19-point increase in the index score resulted in a 50-point improvement in our conversion rate. If you’re a marketing leader, these are substantial performance improvements. I mentioned those two elements of Kokai because they’re important to understand in the context of CTV and retailer as more advertisers gravitate to CTV and retail because they offer more certainty in starting advertising campaigns based on authenticated audience data, these Kokai innovations provide more certainty through the course of the campaign in terms of measurement and performance optimization. Of course, there are many other aspects of Kokai that we unveiled on 06/06, some of which are live and many of which we will be launching in the next few months. These indexes and other innovations, especially around the application of AI across our platform are helping us surface value more intuitively to advertisers. We are revamping our UX so that the campaign setup and optimization experience is even more intuitive with data next to decisions at every step. And we’re making it easier than ever for thousands of data, inventory, measurement and media partners to integrate with us. In doing so, I believe that The Trade Desk will become an essential innovation hub of the open Internet. I’d like to end on this point because I think it’s important to reiterate that there are many things we do at The Trade Desk that are not in our immediate business interest. UID2, for example, is an innovation we devised about 3 years ago and promptly gave it away to the industry. We’re seeing broad adoption across the data and inventory ecosystems of the open Internet and accelerating use by advertisers. In many ways, the industry is looking at innovations like UID2 as a core element of the flight to certainty that is driving a lot of advertiser action today. If an advertiser has certainty that they are reaching the right person across all channels, they will prioritize that ad buy. CTV and retail are major advancements in this regard, but UID2 is a major building block of this new cross-channel identity fabric too. This is particularly important as there has recently been a lot of speculation regarding the potential demise of third-party cookies in Chrome in early 2024. A lot of this speculation reminds me of the frenzy in 2017 when Safari deprecated cookies or more recently in 2021 when Apple made its IDFA changes. Each time I have stated that none of this will have a significant material effect on our business, and that was true. I’ve said many times that I’m not sure that it’s in Google’s best interest to get rid of third party cookies because of the harmful impact it will likely have on publishers that have not implemented a strong identity strategy. But while it matters a lot to many browser-based publishers, in the long run, it really doesn’t matter that much to us. Advertisers will increasingly select ad opportunities where they can act with certainty and leverage their own data. That’s why I’ve spent so much time today talking about CTV, retail and UID2 as they have become essential building blocks of the open Internet. On the supply side, we developed OpenPath, to provide our clients with a direct transparent path to inventory. This is just the latest effort by the Trade Desk to improve supply-side transparency and objectivity and we now have thousands of destinations across the open Internet, integrating with OpenPath. And when advertisers see an OpenPath channel to inventory, they are more likely to select it versus the 8 to 10 alternative paths to that same impression because there’s more certainty. And now integrating with UID2, OpenPath or any number of other innovations or offerings on our platform is easier than ever with Kokai. We believe that to truly optimize the value of the open Internet, there are many ways in which the industry needs to innovate together. So we can provide advertisers as an ecosystem with more certainty, transparency and objectivity. In recent weeks, we’ve heard even more about the alleged dubious behavior of walled gardens, whether it’s from the European Commission or independent research reports. Advertisers and media companies are increasingly aware that they need to work with technology partners who represent their interest, not conflicts of interest. As a result, advertising dollars are shifting to our platform. And we will continue to invest in our platform and push the industry to create even more value for advertisers on the open Internet. Our recent outperformance is not a temporary blip, I believe it is the start of a reassessment of the value of the Internet, particularly from an advertiser’s perspective, and I could not be more excited about the growth opportunity that is in front of us in the years ahead as a result. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. For nearly the past 10 years, I’ve experienced firsthand all of the incredible work from The Trade Desk teams around the world that produce our outstanding performance that have enabled us to manage the right balance between strong growth and significant profitability. I’m proud to present our results today and going forward. With that, on to the numbers. As you’ve seen in our results, Q2 was a strong quarter. Revenue was $464 million, representing growth of 23% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year was about 24.5% on a year-over-year basis. Visibility and advertiser sentiment continued to improve throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain share as marketers increasingly focus their investments on areas where data is deployed effectively, where AI and decisioning produce high ROI and where results are measurable and transparent. Our growth continued to be driven by the shift of budgets to connected TV and increasing use of retail data. Because of our objectivity and our connectivity to nearly every major CTV content provider, our platform is the most eligible for the tidal wave of demand as it shifts away from linear and walled gardens. In retail media, many of the largest retailers around the world are now our partners and more and more brands and agencies are taking advantage of this powerful data in their campaigns. We also continue to benefit from the trust we’ve built with our clients, launching innovative products in the interest of the demand side, paving cleaner path to supply and cultivating industry-wide support for improved identity solutions like UID2 and EUID. During the second quarter, growth was broad-based across channels, verticals and regions. CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum again in retail media as we launched integrations with more retailers and won incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q1 with notably strong performance in CTV. And with the launch of Kokai in early June, we are well positioned for the second half of the year and 2024 as visibility and advertiser sentiment improve. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $180 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout all our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. This outperformance led to free cash flow of $119 million in Q2. Our unique ability to generate meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow continues to put us in a strong position as we look ahead and invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our growth in the years to come. This is an area I’m intently focused on, making certain that our productivity and efficiency remains best-in-class as we scale as we manage both industry-leading growth and significant profitability. I believe this is a critical factor to our success in the next phase of growth. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that international Growth slightly outpaced North America for the second quarter in a row. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover. Automotive was strong once again with growth accelerating each month during the quarter due to share gains and recovery. We also saw strong performance in home and garden and food and beverage, while shopping and business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still opportunity for us to gain share in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $305 million, up 22% year-over-year. There are ample opportunities to achieve significantly more leverage within our operating expenses. However, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and grabbing land. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, included realized costs from our 2022 hiring ramp, infrastructure investments and return to office expenses. Because we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the last few years, we’re in a strong position to continue innovating for clients, growing our teams and widening the distance between us and our competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $139 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $119 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 76 days, up about 3 days from a year ago. In Q2 via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 595,000 shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $44 million. We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $485 million, which would represent growth of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $185 million in Q3. In closing, we’re extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. I’ve always seen the immense opportunity this company has. And frankly, that opportunity has never been clearer than it is today. We have a large and growing addressable market in front of us. We have a business model that’s proven to generate strong top line growth in addition to significant profitability and cash flow. With growth drivers including CTV, retail media or international business, a strong identity strategy, a 2024 U.S. election year cycle, and a significant product upgrade with Kokai, among others, we remain highly optimistic about our future as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil from SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on another strong performance. I had a 2-part question. First for Jeff, could you provide your thoughts on the macro and the current conditions and also your initial thoughts on next year, on 2024? And then Laura, can you talk about how you’re thinking about investments and expenses in the back half of this year, but also next year as well.\\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question, Shyam. I’ll go first, and then I’ll just hand it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses. So it’s not news to anybody here that the last 2 or 3 years have been a few years of uncertainty and unpredictability for most advertisers and most of the Fortune 500. As a result, I’m extremely excited by the change in sentiment that we’ve seen in Q2 and see already in Q3, where CMOs are doubling down on what’s driving growth there’s an understanding, of course, that the markets have begun to recover, and there’s more certainty than they’ve had in the past. But they’ve also come to rely on data-driven advertising during that time of uncertainty as a place for certainty and for results. So we’re seeing lots of shifts due to what they’ve experienced in the last few years in CTV. And then, of course, this massive secular tailwind that comes from retail data as well. As I’ve said before, I believe ultimately, the shape of the Internet changes dramatically as a result of CTV and retail media. And then, of course, we’ve also seen some amazing results as a result of UID2 adoption. You might have caught during the prepared remarks that Warner Bros. was kind of the last of the U.S. independent CTV players to adopt UID2. So now, in a way, UID2 has the full collection here in the United States, and that has become the common currency to monetize CTV in the ad environment. We expect that trend to continue, and we’re seeing more and more of that. For the second part of your question for me, 2024 is looking like the tidal wave of opportunity that is both daunting as well as just massive in terms of what an incredible chance this is for us to once again grab land. So let me first just talk about some of the backdrop for 2024. So there’s been a lot of pressure on Google over the last few years as it relates to antitrust as well as privacy. Of course, there’s a balance between those 2 that a few years ago, there was a lot more pressure on the privacy side of that. Today, there’s a lot more pressure on the antitrust side of that, which we think overall makes the market a bit more fair and makes it easier to predict Google’s decisions. It also makes it so that they are undoubtedly going slower and that creates opportunity for us to once again grab land. I have said over and over again that linear television is not going to be a steady decline. It ends with an explosion. It’s going to have a pretty steady, then accelerating decay. And then there’s a point where it stops being worth it for anybody to operate in the space. You’ve kind of got a glimpse of this when Bob Iger was saying 3 weeks ago on CNBC, that he’s unsure about ABC’s future and their linear business model being broken, but of course, that streaming and the studios are very important to the future of the business. That business model is really talking about legacy linear and broadcast television and that, of course, the future is streaming. That represents one of the many opportunities for us in 2024. Now as our opportunity to demonstrate the power of decisioning, which is really what our brand new product release Kokai is all about. We also have some major advances going into next year as it relates to the forward market. But when you add CTV retail media, Kokai, UID2, OpenPath, international opportunities, political, the list goes on and on. Of course, Disney announced today that they’ll roll out ad-supported models internationally for Disney+. We think that’s one of many opportunities around the world for us as it relates to CTV. So the secular tailwinds just keep piling up, but very excited about all that. I’ll turn it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thanks, Jeff, and Shyam, thanks for the question. In terms of our investments for the second half of 2023 and going into 2024, I’ll start off just the big picture and then get into the specifics of what we’re seeing. So just always remind myself that we’ve got the great luxury of high growth, profitability and cash flow. And we’ve been responsibly managing our headcount, OpEx growth and investments for many years now. So in the first half of 2023, we grew revenue in the 20% range. And we just guided to continued growth acceleration in revenue when you exclude U.S. election spend that we saw in the same period in 2022. So from my perspective, we’re in an enviable position, while many of our other peers have struggled. So when I look out at the rest of 2023, I just look at how we’re being very deliberate in our investments and in our hiring, and we still expect headcount to grow this year, but roughly at half the rate of last year, which implies around 20%. And that sets us up very nicely for 2024, just as I remind everyone that our people are our largest area of investment. We’re also investing heavily into our platform and our products, specifically in areas like CTV and our forward market product and in retail media. And as we’re doing this, we’re focusing heavily on productivity and efficiency with all of our teams from our engineering teams to our go-to-market, business, sales AM and trading teams to make sure that we believe that all of our teams are firing on all cylinders. For this year, we also expect CapEx to be lower than last year. So last year, we came in with around $80 million of investments. And I’d expect that to be around $60 million in 2023. And just a reminder, our CapEx levels include all of our AI investments, and we don’t expect any significant step-up in investments that you may have seen in some other firms. So just to sum up and as it relates to our modeling, as we’ve seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops down to the bottom line as happened in Q1 and Q2 of this year. And we’re very comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about our business for the rest of the year.\\nOperator: The next question is from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.\\nShweta Khajuria: Jeff, I have a question on cookie deprecation. So you touched on this in your prepared remarks, and there’s quite a bit of focus on it given that we are coming close to 2024 here and Google’s plan to deprecate cookies. Would love to hear your thoughts on you think the magnitude of impact on Trade Desk, in particular, why you think it’s not going to be meaningful and the overall industry, how you think about the impact? A - Jeff Green You bet. Thanks Shweta, I appreciate the question. So first, let me just say, we’ve been down this path before. So when Safari made cookies go away, there was anxiety, when GDPR first came out, there was anxiety and IDFA removal happened, there was anxiety. And in every one of those cases, our business continued to grow, and we saw very little impact, a speed bump at best. So I see this as slightly – or not slightly, exactly the same as all of those other things. But the reason for that is because a phenomenon that is just different about our business than most other businesses that are in the space. And so we look at 12 million ad opportunities every second and we choose from those 1 million or 2 million that we want to buy. If identity is removed from – instead of it being on 6 million, it’s now a 3 million, it just informs which ones we buy differently. We’re still going to buy the same amount, and we’re still going to be informed on the vast majority of those and in part because we’ve been so strong in growing CTV as well as leveraging UID2, we have an alternative in the biggest driver of our business in CTV that is present on nearly 100% of impressions, which is way better than anything in the browsing Internet world. So just to be clear, but this directly impacts is the browsing Internet world of everything that runs on top of Chrome. So now let me talk for a second about the industry and be a bit more holistic because hopefully, I’ve made my point that I don’t believe this impacts us in any meaningful way. And in fact, I think you can make the argument that it affects us in a positive way just as much as it does in a negative way just because it would be negative to all the players that are dependent on cookies and because so much of our business now is driven off of UID2 and CTV, I think you can make the argument that we would benefit from sort of hurting lots of the independent competition. It is actually for that reason that I believe it is a strategic mistake for Google to get rid of cookies. And as they’re facing more antitrust scrutiny rather than any other regulatory scrutiny, I don’t think it’s in their best interest to do, I think, because of the way that the case dates are stacking up that they won’t likely make any decisions until the end of Q1 next year. If they do make cookies go away then, I do think it will be very bad for some publishers, especially those touching journalism, that were historically print journalists, I do believe that will really have a bad effect upon them. And it won’t have a great effect on the open Internet. But I do think it will be good for us. I do think that many of the consumer data companies will actually be better off because nearly all of their data is anchored off of an e-mail address. And the way that we leverage data is just much, much better in a world built around UID2. So I do think that it would accelerate the adoption of UID2 into the browsing Internet world, not just among CTV and audio and that would ultimately be good for us, but I don’t think there would be a quick recovery for many of the web-based publishers, especially those affecting journalism. And so it will be a net negative for the open Internet, but probably a slight positive for us.\\nOperator: The next question is from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, I wanted to talk about retail media. You spoke about the success you’re having with Walmart. We know that last year, there was a group of retailers that also came online. And so question number one, how is that coming along? Should we see contribution to revenue next year from those retailers? And then given that, would you be willing to update your thoughts on your plan in retail media that you gave us at your Investor Day, last October.\\nJeff Green: You bet, thank you. So let me first explain one of the reasons why I think it’s so exciting what’s happening in shopper marketing. So of course, many retailers have been sitting on amazing data where they know what’s actually being purchased, especially for those products that you tend to buy at the store and not online so many of the products in grocery stores and pharmacies are still primarily purchased in a store rather than online. And then, of course, many of them have amazing online presences as well as, of course, brick-and-mortar off-line. So many of them are bringing their data into the ecosystem, and they’ve recognized that the way that they’ve operated in the past creates a bit of a needle in a haystack problem where you take a small amount of data and you go look in that massive ocean of 12 million ads available every single second, and you go look for the usually thousands or tens of thousands that have your data on it. And so you start with the data and you go hunting for it. Well, in this new world where things are leveraging UID from the very beginning, you get rid of the sort of 9 dominos that need to fall in the supply chain so that you can then leverage the data, but instead, you start with the data and you’re actually just looking at the opportunities that match that instead of going out and looking for opportunities in that way. So by starting with the data, you make it so that you get rid of the matching problems of cookies, and you make it so that the flywheel spin faster for all of these businesses. So they’re not just making additional money on a small amount of data, but they’re actually selling more products across their entire company. It’s actually part of the reason why I believe that the moves that were made by 3 of the most the forward-looking pioneers in the retail data space, which includes Dollar General, Albertsons and Walgreens that we’re all looking for an opportunity to do something new in data. They made their data available for free so long as people will pay to use it for targeting. So their data is available for measurement so that advertisers can, without any significant opt-in or any friction, find out where they’re selling products, and it’s their belief as well as ours that, that will make it so that people are automatically optimizing their advertising purchases to sell products in those 3 stores. If we are all proven right, we think this represents a massive change to the way people leverage data in brick-and-mortar stores and in retail. And that just will continue to accelerate this flywheel that is spinning in shopper marketing. I just want to remind everybody that shopper marketing is not just about shopper marketing itself, it is about improving the entire funnel. So every CPG has massive amount of incremental data and insight to know where to spend their money in advertising so that they are being more effective. So all of this has the sort of a flywheel effect of improving decisioning, moving more dollars to our platform, making efficacy go up across everything on our platform. And then, of course, there is an overlap between shopper marketing and CTV where they both benefit from each other, especially because in most cases, their data is anchored off of UID2, which of course, is e-mail based in both the shopper marketing world and in the CTV world. So all of that together creates just yet another amazing secular tailwind for us in shopper marketing or retail.\\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\\nMatthew Cost: Maybe just on the CTV market. When we think about what you’ve learned through the upfront, this year. How are you feeling about growth and trends in the market through the back half and into ’24? And then on a related note, if you could just give an update on the new forward market. What is the level of interest in it? And how are those conversations trending to that new product? A - Jeff Green You bet, thank you. So let me just say that I have never been more bullish on CTV than we are right now and that includes all of the major news and headlines that are contributing to the current environment. You’re seeing everyone in CTV look to add and/or enhance their ad-funded options. Nearly all of them are doubling down on the ad-funded options. So where there’s just a few years ago, there was a religion around only having subscriptions and not having ads. That’s gone, across the board. Everybody is looking to add ads and make them more effective. So the secular tailwind on our business is as great as it’s ever been because of those things. Also because there, of course, is a writers and actors strike, that makes it – so it’s much harder to sell at the upfront for all the content owners, which of course, the upfront is predominantly built for broadcast and legacy television. In order to take advantage of the very best of digital, we need a more sophisticated forward market than just the upfront, which is effectively a party where transactions are done with handshakes and very high-level data instead of the sort of precision that data-driven advertising can bring in an impression by impression and customized user by user, that environment can bring. And so our product that we have been working on literally for years on the forward market, makes it possible for people to have a much more sophisticated upfront buy. So the early phases have gone well. It is still very early phase. So I don’t expect it to see all of the fruit harvested and even in 2024, this is going to be something that we build up over the years. But I see it in the long term being a very significant portion of our business.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Jeff, I was hoping you could talk about the Kokai launch. I know it’s really early, but would love to hear feedback on just initial reaction, how it’s compared to your expectations? And just perhaps even stepping back, some of the behaviors you’re observing from this versus what you’ve seen in prior launches like Solimar and Next Wave. And as a quick follow-up for Laura. Could you talk a little bit about just linearity in June and July. There’s been a couple of prints so far this earnings season talking about a little bit more macro softness in there. So curious about any trends you’re seeing there.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks Justin for the question. I’ll take the first part and then have Laura, you take the second. So first, let me explain what Kokai is. So Kokai is a Japanese word that means open for business or open waters. And the reason why we chose that is because we believe this is a very important moment in the open Internet to make it possible for more and more companies to build to us in a variety of ways. One of them being to sell their products. So we have value-added resellers that are selling on our product all the time, whether that’s in data, whether that’s in algos, there’s a whole bunch of ways with – contextual data, so many ways. And then the other is then is advertisers, in particular, bringing their first-party data to the table. And so with those as the overarching mission, Kokai has really built in 5 major sort of categories or pieces. The first is massive improvement to the use of data so you’ll recall, we launched Galileo earlier this year, and we also announced that Kokai, the creation of a partner portal where people can integrate to onboard their first-party data. The second is the use of AI across our platform. You’ll recall that we launched AI in our platform in 2018 before it was trendy. And we called it then Koa and distributing that AI across the platform in a variety of different ways and different deep learning models so that we’re using that for very specific applications rather than trying to create one algo to rule them all, if you will, which is something we actually very – in a very disciplined way, try to avoid. So that we can create checks and balances in the way that the tech works, and we can make certain that AI is always providing improvements by essentially having A/B testing and better auditability. The third thing is measurement. So first, we improved data onboarding. Second, we improved AI distributed throughout the system. Third, we improved measurement so that we can to measure the efficacy of ads, especially using retail data. We came up with a couple of new ways of measuring, which is the Retail Sales Index, where we take a variety of different retailers and put all of their data together so that they’re way better than the sum of the parts. And then TVQI, the TV Quality Index, we’re helping advertisers see the benefit of being on premium content versus cat videos or worse that often comes from user-generated content. Then fourth, in the second half of the year, there will be a new user experience. So that’s right around the corner, of course, because we’re in the second half of the year. So very excited about what that means. I believe this is our biggest and most impressive U.S. upgrade ever, and it’s going to create better behaviors among buyers and because it comes with much better forecasting, they’ll get to see the decisions they’re making and the impact before they even run, which is new. That is something much better than what we’ve had over the last 14 years. I’m very excited about what that means. And then last but not least is integrations for better CTV measurements and performance across the board as well. So lots to be excited about, but Kokai is our biggest relief. I expect it to be our most successful, but I will say that because this requires adoption during the busiest time of the year – because this requires a change in behavior, I don’t expect there to be lots of adoption during the busiest time of the year. And so most of the benefits will be reaped in 2024 and 2025. But we’re seeing a lot of the rollout of especially the first couple that I mentioned already seeing some impact already, seeing some performance enhancements. But as we go into 2024, we expect this to once again change the way that media buying is performed. Laura, do you mind taking the second half of the question?\\nLaura Schenkein: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Justin. On linearity in June and July, we’ve seen visibility improve as the year progressed. And we continue to see improving trends throughout Q2, where we saw our revenue growth accelerate to north of 23% year-over-year from around 21% in Q1. We exited June on a great trajectory, and that’s continued so far in Q3. So we expect a strong Q3 for the same reasons that we outperformed the rest of digital advertising over the last few quarters, which is that we’re continuing to see strong growth in CTV, in retail media and in international spend, all of which have been accretive to us this year. So I believe we remain – are well positioned for the second half of 2023 and even further out as we move into 2024.\\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, we’ve seen some developments around \"premium\" marketplaces in CTV built around SSPs. As you talk with marketers, do you get a sense that some may be willing to give up some of the precision or expressiveness with which they manage their programmatic CTV budgets in exchange for a lower tax or are they really more focused on getting as precise as possible to maximize ROI?\\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me first just describe a conversation that I had with the CEO of one of the publicly traded SSPs, where we were just talking about PG, or programmatic guarantees. And just talking about how he saw things. And he and I agreed that as people are moving budgets over from traditional television or linear – they are – sorry. As they’re moving over budgets, from traditional TV or linear. They’re often looking for programmatic guarantees as a place where they’ll spend first. But as he and I both agreed, they always end with spending in decisions because decisioning is much, much better. So we’ve recently done some studies on decisioning across the platform and compared it to PG. And we found that the value of decisioning or the performance of the decisioning on a CPA basis is 5x better in general, or if you were to say it in terms of savings, it’s an 83% save in order to – in CPA costs in order to decision. So whatever incremental tax, as you put it comes, which is usually, in our case, the 20%-ish take rate, that take rate is more than justified by the power of decisioning that comes to the table. And that’s exactly why even the SSPs and their leadership are predicting that long-term things move towards decisioning, but the PG is an on-ramp. We sometimes compare it to a freeway, where it’s an on-ramp and you get on the freeway. But if you stay on the on-ramp, you’re doing it wrong. And so that’s what we see happening. That’s what we think the SSPs see happening, but there will be some moves in the very short term towards these premium PMPs that are centered around especially programmatic guarantees that long term, we think, move towards decisioning and broader data usage.\\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Salmon with New Street Research.\\nDan Salmon: I got a 2-parter here. Jeff, maybe could you give us an update on any discussions you’re having with industry bodies to act as a public administrator for UID2 in various markets? Is that still an important goal? Are you happy with existing relationships? And obviously, you’ve got a lot of private integrations you’ve done as well. And then second, you mentioned how identity is increasingly anchored by an e-mail address, yet it’s pretty clear that Apple doesn’t exactly love the use of e-mails for marketing purposes. Is that something that matters to you? Or do you feel comfortable with the level of consent that UID2 collects because Apple also seems fine when digital advertising uses consent in first-party data. Any views on that would be great.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So let me go in reverse order just because I think the significance of your comments around Apple is important. So any of us that operate in the Apple ecosystem are putting in our Apple ID, which incidentally is an e-mail address over and over and over again. In fact, we’re not even – we don’t even know why we’re putting it in most of the time. You’re asked to put it in. You say, why? And then you put it in. And then you’re asked again and then you put it in and you are asked again. Apple has used their e-mail-based identifier to provide personalization, they have updated many of the things that they said they wouldn’t do before so that they can leverage that Apple ID to provide personalization. It is exactly that, that I think provides a validation that UID2 is one of the most privacy- centric ways to provide personalization across the Internet. It’s used across many of the biggest platforms and with some of the biggest companies in the world, whether that’s at Amazon, whether that’s at Snowflake, whether that’s at Disney, there’s just hundreds of companies that are leveraging that, which of course, is based on an e-mail address not dissimilar from the massive empires at Google and Apple, which are also built around e-mail-based identifiers. So I don’t think the comparison that Apple is allergic to them is fair because their entire ecosystem is built on an e-mail-based identifier. As it relates to the public administrator of UID2. Honestly, it’s not that important. Most of our integrations are done privately. Of course, we were happy to hand it off and look for the right public administrator, as it continues to scale and as if it comes to a more pressing issue, but it hasn’t been yet. We want to make certain that somebody that is that public administrator, of course, shares the vision of protecting the open Internet. And at times is willing to stand up and do the right thing even if it’s not popular. That can be very difficult to find. And so that’s something that we’ll be very deliberate about, but it has not slowed down anything in not having that. So we’re not in any rush to change the status quo.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Zgutowicz with Benchmark.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, just regarding earlier comment you made, I was hoping to get clarification how – I think you had said UID2 benefits you more in a cookie-less world. And I’m just curious how that is because it’s predominantly used as a matching mechanism between large pubs and advertisers and that data signal isn’t sort of privy to you. So I’m trying to just understand that a bit more. And then secondly, regarding OpenPath, appears that there’s a natural hesitancy that we’re hearing among publishers, large pubs to giving you more view into their CTV inventory or autonomy per se. I’m just curious if you agree with that and how you overcome it.\\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So the reason why we benefit from cookies potentially going away in the form of UID2 is that we have been saying to advertisers, every advertiser needs to have an identity strategy. We’ve been saying to publishers, every publisher needs to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And by authentication, we mean there needs to be some way that you’re encouraging people to log in. And in the case that you have log-ins, finding some way to leverage them. Very few companies on the Internet are leveraging their log-ins to provide personalization to the level that they could be. And there certainly hasn’t been much effort to leverage those outside of their own ecosystems or to make it possible for those that are bringing advertising demand to leverage the authentication on those particular publishers. If cookies were to go away, the need for that goes up dramatically and so for many of the publishers – and we saw this with GDPR, we saw this with the IDFA movement. There are many publishers that are saying, \"oh, well, wait until I have to. I’ll wait to make changes until I have to.\" When they have to, they will make changes quickly. We saw a fire drill around GDPR among publishers, where they were very quickly working to create the right personalization again. And again, I just want to remind everybody what’s at stake here. Think of how many print journalism companies have struggled to stay in business due to the Internet. And if you take their CPMs where they get a significant amount of revenue from $5 per ad to $2 per because relevance goes down, then they no longer can stay around. And that’s why I say that cookies going away poses a threat to journalism. But that would make it so that they’re very quickly leveraging those log-ins. And when you’re saying, \"Oh, I get to see 1 out of 3 articles before I have to pay.\" I think you’ll see a lot more of authentication at the beginning of almost every website, not dissimilar from if you go to a furniture or clothing website today. The very first thing you see is type in your e-mail address, you’ll get 10% off. If you type in your e-mail address, only then will you get access to content, that will create much more authentication across the browsing web and that will make it so that UID can be end-to-end without the thinking problems that cookie has and those thinking problems going away would create a much more personalized Internet. And again, because we go from the 12 million ads available every second, down to the 1 million that we buy, if there’s identity on slightly fewer of those, or in some cases, slightly fewer, but the signal is much, much stronger and reliable, that can be an upgrade. So there’s a whole bunch of room for upgrades. As it relates to your OpenPath question, I would say I’m not really seeing the same thing that you’re describing in terms of the obstacles. There’s lots of discussion around the way that we integrate. There’s lots of discussion around priority because many of the companies that are in the ad-funded CTV space are trying to enhance their ad-funded options, and they’re working very quickly to try to enhance those. The amount of pressure on streaming companies, I would say is at an all-time high right now, to grow and to grow profitably and to fund the content. And so often, they’re looking at ways to create more efficiency and OpenPath creates a more efficient supply chain. So something where there’s a more efficient supply chain so that they take home a greater percentage of an ad dollar is a very important next step in the evolution of CTV and streaming.\\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Kelley with Stifel.\\nMark Kelley: Great. And I will stick to one since we’re over time here. But Jeff, I wanted to ask you about if you’re seeing any impact from the MediaMath bankruptcy? And any other thoughts on share gains, whether it’s from competing DSPs or Laura mentioned verticals that you think maybe you under index? Any color there would be great.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So we definitely see some impacts to our business. So let me first just say, MediaMath is essentially exponentially smaller than we are. So it’s not a huge lift, but there are definitely some benefits. One of the first places was with employees. We have a lot of respect for what they had built and they did a lot of things right. And they also had some different perspectives on some things that we did. So we’re excited to have added a few people from the MediaMath team to our company. There’s also been some cases where there’s business upper grabs. In some cases, we won that business outright. But what most advertisers do, especially those that were running anything sizable on MediaMath is they run a process. They test a variety of platforms. They put together a crawl, walk, run plans with each of them. And I think we’re benefiting from that as much as anybody in the space or in the world. But as a result of those sort of deliberate crawl, walk, run efforts, I anticipate that it will be a sort of slow increase where we’ll once again see benefits come at all different paces, but we expect to win more business as a result, especially in next year.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Mark. And John, can you please close the call out?\\nOperator: Absolutely. This concludes today’s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.+',\n",
       "   'Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\\'s operational performance. With that, I\\'ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you\\'ve seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the third quarter. We reported revenue of $493 million, growing 25% compared with last year. Our third quarter again accelerated over the second quarter as we continued to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We\\'re growing our revenues and maintaining profitability and a strong balance sheet and making large investments and, most importantly, we\\'re gaining market share as we\\'re outperforming our advertising peers, both big and small. From a global view, our industry is nearing the $1 trillion TAM we predicted when we launched as a public company 7 years ago. Inflation, a global pandemic, the streaming wars and retail media have all accelerated the expansion of that global TAM but it\\'s especially accelerated the speed of the pace setter, the U.S. market. Magna Global estimates that the overall U.S. advertising industry is growing at 5% this year and digital spend or the digital ad market pie is expected to grow by 10%. Clearly, we are significantly outperforming the rest of the advertising market. This builds on our market share gains from last year when we grew 20%-plus each quarter and our competitors were posting negative to low single-digit growth. So even with a bit more uncertainty than a usual Q4, we continue to gain significant share and we are set up exceptionally well for times of relative stability. As I often share with the teams at TTD, we got here by aligning our interest with agencies and brands, the buy side. We align our interests with them and then we obsessively innovate for them. We create more value than we extract and we operate our business with a philosophy that is people-first. Our bias is to find win-win situations in all of our partnerships and our strong alignment with our customers is the foundation of our success and that foundation has created the opportunity for us to be a leader and innovator for the open Internet. 2023 has already been the biggest year of innovation in the history of The Trade Desk. And I\\'d like to share 6 or 7 major categories of innovation and investment. The first innovation I want to highlight today is a relatively new format for partnership. Our unmatched growth rate is fueled by signing joint business plans with major brands and agencies. JVPs represent joint innovation partnerships with our clients. Agencies and brands work closely with us to pioneer new ways of thinking about data-driven advertising and they are locking in that commitment as part of these JVPs. Our largest JVP signed this year represent future annual spend of over $1 billion per partnership. Yes, multiple partnerships have multiyear partnership agreements with omnichannel plans to spend $1 billion-plus in each of them. Our strong relationships and share gains, coupled with durable EBITDA and cash generation, means we can invest in innovation in service of our clients while also maintaining strong profitability. Our innovations in 2018 and \\'19 and 2020 helped us gain share during 2020 and 2021. And that\\'s why I expect we will continue to gain share in Q4 of this year and 2024 and beyond. As a global company, in tough economic environments, we grab market share and in vibrant economic environments, we aim to lead in absolute growth. The second area of innovation I want to highlight is in AI. We\\'ve approached AI the same way we approached building the initial buying platform 14 years ago. While everyone else was on stage talking about building, we were back at the office actually building. AI has immense promise. It will change the world again. But not everyone talking about AI is delivering something real or impactful. We have been going through every part of our platform and making investments and/or plans to inject AI in the places where data sets are rich, big and high quality. Large language models, the basis of ChatGPT, aren\\'t the highest priority places for us to make investments in AI right now. Deep learning models pointed at bidding, pricing, value and ad relevance are perfect places for us to concentrate our investment in AI. All 4 categories have private betas and some of the best engineers on the world pointed at these opportunities. We\\'ve expanded Koa, our brand for AI products that we launched in 2018 and I believe this will unlock performance budgets on our platform in the years to come. We will begin to see the impact of these 2023 AI investments in 2024. When I first mentioned the massive wave of opportunity in 2019 and 2020, one of the major factors in the size of that wave was the rapidly emerging world of CTV. As we all know, the pandemic accelerated the shift to CTV from a viewer perspective. And now we\\'re at a point where more viewers are watching streaming services than traditional linear television. The global changes of 2020 and 2021 ushered in a period of innovation in CTV. As an industry and as a company, we crammed more advances into 2 years than might otherwise have been played out over a much longer period of time. Where once the industry was taking a wait-and-see approach to the emergence of streaming, suddenly everyone was innovating fast. Fortunately, we had a history of innovating ahead. With that same foresight, I believe the Walled Garden strategy will not work for most companies, if any, at end state. Competition, innovation and the benefits of globally integrated markets outweigh the benefits of draconian Walled Gardens. The surest way to prove the value of the open Internet is to continue to innovate in the third and fourth and fifth innovations that I want to talk about today: CTV, identity and retail media. Our innovations in CTV have fueled our outsized growth and made us a better partner for all of the content companies. The last few years, consumers and media companies have been in the new golden age of TV. Content companies have been competing for streaming subscriber growth which seemingly has provided the scoreboard determining winners and losers in the new digital era. That competition to win subscribers has ratcheted up content costs. Higher content costs mean raising prices or finding some way to raise revenue per user if media companies were going to continue to feed their content engines with a similar rate as before. Every premium video content company from Disney to Paramount to NBCU and Sky to Netflix have changed pricing and embraced advertising. Not all of them have yet embraced or centered around programmatic advertising but we predict they will. In order to get incremental subscribers, they can\\'t simply keep raising prices. Some consumers would rather spend a few extra minutes, considering ads they watch than pay more for subscriptions. High-priced subscriptions alone will not provide the incremental subscribers media companies need to continue growing. As recently reported by Hollywood Reporter and I quote, \"Executives at every major streaming giant with both an ad-supported and an ad-free tier, including Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCU say that the total revenue per user is higher on the ad-supported plan than it is on the ad-free plan.\" Not only do media companies generate more revenue per user within an ad-supported option but the potential for growth is much greater. Ultimately, there\\'s a limit to how much viewers will spend on subscriptions. Economic pressures on the consumer right now are increasing the appeal of a free or low-cost option that is supported by ads. However, this model is only sustainable if the ad load is significantly lower than traditional linear television. And the only way we get there is if the ads are relevant to the viewer so that the advertisers are willing to pay more for each of them. It\\'s why we work closely with the world\\'s largest streaming services to fully realize the value of that exchange. This includes freeing up competitive biddable inventory, advancing new approaches to identity, unleashing the power of first- and third-party data and, of course, the technology infrastructure to transact and measure. In CTV, we have innovated by constructing a more efficient supply chain by creating a new product, OpenPath. It celebrated its first birthday this year and has already become a gold standard of transparency and auction integrity. We\\'ve also advanced TV measurement with the launch of TV QI, the TV Quality Index, to showcase the value of premium TV content over UGC platforms like YouTube that advertise on more questionable content for brands. We believe the ads we show in CTV in 2023 are more relevant in CTV than they\\'ve ever been before in TV or premium video. As the value of these innovations has proven out in the CTV advertising market day after day, we continue to see more premium inventory flow into our platform. Disney, for example, just opened Disney+ inventory for us across Europe. More and more live sports inventory, perhaps the crown jewel for most streaming providers, is opening up for programmatic buying on our platform, with billions of avails every single week. For the first few weeks of the football season, for example, we are averaging more than 300 advertisers activating on the NBC Sunday Night Football live stream. A great example of an advertiser pioneering new approaches to TV advertising with a focus on live sports is Old Navy. They have been a long-time participant in the upfront process. With their agency, PhD, Old Navy wanted to embrace CTV as more of their target audience has shifted to streaming. At first, they moved part of their spend from insertion order to programmatic guaranteed and consolidated spend on our platform. In doing so, they were able to mitigate audience overlap across TV providers and hold each provider more accountable for performance. But as Old Navy quickly found out, programmatic guaranteed has limitations. Programmatic guaranteed, or PG, does not allow Old Navy to get the full value of programmatic such as frequency management, audience targeting and the ability to layer on their first-party data. So they took the next step in the form of decision biddable buying within the private marketplace and focused on live sports inventory. CTV live sports advertising was appealing because it offered an opportunity to expose their brand against very high premium content that might be more restrictive and expensive in a traditional linear environment. They were able to use Koa, The Trade Desk\\'s AI, to optimize pacing and frequency management across the highest-performing inventory. As a result, they saw a 70% reduction in the cost to reach each unique household versus their programmatic guaranteed performance. And we\\'re just scratching the surface. As recently reported in The Current, NBCUniversal has teamed up with the Walmart DSP which partners with The Trade Desk so brands can now deliver targeted ads on Peacock live sports inventory using Walmart shopper data. Brands can then measure and provide attribution on the results of those ads in terms of impact and in-store and online sales. So now, North America which includes brands such as Danone, Silk and Activia, reported a 30%-plus increase in new-to-brand buyers from their CTV campaign earlier this year. The next phase of innovation in CTV is the development of a forward market product on our platform. We are investing significant resources to build this product which is akin to a futures market but for premium CTV inventory. Here, we bring the best of the traditional upfront guarantee and combine it with the power of data-driven decisioning or programmatic advertising. Advertisers commit to certain levels of spend on specific audiences in a decision programmatic forward market. We are already active in live beta with a number of CTV providers and advertisers and expect the testing to steadily increase throughout 2024. We\\'re excited to provide more details on our forward market innovations at our Forward \\'24 event in the first half of next year. The advances in CTV in 2023 for The Trade Desk have been accelerated by the fourth category of innovation I want to discuss today, identity. With Google\\'s latest disclosure that they plan to deprecate cookies in 2024, the industry has been more focused than ever on coalescing around a better alternative. Nearly all of the major streaming companies in the U.S. have embraced UID2. They understand that if advertisers only advertise on users likely to be interested in their products, then advertisers will pay meaningfully more for those impressions. With UID2, content owners don\\'t have to share data. Instead, advertisers can use their own data and to do so, they\\'re willing to pay more. One leading streaming platform recently implemented UID2 and the results have been remarkable. Their average daily revenue from The Trade Desk has increased 150%. Their average daily revenue when those impressions are open and biddable, has increased 222% and all because they are able to offer advertisers a much clearer sense of relevance and addressability. Again, because of rising cost of content and less appetite from consumers to pay for more subscriptions, every global content company in the world is now rolling out a programmatic advertising strategy and plan. As a result, more and more publishers and advertisers are now deploying UID2. Over the last couple of years, a who\\'s who of major publishers, advertisers and data partners have announced their commitment to UID2 and now we\\'re seeing the positive impact of adoption on our platform. Luxury Escapes is a high-end travel agency with more than 7 million customers worldwide. They activated their first-party data on our platform and then used UID2 to help find potential new customers who shared characteristics with the most loyal customers they already had. In this way, their first-party data acted as a seed to grow their potential customer base. And the results were very impressive. In the U.S. alone, their conversion rate with UID2 was more than 400% higher than with cookies. Their return on asset was 900% higher and their cost per acquisition was 83% lower. For the first time ever, in 2024, we expect the majority of CTV and premium video impressions to be bought on our platform using either EUID or UID2. The fifth innovation I wanted to highlight today is the rapid innovating we\\'re doing in retail media and retail data partnerships. The fusion of retail and programmatic advertising has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic. Our partnerships with Walmart, Target, Albertsons, Instacart and many, many more have fueled the expansions of our TAM in the United States. Schwartz and Ocado have been notable catalysts in the EU. Incidentally, the EU programmatic advertising ecosystem is showing signs of improvement, in part brought on by the appeal of retail partnership. And lastly, BigBasket and Tokopedia are examples of growing synergies between programmatic advertising and retail media in some of the largest APAC markets. Just as stay-at-home directives encouraged many of us to shift our viewing habits to binge streaming, they also forced many of us to shift our shopping habits to e-commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales boomed 43% in 2020 alone and it has continued to grow every year since. As a result, advertising on e-commerce destinations has become more attractive and the value of data collected about purchase behaviors has become much more valuable. All major retailers are working on activating that data for advertisers, so brands can understand how their advertising dollars impact actual sales, whether online or in-store and most of them are partnering with us. The significance of this shift should not go unstated. All advertisers are focused at their core on driving sales growth. But until very recently, especially in the consumer space, advertisers have been missing the link between their advertising dollars and the real-world sales growth. Instead, they have had to use proxy metrics to showcase the ROI of their campaigns. How many click-throughs did their ads strive for example. But now we can measure with much more precision whether the ad dollars actually led to a consumer purchase. We can attribute value to all parts of the funnel, not just the last touch. We can understand the relevance of every ad impression more clearly and we can better prioritize the right channel at the right time for the right audience. The open Internet is proving to be increasingly preferred by big brands as retail media makes the efficacy of the open Internet continue to improve and scale. Rossman, a major European drugstore chain, came to us when they wanted to drive first sales for their organic food brand. They knew that if consumers tried their product, there\\'s a 95% chance of them becoming repeat customers. The challenge was getting them to make that first purchase. Working with us, they were able to deploy their first-party data and then find where their target audience groups might be across the open Internet. With data-driven precision, they were able to determine that 99% of their ad spend was hitting their specific target audience. And more major retail organizations continue to partner with us as the most effective way to enable advertisers to benefit from their data. Just last month, Instacart, one of the world\\'s largest retail technology companies representing more than 1,400 retail labels, announced that it will make its retail media data available to advertisers on The Trade Desk. At the same time, we continue to innovate in the retail space. As a part of Kokai, we have launched the Retail Sales Index which allows advertisers to understand the performance of the retail campaigns across the open Internet. It radically simplifies the measurement and attribution process in a rapidly evolving market and we are just scratching the surface. As one of the few independent players at scale in our industry, we are in the pole position to continue partnering with leading retailers, standardize their data on our platform and drive value for our clients. Let me conclude by making a few comments about the current environment and then connect the dots of innovation and our optimism for the future. We represent the vast majority of the Ad Age top 200 advertisers, the largest advertisers in the world. Starting in the second week of October, we have seen some transitory cautiousness across some of those advertisers. These include, for example, industries that have been impacted by recent strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. Through the first week of November, we have seen spend stabilize and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year and for 2024. Both CTV and retail media continued to drive our business and we continue to win share. In terms of innovation, I am so excited to showcase the strength of this company over the next few years as we\\'ve innovated and built more this year than in any year in our history, while at the same time, preserving and leaving room to expand our operating leverage. The many innovations I\\'ve discussed today are embedded in our newest version of the platform, Kokai. We\\'ve been launching Kokai innovations throughout the year but many of the biggest innovations, including our new UX, are in alphas or private betas today and will roll out to all of our customers in the first half of next year. As we exit 2023 and look forward to 2024, I want to highlight several specific areas that make me extremely positive about our future prospects. So let me sum up. First, agencies and brands are more deliberate with advertising budgets. They are shifting ad budgets to where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven in everything they do, especially in times of uncertainty and this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Second is the innovation coming from AI and the many, many opportunities we have ahead of us to find places to inject AI into what may be the most rich and underappreciated data asset on the Internet which we have here at The Trade Desk. Third, Connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business and a key driver of overall omnichannel growth and it\\'s not just here in the U.S. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. The industry is evolving fast as providers shift inventory into biddable marketplaces to maximize ad revenue and as advertisers look to bring more precision and addressability to their TV campaigns. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers in the CPG space think about measurement and attribution and our innovation is at the center of this. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last several years in our go-to-market strategy in CTV and in retail media. We believe we are in a position to continue to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth is the rapid adoption of UID2 and EUID as the currency for relevant ads and personalized content that has been adopted by the infrastructure of the Internet and nearly all of the biggest content companies in the world. Seventh is the upcoming U.S. political election. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. In 2024, we expect to gain more share in this segment and we believe that spend will increase as the year progresses. And finally, we continue to be one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that has steadily increased over the years. As a result, we have been able to invest in innovation and generate strong profitability. I believe The Trade Desk has been successful because we have always focused on delivering premium value to advertisers and agencies. Everything we do, including our latest Kokai innovations, are pointed at helping brands and advertisers get the maximum being for every advertising dollar. I could not be more confident or excited about how we are positioned for 2024 and beyond because of the many growth drivers that we\\'ve discussed today. We will continue to innovate to lead the market and I\\'m confident that the world\\'s leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. And with that, I\\'ll hand the call over to Laura, who will give you more color on the quarter.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As you have seen in our Q3 results, we have continued to execute extremely well. During the quarter, we continued to grab share and outpace our peers. We delivered accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, managed our expenses efficiently and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Our results are a reflection of the premium advertisers are placing on precision, agility and transparency as they continue to shift away from linear media and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $493 million, representing growth of 25% year-over-year, an acceleration from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year was about 27% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to win spend as marketers increasingly focus their investment on platforms that deliver value, particularly in premium video like CTV. This is a dynamic we\\'ve seen many times over the years. When the macro environment presents challenges, brands shift to platforms and channels that offer flexibility and measurable results. During the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and brought the Retail Sales Index to market. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q2 with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $200 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 40% of revenue. This led to free cash flow of $184 million in Q3, marking over $600 million of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. I\\'m proud of our ability to generate strong profitability while continuing to invest in our business as that will help fund our future growth. Because of our fortunate position within an incredibly large addressable market, one of our greatest responsibilities is ensuring that we are growing sustainably while also generating sufficient profitability and cash flow. Our team has done a remarkable job achieving this as we balance short-term opportunities with our long-term financial vision. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q3, video which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represents about 87% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 13%. We are very pleased that international growth slightly outpaced North America for the third quarter in a row. CTV across EMEA and North Asia was very strong during the quarter, growing over 100% year-over-year in each region. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, we continued to see strong performance in food and drink, travel and automotive. Health and fitness and business were below the average. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $316 million, up 29% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $18 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $167 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $192 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $184 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days, down about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1.2 million shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $90 million. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. First, we continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. That said, we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $580 million which would represent growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a mid-single-digit percent of spend in Q4 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q4 of this year would be about 22% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $270 million in Q4. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive momentum across our company priorities, achieve profitable growth and drive significant share gains. Regardless of what the macro brings, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are in today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data, our biggest product release ever with Kokai, growth in international markets, an identity framework that has never been stronger, the U.S. presidential election cycle, amongst others, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let\\'s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the strong 3Q across the board. I think the big thing on everyone\\'s mind right now is the 4Q outlook which I think caught a lot of people by surprise. Maybe we can start there. Jeff, I know you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks but can you talk a little bit more about what you\\'re seeing in 4Q? And just what gives you confidence that it is all macro and not competitive or anything else?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. And I\\'m really glad you\\'re asking this question, Shyam. So I have a lot to say on it, so I appreciate the kind words and the question. So first, just looking back, we had a very strong Q3, growing 25%, once again beating the market. And please don\\'t forget and this is really important, that we are coming off of a 30%-plus growth year from last year, where many of our competitors were shrinking or barely growing. This year and last year were years where we\\'re gaining market share at a higher rate than we have previously. This year, I think we signed more long-term JVPs with major brand advertisers and agencies than ever before with bigger amounts and longer time horizons than we\\'ve ever had before, too. So once again, this year, CTV and retail media have been leading the way and in general, we have amazing momentum going into Q4. Another reminder, we represent the Ad Age top 200 advertisers and of course, the majority of the S&P 500, something that I\\'ve pointed out many times before. These are, of course, the largest advertisers in the world. And of course, that means that we represent nearly every major sector of the economy as well. So that said, starting about the second week of October, we began to see some transitory cautiousness around certain advertisers. For example, we saw some reduction in brand spend in verticals such as automotive and consumer electronics, for instance, specifically around cell phones and media and entertainment. Some of these industries have been recently impacted by strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. So the first week in November, we have seen spend stabilize and we\\'re very confident that we will continue to outpace our industry and gain market share. Excluding election spend in Q4 of 2022, we\\'re guiding to about 22% year-over-year growth which is significantly faster than the industry and illustrates the long-term strength of our business model, especially when you consider those comps. I\\'m very proud of our team and what they\\'ve done in the first 3 quarters and the market wins that they\\'re putting on the board right now. The team really is firing on all cylinders. Our company is extremely healthy with great operating leverage and a strong balance sheet. All of those things are the strongest they\\'ve ever been. Given our strength in the fastest-growing channels of digital advertising, growing long-term relationships in the world\\'s largest brands and agencies, the technology innovations that we outlined in our prepared remarks, including Kokai and the AI investments that we\\'re making, we are very confident that we will continue to outpace the industry and gain share and I\\'m very optimistic heading into 2024. Thanks, Shyam, for the question.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannon Globe Research [ph].\\nVasily Karasyov: Obviously following up on the point of interest here, Jeff, wanted to ask you to talk in a little more detail about what you saw this quarter, specifically the linearity that we\\'ve seen in the first 5 weeks so far. And probably wanted to ask about if you could provide more color on where you have seen cautiousness on the part of advertisers. So any additional color you can give us on what\\'s going on this quarter would be appreciated.\\nJeffrey Green: Okay. Laura, I know you have some comments on this. Why don\\'t you go first, then I\\'ll go second? I\\'ll add to it.\\nLaura Schenkein: Absolutely. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So the way I view this is that coming off of a strong Q3, we continued to see that strength going into the first week of Q4. Starting in the second week is when we saw some advertisers become more cautious in their spend. And we saw this cautiousness across a few verticals that Jeff mentioned, such as automotive, consumer electronics and handsets and media and entertainment. And of course, some of the caution is transitory due to what we mentioned, the strikes in auto and in media and in entertainment. We continue, at the same time, to see strong spend in our largest drivers such as CTV and retail media. And through today which is a weekend change into November, we\\'ve seen spend stabilize so we\\'re cautiously optimistic for the remainder of Q4. Jeff, is there anything you\\'d add to that?\\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So first, a couple of things to just keep in mind. We had very strong and healthy growth every quarter for the last couple of years. We have significantly outpaced the industry and gained share. During that same time, some of our largest competitors are coming off low or negative growth from a year ago, where we\\'re coming off of over 20% growth, then an over 20% growth again. Our unparalleled growth is because we\\'ve never been closer to many of the largest brands and agencies in the world that all use our platform. We\\'re striking more and more long-term commitments in JVPs and we\\'re innovating to bring new value across all their omnichannel advertising campaigns. That includes in the biggest release that we\\'ve ever made in Kokai which of course, includes AI and performance enhancements that we\\'ve never seen before. Our business is largely based on the world\\'s largest brands. So if there is a little caution due to macro uncertainty facing everyone, we, of course, won\\'t be immune from that in the short term. But we\\'re convinced that the macro pressures today represent land grab opportunities now that will show fruit or pay off over and over again in the years to come. The fundamentals of our long-term business are as solid as they\\'ve ever been and we are poised to continue to outpace the industry and gain share in Q4 and we\\'re really positioned well to go into 2024. Thanks for the question, Vasily.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Jeff, I just wanted to build off of your last statement there. Given the caution that you\\'re seeing from advertisers right now, what gives you that confidence heading the next year around growth and market share gains in the year ahead? And just a quick follow-up to that point. Last year at the Analyst Day, you were talking about just investing to make sure you\\'re not missing this CTV and retail media wave. So I know you don\\'t guide to expenses or EBITDA for the year ahead but could you give some commentary on just how you\\'re thinking about the right level of investments in an environment like this one?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I\\'ll take the first part of the question and Laura, if you\\'ll just speak to the investment side of that question. So let me just say a few words on 2024. First, obviously, the macro environment plays a role in our business and things like higher cost of capital and increased money supply have downstream effects on most businesses. Some of those effects are opportunities which we\\'re seeing mostly across our client base but we\\'re seeing some of those effects as pressures on their businesses. But regardless of the macro environment\\'s effects on individual companies, we continue to see the tidal wave of opportunity over the next 2 years. And I\\'ve never been more bullish and that is because of just the slew of things in front of us that are -- what we see as some of the biggest opportunities we\\'ve ever seen and probably ever will. CTV is moving to streaming more and more and they\\'re also moving to biddable both as a total and as a percentage at a faster rate than it ever has before. Content has more competition than ever and it needs ads as a part of their strategies more than it ever has as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We\\'re convinced that there are incremental subscribers and the incremental revenue are largely going to come from ads. Retail media is something we didn\\'t spend as much time as I would have liked in the prepared remarks, is one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and it\\'s providing advertisers with completely new ways of thinking about measurement and attribution. It closes the loop and helps them see the impact of their advertising in a way that has never been possible before. But in addition, they\\'re also finding customers that benefit both advertisers and retailers because they\\'re selling more of their products in the retailers that they\\'re partnering with to get the data. In 2024, I also believe audio will follow suit. They\\'re going to take out the CTV playbook and they\\'re going to see some of the benefits that I think are really important for that category to grow. So I think there\\'s another secular tailwind available in 2024. Decision programmatic is poised to have its best year ever in 2024. And I believe this is partly due to the macro pressures. We\\'re investing heavily in our platform so that we make the value as obvious and as powerful as possible. I think the open Internet will start to get the first dollar even more in 2024 than it has in the past and the places where we\\'re injecting AI into the platform have seen amazing results so far. So of course, I\\'m optimistic about what that will relate to in 2024, especially because everything that we\\'ve done so far in AI has been small and yet also really impactful. So if we just continue down that track, I think we\\'re going to see some amazing fruit come from that. Incidentally, I\\'m here in Chicago today. Yesterday, I met with hundreds of our clients, hundreds of traders, hands-on keyboard people. The day before that, I met with a group about the same size in New York. We have never been more aligned with traders than we are today. I think they\\'re excited about the control and upgrades that Kokai represent for them which I believe they\\'ll all hit the ground running in Q1 with those enhancements. We\\'ve put better decisioning right next to data. We put those 2 right next to each other in a much better and usable way than we ever have before. We\\'ve made first-party data activation better than it\\'s ever been before. And that\\'s strategically more important at this moment than it\\'s ever been. The obvious benefits of UID2 and EUID are becoming more and more apparent to everybody in the advertising community. Traders know that their jobs are not going to be taken away by AI. But instead, they have to compete with each other. So their job could be taken away from a trader who knows how to use AI really well until all of them are looking at ways to use the tools that are fueled by AI that were provided, where AI is essentially doing 1 or 2 things. It\\'s either doing the math for them, if you will, of course, with very advanced learning models or, in other cases, it\\'s actually their co-pilot. So we could not be more excited. I\\'m more bullish on even things like EUID and Europe. I think many markets outside the U.S. recovered more slowly post pandemic but we\\'re seeing advertisers now in the EU start to really lean into the innovations that we\\'re bringing to the market in all dimensions such as EUID. In times of macro uncertainty or for verticals that are dealing with uncertainty, we will gain share aggressively and we\\'re seeing exactly that. In times of more stability, we accelerate our spend. But I couldn\\'t be more confident in that model and the growth potential that, that means for both the near term and the long term. Laura, for the part on expenses?\\nLaura Schenkein: Yes. So I\\'m going to repeat something I\\'ve said before which is that we have a great luxury. We\\'re high growth, we\\'re profitable. We\\'ve got cash flow. And in 2023, we\\'re growing well into the double digits above 20%. So all of that allows us to save the course to continue investing in areas such as CTV, AI or platform measurement and to still deliver that strong profitability and cash flow. So as we and you start to think about 2024 for The Trade Desk, there are a few things I keep in mind. First, we\\'ve been deliberate in our investments in hiring. So we\\'re going to grow headcount this year but only at about 15% to 17%. And importantly, we expect a similar trajectory next year which should allow us to grow headcount slower than revenue growth. That leads to a very nice setup for 2024. I\\'d also add that our investments include Kokai, AI, the forward market and we don\\'t see any material increases as others have with investments in areas like that. We\\'re also focusing heavily on productivity with our engineering teams, our go-to-market teams, everyone at sales, account management and trading. And I\\'d close with, I\\'ve been here about 10 years now and I couldn\\'t be more confident in our model, our growth, our ability to drive profitability and cash flow in both the near and the long term. Thank you for the questions.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.\\nShweta Khajuria: I have two, please. So first is on retail media. Jeff, when we think about the opportunity that Trade Desk has in retail media, if we think about, call it, 2 to 3 years from today, what would you be satisfied with in terms of how big retail media revenue is as a percentage of overall business, call it, 10%, 20%-plus? How should we think about that? And then second is on connected TV, clearly a growth driver as well. Where do you think industry growth is expected for next year and more specifically for Trade Desk to grow faster than overall industry? How should we think about what is really driving that inflection of shifting inventory to biddable marketplaces? Do we expect that next year and is that the key driver that will allow you to gain share?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So rather than giving specifics on growth rates that I expect 2 to 3 years from now, we don\\'t guide in that way, I\\'ll talk about the macro vectors that are influencing that. So what I\\'ll be happy to see over the next 2 or 3 years is to see us, first of all, continue to grow in the way that we have with companies like Walmart and Albertsons and Walgreens and Dollar General. We\\'ve had just an amazing year in all of those partnerships and so many others. I don\\'t mean to leave off the dozens of others that have been amazing partners to us this year. And once again, this is a case where economic pressures have helped them to be bold and daring and do things that they haven\\'t done before that have really paid off for them and us and our clients. And I really love it when we see win-win-win situations like that. All of those are benefiting all 3 groups: the retailer, the advertiser and us, the platform. So what I look for in the next 2 to 3 years is to see that continue and to see the trends of retailers saying, \"I want to help close the loop. I want to use my data to help the biggest brands in the world sell products in my store. I want to spend my flywheel faster,\" and we want to see more and more retailers think about their business the way that Amazon thinks about their business which is about spinning the flywheel and using data to make better decisions. If they simultaneously make that data available for measurement and attribution, it will be better for everyone, including and arguably especially, them. So we want to see them do that over the next 2 to 3 years. As it relates to CTV growth, the macro trend that I just want to point out is that, of course, as there\\'s been macro pressure put on the consumer, at the same time, we\\'ve overwhelmed the consumer with choice in the CTV world. So if you think about you as a consumer, how many more choices do you have, especially in the U.S. in streaming as compared to what you have 5 years ago. There\\'s just way more choices. It\\'s hard to keep track of which app the shows are even on. There\\'s just way more choices in terms of apps and outlets. Even though there\\'s been a little bit of lull in the content production as a result of the strikes, in terms of the apps themselves and the need for sort of this content machine to continue to grow and grow subscribers, it\\'s gone up for all of them, whether you\\'re talking about smaller players like Paramount or the big guys like Disney, who reported yesterday. All of them, in my view, need programmatic advertising to help them get the next stage of growth and that\\'s largely because they can\\'t just keep raising prices and consumers are saying, \"I want to watch it but is there any other way than having a total bill for television that is bigger than what I had back when I was paying for cable? How can I get access to all the great content and not pay quite as much?\" And what that\\'s brought all of them to, is ad-funded options. And I think companies like Disney and Netflix have proven this, where their ad-funded subscribers are worth, in most cases, about double to them what those that are not receiving ads are worth to them. The only way that, that keeps up and that they keep producing more revenue per user is if the ads get more effective and more relevant. I don\\'t think it\\'s super easy for them to just create lots more ads. I think that will be too disruptive. I know there\\'s a lot of fear of that in all the content companies. So their way out is to make CPMs go up. The only way to do that is for them to make the ads more relevant. That means they\\'ll embrace UID2, so I -- that\\'s already happened. All of them have offered public support. All of them are in the process of implementing. But the faster they implement UID2, the faster that will accelerate for them. And as we see more authentication and more options in terms of the way consumers can pay, it\\'s either through sharing a little bit more of their time to see ads or paying a bit more money, we\\'ll see more and more of them choose the ads as has historically always been the case. And as a result, that means better and bigger partnerships for us. So, I really just think we have to continue to be a great partner to the content owners and keep showing up the way that we have. But otherwise, those macro vectors are the things that are really going to drive this. Really appreciate the question.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Two questions. One, Jeff, that ties back to what you just talked about which is as linear shifts to CTV and to kind of upfront to programmatic solutions, right, it results in less waste. Although presumably, so some will have higher CPMs, right? But some of that spend will leave video and be allocated to some areas. Some of you participate in and like this quarter, your display accelerated, I think, a lot sequentially versus others who don\\'t like search and social. So just maybe talk about broadly where you\\'re helping -- you have the opportunity to help advertisers reallocate money, other places where you do participate. And then Laura, just can you talk about the swing factors that kind of go to that comment of at least for the guidance? Are you assuming that trends that have stabilized in November continue? Or does the guide kind of more assume an average, right, of like what you\\'ve seen quarter-to-date?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I appreciate the question, Jason. Of course, I\\'ll take the first part and then Laura, she\\'ll take the second part. So you\\'re right, that as money shifts from linear or traditional television into CTV, it, of course, has an opportunity to be reallocated. And whenever a CMO or a media buyer has the option to reconsider, of course, the first place where they\\'re usually looking is to do something very similar. And let\\'s not forget that television has always focused on being a top-of-the-funnel activity where you\\'re creating awareness. I would argue that\\'s where the heavy lifting of advertising is done which is the process of winning hearts and minds. Hearts and minds are not historically won in 240 blue and black characters. They are won with moving picture and audio and emotion. And that work continues to be done at the top of the funnel in CTV. So I would argue that CTV right now is the most effective television advertising that television had ever seen. And arguably, it\\'s the most effective advertising at scale ever. So I don\\'t anticipate that most of those dollars are moving to formats that are way different and way different location in the funnel like search or social. Those budgets are not going there. It does have -- as you point out, it does have the opportunity to leave video. But why would it when CTV is way more effective? And I would argue that the effectiveness has gone up more than the cost. And that as we see supply and demand continue, we might see more opportunities to find value as well as the target. And then, of course, as UID adoption continues to go up, the efficacy will as well. So even though I think we\\'re doing the most effective advertising that we\\'ve ever done in television, I think there\\'s still lots of room for exponential growth in efficacy. So when you look at all of those sort of macro trends and with the facts, I think it\\'s inevitable that CTV gets the vast majority of that transitioning from linear and traditional and even potentially, additional spend. So Laura, your portion of that question.\\nLaura Schenkein: Yes, fantastic. So in talking about the guide, what I would say is that we guide to what we see. We always have since I\\'ve been here. That includes what\\'s been observed quarter-to-date through the 9th of November. It also includes what our team and what our clients are indicating for the rest of the year. And though I recognize that there\\'s cautiousness in the environment, so all of that is taken into consideration. So I\\'m optimistic for the remainder of Q4. And we believe in this environment. It\\'s good to listen to our customers, listen to our team and it\\'s better to be cautious.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist.\\nYoussef Squali: Just one question on CTV. Jeff, can you maybe expand a little bit more on your comments around the different ways of buying CTV programmatic versus insertion orders versus programmatic guaranteed. Maybe where are we today in terms of percentage of CTV that\\'s bought programmatically? And what is the biggest kind of hurdle to kind of get in it to become kind of the standard, the majority of the way people buy it -- interact with it?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So I would say today and these are very broad buckets. This isn\\'t a reflection of our spend. This is me giving a commentary on the macro space. As the dollar moves over from traditional television into CTV, it\\'s mostly gone into 3 different buckets relatively evenly. The first is to work directly with the content owner and create essentially an insertion order again. The second is to work with us through a programmatic guaranteed and then the third is to work through biddable fully decisioned programmatic. Those have roughly been equal. You\\'re seeing the first and second converge and then the third category is, of course, the fastest growing. So when I talk about the need for television to embrace programmatic, I\\'m really talking about the need for it to embrace fully-decisioned programmatic because that\\'s where content owners get higher CPMs. That\\'s also where advertisers get the highest effectiveness and that\\'s the only place where they\\'re willing to pay a premium. The first and second have been increasingly converging over the last couple of years, while those were even a few years ago. More and more, they\\'re moving towards the second and third category with the final destination really being that third category. That\\'s how we see all of CTV moving because that\\'s where efficacy and price and the healthiness of the ecosystem stabilizing.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\\nTim Nollen: Jeff, I\\'ve got a CTV question as well, please. If I heard you right, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about some OpenPath efforts already taking shape in CTV. OpenPath, you started what, 1.5 years ago, if I remember right, on -- focused on journalistic publishers. Could you just elaborate on what you were doing with OpenPath with direct relationships into CTV, please?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I appreciate the question. So let me just remind everybody what OpenPath is. And Tim, again, really appreciate the question because I think this is something we haven\\'t talked enough about. And you are right. OpenPath celebrated its first birthday at the beginning of this year. And it\\'s been the fastest-growing path, if you will, or a route supply chain to inventory on our platform. And what it is, is the ability for publishers who want to do their own yield management to plug in to us directly. Where historically they would use an SSP. This time, they can plug into us directly. Part of the reason for that is because more and more companies are wanting to do their own yield management. We initially really highlighted the need for journalists or journalistic outlets to embrace this because their need for authentication as well as CPMs to go up was greater than any other part of the ecosystem. So it was really launched with journalism because that\\'s where they needed the help the most. Where it moves the needle perhaps the most is in connected television. And the reason why it moves the needle so much in connected television is because the content ownership, unlike on the browsing web, where you have millions of websites, you only have dozens of companies in the U.S. And as I\\'ve said before, I believe television is perfectly fragmented for a business like ours. But that makes it so that they\\'re all big enough for them to have their own yield management functions. It makes it so that we can plug in directly with them and then make certain that the option has a higher degree of integrity than if it were routed through Google or somewhere else for that matter. So we\\'ve launched OpenPath as a means of making certain that the pipes are clean and that has made certain that connected television has an ecosystem or a supply chain that is cleaner than others which is really great for CTV and its future. Thanks for the question.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.\\nMatt Swanson: Jeff, you\\'ve talked a few times on this call about taking market share about macros and then being able to invest more aggressively in a positive. We\\'ve obviously seen in the numbers that you\\'ve taken market share over the past couple of years. Can you just talk to us when that macro does flip hopefully sooner than later, one, how do you protect those market share gains? And two, like what are those first steps when you return to investment, whether it is to protect that market share or go after new markets as the macro improves?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So implicit in the question is that, hey, when -- as the macro continues to improve, where will you make additional investments? We\\'re investing as aggressively as we can right now. So I know we\\'re sort of showing our operating leverage but that\\'s not because we\\'re saying let\\'s flex our operating leverage. We\\'re instead trying to grow as aggressively as we can. But as Laura highlighted in the change in headcount both this year and next year as it relates to our overall growth, that\\'s in part because we surged our hiring during the pandemic and over the last few years so that we could capture opportunities like this one, including that we\\'re shipping the biggest release in the history of the company this year. We started that in June. We\\'ve been releasing throughout the year. So we\\'ll continue to make investments in that same way. But I believe those are the investments that are making it so that it\\'s really hard for anybody to take that away from us. We spend most of our time thinking about how we compete with the biggest technology companies in the world. And the way that we compete is not to play the game the way they do. Most of them have conflict of interest all over the place and most brands are terrified to hand over their data and honestly to hand over their future to those businesses so that they\\'re dependent on growth to come from just handing over their budgets and hoping that they get good stuff. Instead with us, they have somebody who doesn\\'t own any media and that is a feature, not a bug, in that we help them objectively decide what media they should buy because we don\\'t have a dog in that hunt. And by not having a conflict of interest, we help them to buy objectively across the entire media landscape, especially the most perfectly fragmented portion of that which is in CTV. The best way for us to stay ahead and I say this to our team all the time, is to do the very same things that got us here. We align our interest with our clients, we maintain our objectivity and we innovate like hell. And that\\'s what we\\'ve been doing all this year. That\\'s what we expect to continue to do. That becomes even easier to do from an IR standpoint as times get better and better. But we\\'ve been doing it now. We\\'ll keep doing it in the future. That\\'s what got us here. That\\'s what\\'s going to get us to the future that we know we can obtain if we just keep executing.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Kuntarich with UBS.\\nChris Kuntarich: Maybe one here for Laura, just going back to the guide. Can you give us a sense for how fast or if we were growing in October? And just kind of how we should be thinking about kind of what\\'s implied potentially if it were an exit rate in December in that 18% growth where was October potentially kind of if it was growing, say, 10% in October and we\\'re talking about a stabilization potentially around where the full year guide, could we be exiting in kind of that low 20s growth that you talked about where the guide implies where you would be for the full quarter ex political?\\nLaura Schenkein: Chris, I appreciate the question. We actually aren\\'t going to provide further guidance on exact year-over-year growth figures, both with and without election spend in the base for October, the first week of November or exiting the year. But you know correctly that we did see that drop-off in the second week of October and stabilization going into November. So all of that is factored into that guide.\\nChris Kuntarich: Okay. So was -- any color, was October actually growing that you could share?\\nLaura Schenkein: Of course, it was growing. I\\'m smiling as I say that.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.\\nLaura Martin: I\\'ll just ask one on CTV. When I talk to Disney and Paramount and Fox and they are always saying they have direct sales forces. They think they get a higher price point selling content which is not substitutable. And they\\'re definitely afraid of the third bucket that you talk about which is -- which you think is the final destination which is biddable programmatic because they\\'ve seen what\\'s happened in mobile and desktop and it\\'s sort of a race to the bottom because of unlimited supply. So can you speak to the fact of why -- like, by the way, Michael Barrett yesterday on Magnite call said, he completely disagrees with you, that it\\'s all going to stay in those first 2 buckets. So can you explain why you think the final destination is all going to be biddable when that is not what I\\'m hearing from my premium content owners.\\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So I suppose it depends on who you ask inside of those premium content owners. But to me, the math is fairly obvious and even conceptually, it\\'s fairly obvious. And I know that Michael Barrett\\'s business can\\'t really participate on the buy-side decisioning that is that third bucket. So it\\'s natural for him to focus on the first 2 and talk about the things that are great about those 2 buckets. But if you step back, the third bucket which is fully-decisioned programmatic is the one where the advertiser gets to bring their own data to the equation, is the one where they say, \"These are the users that I want.\" It\\'s the one where it realizes the potential of CTV advertising because the ads are relevant. Every single person here or hearing this has seen television ads that are not relevant to them. And that\\'s driven by a system that has historically always been focused on content, where I want to match this advertiser with this content and just sort of spray and pray. That isn\\'t what will happen in the future. That isn\\'t what\\'s happening in that third bucket today which is that you can bring your own data and show ads that are highly relevant so that you don\\'t just use the show as a proxy for audience. The show was always used as proxy for audience. And sometimes, it lines up really nicely which is most people who watch football are more likely to drink beer. And so as a result, those 2 have been married really well. And that\\'s part of the reason why ESPN content is some of the most expensive. But if you can take an ID and make certain that the ad is relevant and customize that and make it so that you\\'re only showing ads to those that are relevant, only then can you make it so that these 4 minutes per 60 that are being used for ads which is what, 1/4 of what happens in traditional television, only then can you make the CPMs go up high enough to justify the additional cost. So long-term, we\\'re all heading to that last bucket. It\\'s the only place where the math makes sense. It\\'s the only place where you really get the benefits of digital. And inside of all of those big content companies, there are groups of people that understand that, that\\'s where we\\'re all heading, even though not necessarily everybody gets that the traditional models of selling are not the best ways to monetize television going forward.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Laura. Operator, you can close out the call.\\nOperator: This concludes today\\'s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.']],\n",

       "[Document(page_content='Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you, that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around any macroeconomic deceleration, potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in various regions where we operate, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend in our platform, are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the Risk Factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. Lastly, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Analyst Day on Tuesday, October 4, 2022 in New York City. This event will be webcast and available on our Investor Relations website. I’ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you’ve seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share, despite some macroeconomic uncertainty. In the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, the Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and Connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we sign new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven’t spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I’d like to today, because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment. Joint business plans, or JBPs, our long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multi-year period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnerships and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world’s largest automakers and technology companies along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs. Many people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and wind share regardless of the economic environment. I’d like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back. First, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that’s the worldwide shift to advertising fueled connected television. I don’t know that we’ve ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic. The second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google’s ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last two decades, when dollars move over from offline spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment, that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google’s advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world. CTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though, because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or double click, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive, because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound coupled with these competitive market dynamics for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV. CTV is fast becoming a must buy. And in some cases, the highest stack rank part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content. And lastly, I’d like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we’re doing and how we’re taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple years. We’ve seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the states attorneys general concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google’s ads business, but it’s not just here in the United States, it’s also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the UK’s competitive market authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the UK. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, we’re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising costs for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google’s biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity. By contrast, we don’t own any inventory and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can’t overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising. Especially, the large brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I’m confident we will do well, regardless of Google’s moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand side platform or DSP. In addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I am often asked to speak about the open internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet. I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I’m concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google’s behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that’s for another day, I believe so long as we execute The Trade Desk is going to do well, regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly, as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we’re so optimistic about our future. So with that, let’s shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics, and how we’re executing. So let’s discuss what’s happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we’re very clear on our mission and we’re extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side and our goals are clear to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain. It’s because of these factors that more and more of the world’s leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It’s also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it’s Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated or Amazon’s AWS ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2. The same with Experian who’s using UID2 as a common currency, where Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brands, selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this. I also want to talk about Netflix recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models, similar to how they led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We’ve had many constructive conversation with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising. The Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet, the fact that Netflix didn’t choose Google is very telling. We believe it’s another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest. Xandr is a strong sell side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they’ve done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable demand side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher in this case Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy. Disney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad supported option. The economics of the market demanded. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them. For example, one of our early CTV partners NBC continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery+ and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world’s leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising. And CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It’s where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It’s where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged in user base is where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. There is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They’ve spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized, experience across all of their channels, but as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumer’s privacy is highly protected. As you’ve seen Disney recently announced and expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their audience graph, which is now interoperable with UID2. Aaron LaBerge the President and CTO of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, perhaps set at best and I quote. The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buy net scale, and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney. I want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you’ve been paying attention to anything we’ve said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you’ll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I’ve said, I’m not sure it is ever in Google’s best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn’t really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google’s decision making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies that doesn’t really capture the scope of what’s going on. And Disney is a great example of this. Disney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It’s much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner. Part of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here, is because we’ve already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that’s something of this central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform. And AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian marketing services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets. As we’ve said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bills. First and foremost, it’s about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry. And with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need pure more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that’s why I’m confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said, at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Of course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty, but even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009, while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gain share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it’s because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar, that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decision advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there’s no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk. Throughout the first half of 2022, and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part that’s because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing, advertising that delivers the highest return and CTV has moved up the priority list. So, while we can’t control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We will never rest on our laurels, as one of the few high growth tech companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company’s history. A year later, a 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform. With all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet. Within Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and Target and we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it’s the data infrastructure work that’s already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EUID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction. We continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We’re working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year’s upfront and early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory. As I said, at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead. And with that, I’ll pass the baton to Blake, who’ll give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top-line growth of 35% is especially impressive, given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spent, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of. During the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We’ve successfully completed a full transition to Solimar and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression. We are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although, it is still very early days for us spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well. With the continued strong top-line performance in Q2, we generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again, in Q2. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live companywide event and over three years, resumed and travel also continued to ramp up. From a channel perspective, CTV via a wide margin, let our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV represented a low-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, and display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency, as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represents at least 1% of our spend, fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year, but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, CTV spend in Europe, again more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investment so will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data driven with their ad spend much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend nearly all of them groom the double digits during the quarter, both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average however, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally automotive still grew the double-digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses, Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $250 million up 45% year-over-year. Growth and operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development. As we continue to build the platform for long-term growth, as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock based awards, the timing of which are variable. Adjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days up nine days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days up six days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3. While there’s continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question is coming from Shyam Patil from Susque. Your line is live.\\nShyam Patil: Hey guys, congrats on the results and the outlook. Jeff, I wanted to ask, this is now the second quarter in a row where your results and outlook are significantly better than, what we’re seeing from other app supported companies, especially in the face of a slowing macro. And I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, what you think is driving that outperformance? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Well, so first let me just say, I’m incredibly proud of our Q3, r the start to our Q3 and especially our performance in Q2. But let me just highlight just a couple of the things that have really gone our way in Q2 and given us so much momentum going into Q4 or going into Q3 and Q4. First, we have an amazing secular tailwind of CTV, arguably the best secular tailwind we’ve ever had. Second, we are of course, seeing the benefits of Solimar, which we’ve gone to a 100% and it just has all these benefits to our clients. Third, we’ve got this, this momentum around the joint business plans where we’re just getting closer to brands and we’re creating better partnerships with each of them. And one of the things that they’re excited about is just our relationships in shopper marketing, the overall call, we started with the very biggest retailer in the world in Walmart and we just continued to expand on that. We highlighted some of those included Albertsons during the prepared remarks. But I do want to emphasize that we have never claimed to be a bellwether of the economy or of advertising yet. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of times people look at our performance and say, how is this so different than everybody else’s? And what is often happening is, we are winning because of those secular tailwinds and because programmatic is growing share and because digital is growing share and meanwhile it is possible to have some macroeconomic headwinds in our face and have a secular tailwind of CTV and all the things I just talked about that, that overshadow that. And I think what we are seeing right now is just an amazing trend, which is that, that CTV in particular is extremely competitive. It’s also extremely effective. And so, as people are looking for alternatives to walled gardens they are looking to companies like us, who can give them objectivity to buy across all these fragmented places. Many of the smaller walled gardens, I think are especially under pressure. And as I’ve said, I think CTV can be the thing that brings down the walled gardens. But that’ll start with those that are smallest. So, I think often, we’re being compared to walled gardens of various sizes, and I don’t necessarily think that the fair comparison, and of course, I think we’re also in anomaly from the macro. So, hopefully that par is out all those things, but I’m really proud of what we did in Q2 and really optimistic about our Q3.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Shyam.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov [Cannonball]. Your line is live.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Just to follow up maybe on this, on the first question, can you, Jeff, please talk about what’s going on in Connected TV. I’m sure, that some Connected TV players reported fairly slow growth in Q2 and guided to continued slow growth in the remainder of the year. So and if I listen to your remarks and assuming that your Connected TV spend is growing at least double your overall spend, that would imply at least 50% growth. So can you explain to us, how to understand that what the diversification is about and does the quick follow up there, maybe you can tell us about how you use the terms scatter market and spot market in Connected TV that sort of became a thing this earning season?\\nJeff Green: Yes, no problem first. And thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, CTV is a secular tailwind that it continues to help drive our business. I would even say it continues to lead our business, including our growth. The scale that we’re seeing is amazing. And the changes in the world, including the pandemic, which made everybody stay home and stream a lot more, have created changes to the ecosystem that I don’t think anybody predicted. And, if you just take a step back and you think about if five years ago, you would’ve thought that HBO and Netflix would be showing ads I think a lot of people were public about saying that isn’t going to happen and it’s happening now, so there are these tailwinds that I just can’t overstate. And that as a result, CTV is often becoming the place where the very first dollar it is spent. But one of the things, I really like about your question and it gives me a platform to talk about is, okay, well then why isn’t everyone in CTV seeing the same sort of growth that you are seeing? And there are a couple reasons for that one. There are some companies that are deployed the walled garden strategy, which is that I have something special either on my operating system or on my channel, and you should buy that exclusively through me. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no one in CTV has a position that is strong enough to be draconian the same way that you can in other parts of digital like search or social or some of those others. So as a result those tactics, I think are proving more difficult as more and more choices are coming online. So a platform that sits objectively and helps people choose across the 20, 30, 40 places where you can buy, I mean, think of your own habits as a consumer, you were probably watching CTV on two or three apps five years ago. Now you’re probably watching them on seven, eight, nine, 10 plus that fragmentation creates a greater need for somebody to centrally partner with all of them measure, reach, and frequency and performance across all of them, and has to have a business model that is eligible to partner with everybody. So that’s why I would argue that we have outperformed everybody else is that unique position and that unique strategy that we’ve deployed as it relates to scatter versus spot and there, I know in this earning season, there has been some discussion about scatter, let me just break it down really simply, scatter is a reference to linear or traditional television where you buy things in upfront, those things that either don’t work out as planned or need to be adjusted to you create this middle market, where you’re buying traditional television with traditional budgets in not very sophisticated, quickly adapt market. Separately from that is a spot market. And what I would call the spot market is the programmatic market that we operate in. And so when people talk about scatter and spot, especially because when they’re talking to people in the financial industry, they can draw analogies to equities. That don’t seem that different, but really what we’re talking about in television one is very closely associated with the upfront market, which was invented in the 60s. The other one we’re talking about digital that brings all of the data and decisioning to bear that, that the internet can really offer that is what makes it so television is going to get better and better, which is there are going to be fewer ads. They are going to be more relevant. There are going to be highly effective. And that funds content at a rate that has never been seen before, that can only be done by a spot market and a forward market, not a legacy upfront market and scatter market. So those are the reasons, why there’s a big difference in rhetoric around scatter versus spot. The spot market is amazingly strong, the strongest it has ever been. And that’s because of the variety of apps that are coming into the ecosystem and the need for ad funded content because all of them need ad dollars in order to continue to fund their content making machines.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Vasily.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is live.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, could you just spend a little more talking about – a little more time talking about what the Disney partnership means for your business? How much access does this deal give you to Disney’s premium CTV inventory and to what magnitude does it grow your footprint for UID? That’s my first question. And my second is for Blake just around hiring plans. We’ve definitely heard a lot of companies in the ad industry pulling back on hiring. So just would love to hear where you guys sit on hiring plans for 2022. Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Awesome. Thanks. I’ll go first and I’ll let Blake go and just to order you asked the question. So let me first just reiterate our strategy in UID2. So first, we created UID2. We open sourced it, we gave it to the ecosystem. This is not ours, but it is something that we really want to see successful because we think there needs to be a privacy safe currency that makes it possible for personalization to take place at large scale. That needs to replace cookies, but it also needs to do way more than that. And when people reduce it down to a discussion about replacing cookies, it doesn’t really capture what it’s about. It is a currency of the Internet that makes personalization and privacy control way better than it exists today. The way that you win that way, the way that you fix the infrastructure of the Internet, which can be massively upgraded, especially so that consumers have more control over privacy is that you partner with the infrastructure. Many might mistakenly think the way that you change the infrastructure of the Internet as you partner with millions of publishers or millions of apps or hundreds of content creators in television. And instead, it’s to start with the infrastructure. So the deal with Disney wouldn’t have easily been done if we hadn’t already partnered with Salesforce or Snowflake or a Adobe or AWS, some of those infrastructure plays that make it possible. But because we had it made it easy for us to then have great conversations with Disney. Additionally, Disney has done an amazing job of assembling all of its different assets, including Hulu, which was one of the first Connected TV plays to really understand the benefit of highly relevant ads and high CPMs that come from relevance. And that you of course have to have a strategy around identity and personalization in order to get those high CPMs and in order to get that benefit. So I think one of the things that Disney has really led the way on is making certain that all the way at the top of their technical organization, they have a clear understanding of what it takes to provide personalization and consumer privacy protection and control at the same time. And while doing that, I think that they have made it possible to better monetize Hulu, ESPN, ABC, Disney+, FX, and so many other things that they own. Because they own so many of those and because I think they understand that relationship at the highest levels of the organization, I think this partnership is really significant, because number one, I think Disney has a clear strategy going forward that some others don’t. And two, I think we’ve established ourselves as a great partner of theirs, and we continue to provide them with an amazing amount of demand and high CPMs that is going to fuel their business and better content. Because they represent such a significant amount of the inventory, and especially because almost everything in CTV is logged in, this represents a massive step forward for UID for an authenticated Internet for a better internet. And when you look at extended runway for cookies going away, as well as just the need for CTV to get a better at monetizing. This represents a move forward for everyone. So I do think Disney is proving itself to be a leader once again. So it’s hard to overstate the significance of the partnership. Blake?\\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. James, regarding your question on the hiring, I just would take just a real quick moment to step back a little bit. If we think about where we are in our business, we have – we’re in one of the greatest situations I think a company could ask for, right. We’ve got high top line growth, high EBITDA growth with strong margins and we also generate solid consistent annual free cash flow. And so having those three things operating together for me, it’s got super special meaning as you can imagine. And what it does is it gives us the opportunity and the ability to be deliberate with our choices. And in doing so, I’m also proud of our ability to stay disciplined with those investments, regardless of the operating environment that we’re in. You mentioned what other companies are doing. And based on what we’re hearing, well, there are many of our peers that might have more resources, that are pausing, hiring or cutting investments because they invested too aggressively. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple years like I – it sounds like many companies did. And I think that’s really paid off for us. It’s given us the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and including hiring, which is one of the largest ones that we will entertain. And so like we mentioned earlier this year, we expect to increase the pace of our investments as we focus on the long-term growth of the business, but we’re always going to stay mindful of long-term productivity supported by our business model. So with regards to hiring and how it affects expenses and such, our Q2 EBITDA was super strong and that included our first full company in-person event that we had in over three years. Our Q3 forecast reflects that investment thesis that we can continue to generate strong EBITDA and invest for the long-term. And we’re focused in hiring in areas that fuel our growth, whether that’s engineering or business development or account management roles. And so I’m comfortable with the trajectory that we’re on and where things stand. And I really think that we can pursue those investments in an operating expense structure that we believe is actually better than pre-pandemic. So I really like the position we’re in to drive more efficiency, more EBITDA and free cash flow, but also as we scale. And so I’m really excited about our situation there.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, James.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. And obviously congrats on a really strong performance all things considered. Jeff with the – with Netflix going with Microsoft and Xandr being SSP, but also DSP itself. What does that mean for the Trade Desk opportunity with Netflix over time? And as there is going to be a great deal of inventory coming into the CTV market from Netflix, and I guess others just, could that be a depressing factor for pricing for Connected TV in the short and medium-term? Then Blake, maybe just a quick one with Solimar’s adoption at now a 100%. I think that’s what you said in the prepared remarks. Anyway to help quantify the contribution of that software upgrade to the outperformance this quarter. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Youssef for the question. I actually was hoping somebody would ask about Netflix and Microsoft, because I think it’s one of the most exciting scenes that’s happened in our space in it in the quarter. So let me first just restate something that, that Netflix stated on their earnings call, which I think is a direct quote, it’s still early days. So Netflix has been like learning about the advertising business or in the advertising business for only a few months as they’re – have established a very important, but early partnership. But I – for one was very excited when I learned that they had selected Microsoft for a number of reasons, as many of you know, I worked at Microsoft before I sold the first ad exchange to Microsoft. I in fact introduced the President of the ads division to – at the time, the CEO of AppNexus, which later became Xandr. So it’s been a part of my personal journey, as well as the fact that I’ve just been very close to AppNexus and Xandr, of course, Xandr now being owned by Microsoft. Xandr, as you point out Youssef, it has a small DSP, but it is primarily an SSP. They primarily focus on the sell side. If you look at the – if you were to stack rank the major players of demand for CTV, I think you’d find that we are the largest and somewhere around number 10 near the bottom of the top 10 list would be Xandr in terms of size. I would estimate that they provide less than 10% of the demand to other independent inventory or content companies. So as a result, what I think that means for us and for the open Internet is that the role that Microsoft is going to play for Netflix is one where they are helping them get started. They’re helping them create a clear identity strategy. I think they very clearly are going to have to have a strategy both for identity, as well as for monetization that involves the open Internet. Because this is early days, it’s less important to me about the role the Trade Desk plays with Netflix in the crawl phase than it does in the walk and the run phase. And to me, selecting Microsoft makes it, so it’s nearly inevitable that Netflix will be a part of the open Internet and that they’ll welcome demand from lots of different places. And that will be the only way that they can maximize their inventory and get the highest CPMs possible, as somebody who wants to see Netflix do well and has a strong relationship with Netflix leadership. I think this is a solid plan. It’s a great start. There’s a lot of work ahead of them, but I think that we are extremely likely to have a great partnership with them over the long-term, but there’s a lot of stuff that has to be done in order for Netflix to be the leader in AVOD that they’ve been in SVOD. So – but I’m looking forward to it.\\nBlake Grayson: And then with regards to your question on Solimar is a high. I’m really excited about the traction that we’ve seen that I think the product really separates us from the competition and we did reach a 100% usage. I think that it took us about a year to get there. I think the last major product update check like 50% longer in the amount of time it took. So it’s a real Testament to the team and the value that I think we’re providing the customers that are doing that upgrade. And so on a usage basis, the trends look good like average data elements used per impression, it’s more than doubled for the same customers on our previous platform. Average channel usage has increased over 50%. And then the AI, machine learning element that we have the adoption on that on Solimar, I think it increased around 50% versus the prior platform. And this is all about getting customers a better ROI. If we can do that, they’re going to return again for future campaigns and we think it – what that does is it spins the flywheel for everybody for us included. And so just really excited about the momentum here and really proud actually what the team was able to deliver.\\nYoussef Squali: Thank you, both.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef.\\nOperator: Okay. Up next we have Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is live.\\nTim Nollen: I peak my interest, especially about the spot market response a few questions ago being a forward market and how it’s different from scatter. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks about a forward market product. I wonder if you could help maybe explain a bit more, what that is. Is this something that sets you up for more of a upfront participation for CTV guaranteed deals next year or maybe just a bit more color on what that is. And then I’m assuming Unified ID 2.0 will factor in to all of this. And you said you’re optimistic about this becoming kind of a transaction standard for this year. Would UID2 be playing a more prominent role in measurement or attribution of CTV ads going forward?\\nJeff Green: Thanks for the questions, Tim. So maybe aside from CTV, my favorite topic to talk about is actually forward market. And I especially love to talk about it in the context of investors, just because you live the concept every single day, even though, it’s somewhat more into advertising. So first of all, the upfront this process where you commit to buy ads on television was a process that was created in the early 60s. In fact, we’ve sort of jokingly made comparison, maybe half jokingly made comparison to the fact that the audio cassette was invented the same year that the TV upfronts were and audio cassettes obviously have evolved, we don’t use them anymore in our daily lives, but the upfront hasn’t changed much and the process is exactly the same. You have a party or an event, where you commit dollars to advertising for the better part of the year with the absence of data and transactions like it’s just – in a way it’s even strange that as an industry it’s still happens that way. I mean, if we had a forward market for tulips, that was exactly the same as it was 400 years ago. We would look for ways to evolve. We would do something different. So the forward market that we’re developing with our partners is much more like a commodities market, where you have forward contracts, you use data and forecasting to get the benefits of commitment. And the thing that is really amazing about TV ads in particular is that publishers are willing to take less money if you’ll commit to buy it in advance. And advertisers are willing to pay more money, if they can have the assurance that they’re going to get it. I mean, imagine, you wouldn’t spend $3 million, $4 million or $5 million to make a Super Bowl ad, if you didn’t know it was going to run during the Super Bowl. So commitments can be a really important part of television. And so as we move to CTVs, there’s no reason to create a rudimentary 1960s version of a forward market. We should create one that leverages all the very best parts of programmatic takes all the learnings of commodities markets and utilizes that very – the very best things about programmatic. So we’ve developed that its early days, but we have a good commitment from both buyers and sellers to make it possible to create a much better and stronger market. The only way that that works is if you have good forecasting and the only way that that works is if you have a common currency like UID2. So two – the second part of your question, does UID2 play a significant role in that? Absolutely. Because in order for us to give a common understanding to buyers to sellers, it’s one thing to buy in the spot market where you’re buying an ad for less than a penny in almost every case. It’s another thing to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in advance to buying ads. You need a greater degree of assurance. You need greater transparency. You need visibility that can only come from forecasts where you have a common understanding, common currencies become very important in order to have any market other than a spot market, unless you’re operating in discounts and constantly working on make goods, which is exactly what the upfront and scatter markets do in traditional television. Thanks, Tim.\\nOperator: Okay. Next we have Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try two, please. So, Jeff for the business, there have always been several growth factors or growth vectors from international to shopper marketing to CTV to Solimar to UID2. Now with Solimar fully integrated and CTV clearly driving growth. How about the other three, the UID2, international and shopper marketing? Does the extension of cookies – cookie deprecation change your focus or investment towards UID2? And then how are you thinking about international and shopper marketing in general over the next six to, call it, 18 months. And then a question for Blake, is possible to get the magnitude of contribution from retail or Walmart and other partnerships, as well as political spend for the third quarter. That’s baked in your guide. Thank you very much.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I’m glad you’ve asked about just these other growth drivers and of course, how does UID affect it and especially just how does the deprecation of cookies affect UID and international expansion and shopper marketing? So I’m not certain that we made this as clear as we could’ve in the prepared remarks. Cookies and ads that are bought inside a browser, because cookies are only relevant inside of a browser at least directly relevant inside of a browser, represents a small percentage of our business. Display is a small percentage of our business. It’s – as a percentage, it’s shrinking, even though, we’ve seen growth, because growth in other areas are growing faster. It’s still continues to shrink. So it’s a small slice of the pie. What are much bigger are things like mobile, which don’t rely on cookies or CTV, which don’t rely on cookies. They have other ways of creating identity. That, of course, in CTV, nearly everything you do is on the other side of a login, meaning you log into Netflix or you log to Amazon or you log into Peacock or Paramount or Hulu before you view content. And that makes it very prone to be interoperable with something like UID2. So there’s no cookie problem to solve in TV, but everybody in TV needs more subscribers, and I believe everybody in TV needs to offer an AVOD solution for those subscribers that would rather pay with their time than with money. And especially when you have to keep providing or making rate hikes in order to pay for incremental content. So the cookie changes don’t slow down UID at all. And in fact, I’ve always said that the biggest threat to the walled gardens is the competitive nature of Connected Television. That’s especially true in identity and the competitive nature of television is really what I think will fuel UID forward faster than anything that happens with cookies delay or not. But the same thing is true internationally. I mean, especially if you look at the places where GDP growth is predicted to be the highest in the world, those are places that are often mobile first, so they’re less reliant on cookies as well, so especially in Asia. So business models that have a holistic approach to identity and can customize ads to think holistically are the ones that are going to do the best, especially for the biggest companies in the world, which is why I think we’re really in a strong position for international growth. And thirdly, as it relates to international, I think it’s fair to say, there’s more likely to be economic headwinds outside the United States than inside the United States. It given that we look at this as land grab time. So there is a big opportunity for us to expand our market share. Even if there are economic headwinds internationally, that we just want to continue to invest in, especially because outside of big competitors like the Google’s of the world where their DSP is not their primary focus for those smaller competitors where being a DSP is their primary focus. They’re often much smaller and can’t afford to make those investments. So there’s a big opportunity for us to expand around the world. And then in shopper marketing, it – there is this incredible desire, especially inside of CPGs, and CPGs for a whole bunch of reasons, including inflation are under pressure to do more with less. And what can really help them is to see end-to-end. If I show an ad to this person, how did it affect whether they buy it, add a store to see end-to-end, the impact of their spend is extremely valuable to them. And retailers know that that is a way for them to spin their flywheels faster. Initially they looked at it as a way to make more money on selling data, but now they look at it as a way to spin their flywheels faster. And so I think it’s one of the surest ways that we will spin our own flywheel is to continue to enable an open internet where there’s lots of competition and where marketers that sell goods inside of stores, brick-and-mortar stores continue to get the data driven benefits that historically have been reserved for online retailers like Amazon. So, where everybody is looking at competing with Amazon, they know they have to be focused on becoming as data driven or more than they are. And we’re just seeing amazing strides in retail that, that contributes to our shopper marketing strategy. So, we’ve just seen our TAM expand in the short term, just because of this focus of moving to fixing this sort of end-to-end challenge. And I do think it is true that the discussion about the demise of cookies has made that faster, even though it’s a totally different aspect of measurement, but it is improved and accelerated the move to better measurement, which I don’t know that there’s any place that’s better off in those places where we’re doing end-to-end measurement and shopper marketing,\\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up sort to on your other questions, I think, on the shopper marketing component, we don’t break out that level of detail in our shopper marketing business. The only thing I could just say is that, we are seeing the spend ramp, it ramped into Q2 is more large brands, test our testing and adopting it and we expect that to continue. I think just the selection opportunity that our customers are going, are now having is going to be a flywheel spin for them that I debate in my head, whether they’re going to be able to get it very many other places, if any. And so I think that’s just such a long-term opportunity for us like Jeff said, I’m just; I’m super excited about it. And then with regards to your question on political, in the midterms, the spend will occur much closer to Election Day than we might find in a presidential year, like we expect to see that start ramping here over the late summer. I would say through November, there’s so many races out there that are going to be competitive, and we’ll just have to see how competitive, whether it’s the House the Senate, governor campaigns or whatnot. I think that our overall expectation, and is that the in Q3, we expected to be a low single-digit percentage spend in Q3. And that was in our prepared remarks as well. But overall just with regards to political, what I would say is, our goal is to it’s to run a better process, it’s to earn trust with our customers. We’ve been building this business over quite a few years. We’ve got really high retention rates with our customers. We do believe, we’re the go to platform for digital advertising now versus maybe other social media platforms. And so we do expect some tailwinds. That’s why we called it out in the guidance, but we’ll have to see how this all unfolds into the back half of the year.\\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks.\\nJeff Green: And then John, we can squeeze in one more.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys for squeezing me in this. Just as a quick follow up to the forwarded market concept. We wanted to ask about refundability or resalability of inventory, if you will. If an advertiser takes delivery, for example, finds out that an impression or a consumer is already a customer Jeff, are you envisioning that advertisers would’ve the ability to resale inventory and any thoughts on the dynamics there in terms of market liquidity, and participation, and really potential financialization of the market? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I think at initially what you’re going to want to see is control from both publishers or content owners and advertisers in terms of who shows up? Who has access to it? But I do think that in the long term, and we’re talking years from now, one way that you can get buyers to sign up is if they buy too much, they can sell it to somebody else. And so I do think it’s possible to see a derivatives market exist sort of on top of that forward market, so that you can essentially transact in the rights to buy those so that you can secure inventory. But making them fungible makes it, or resellable, or both rather, as I think a really important part of the market in the long term. So, I do think that that component will exist in the long-term, but the most important thing in the short term is to take advantage of the fact that you can bring data to bear that publishers want guarantees and all the benefits of programmatic advertisers would like to reserve inventory and have all the benefits of programmatic, which includes the ability for them to bring their data into the equation. In traditional television, as well as in the scatter market, advertisers can’t really bring their own data to the table. So, the forward market would enable them to do that, which would help prices go up and is really going to benefit, both the buyer and the seller. I think there’s going to be a lot of rules that exist for years to prevent the resale of that. But I do think long-term the economic incentives are there for that to exist. It creates an amazing market. And I don’t think that there’s any company that’s better positioned to benefit from this market than The Trade Desk, because of the role that we play by looking at everything by looking at nearly all inventory, because we don’t own it. We make it possible to partner with all of it. And I think we can easily become once again, the world leader in providing demand, not just in the spot market, which we already are today, but also in the forward market, which is why we’re working so hard to create it, and leverage the relationships that we’ve been tending to for more than a decade now.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Brian.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

       " Document(page_content='Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are both Founder and CEO, Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses and Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results could vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. Spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record. CTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. Our results are often benchmarked against the Rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company’s growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth. In times of market uncertainty, perhaps it’s most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by Dentsu, total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I’d like to focus on why we are winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future. Specifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we have reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth. I don’t think we have ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we’re gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they will prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens. With that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year, a more than two-thirds of the market according to Group M. What’s driving these two trends? Well, as I have said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. I’d like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions, because I think it will give you a sense of why I am so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I’d like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever and it’s because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I’d like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023. So, let’s start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is? A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those two consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google. Our goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incents more competition and improves privacy standards and that’s exactly what we are starting to see. If you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don’t think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solve the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy. To be clear, I am talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2. This is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we have ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser’s first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies, simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before. They can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value. At CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way. Of course, it’s not just on the data side that we are seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet, because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world’s leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we have talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio. Just a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn’t agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important and CTV will continue to lead the charge here, because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem. There is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad-supported lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there is pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way. Advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their targeted audience than without UID2. That’s astonishing progress. And it’s just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world. The CTV is the kingpin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open Internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It’s not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it’s fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rationale enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers, and of course, media companies. Because of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that every theme in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we will see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that’s the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years, but the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy. To adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today’s digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust to buy the CPMs required to power today’s content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data. We will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we’re hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what’s interesting about this event is that I don’t think there is any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising. It will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it’s not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, a global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as Vidio, WeTV and iflix. For this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they have been achieving against user-generated content and the click-through rate was 15x higher. In addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren’t possible a few years ago. The recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media. I’d like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there is a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy. As I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States and we are growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don’t exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens. Once again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023? From an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won’t be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the themes I am preparing for as the CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift. Retail Media Networks will continue to grow in influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic. First, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won’t be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value. Second, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel, because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market. As we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet. I will close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I’ve met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023 and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast growing channels like CTV, they are finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale. CMOs also understand that while the current macro environment maybe uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath. And the world’s leading media companies are integrating with us so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model. Everyone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven, decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet. Right now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and Retail Media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail. Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It’s a comprehensive look at how Google operates including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that’s because our mission has always been to provide an open objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens. We focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It’s the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another. I could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we’ve talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don’t like to comment on competitors’ performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment. We continue to sign JVPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways. And I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world. Q4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to share and significantly outpaces our peers on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the 9th year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides to our customers has increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy. Deliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business level. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy. Our shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It’s worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q4. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes. Unlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA. Income tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. And finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances. Turning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1. Turning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment. We’re also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. We are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs to the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022. In closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We’re executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we’re amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we’re adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Thank you. Hey, guys. Congrats on the continued strong performance. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about just what you’re seeing and how you’re thinking about the macro this year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, can you provide a bit more color on the 1Q guide and anything in terms of linearity, that’s worth noting? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: First of all, Shyam, thanks. I appreciate the question and the kind words. So first, let me just say that we’re incredibly proud of our performance in 2022 and the start to 2023, of course, especially on a relative basis. So far, of course, relative to all other scale ad platforms and companies, public or private, we feel like our relative outperformance is greater than it’s ever been during 2022 as well as so far in 2023. From a macro standpoint, in early January, we – it’s a little bit of a late start due to the calendar year. We also saw the way that both brands and agencies were planning was a little bit delayed. But then we’ve seen things start to unlock. And we saw instead of there being delayed – instead of there being canceled, there was just delays and then those have become unpaused and unlocked since then. As a result, we’ve seen more JVPs and we’ve seen a lot more activity so far in 2023 than we’ve seen at any time to this point in any year previously. So overall, we’re very encouraged by the trend in 2023 so far, extremely optimistic, especially as we continue to grab land relative to all of our competitors.\\nBlake Grayson: And Shyam, this is Blake. I’ll try to answer your other – your second question. Just to go back a bit on Q4 real quick. Fundamentally, a great quarter despite the macro uncertainty out there. I’m really happy with the 24% year-over-year growth. It’s a standout versus our peers, many of which seem to have shrunk in Q4. CTV again leads the way for us. We’re grabbing land now. It lays the foundation for us when times are better. In the prepared remarks, you heard me say data adoption is really encouraging as it spins our customers’ flywheels. With regards to the linearity question, just to lay a little bit more like what Jeff talked about, a bit larger deceleration in December than normal from what we saw in October and November. But we’ve accelerated off that pretty consistently so far here in Q1, which is really nice to see. So I’m cautiously optimistic for the quarter. Some places are more challenged because of that uncertainty. But we see strong growth, especially in CTV and relative to the rest of the industry, we’re growing significantly faster than I think so many of our peers who are signaling declining or negative growth, and we’re growing in into the double digits, which, to me, just confirms that we’re taking share. And so even though there is uncertainty out there, I think we could be in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID as advertisers are prioritizing programmatic spend more. The only other thing I’d maybe add about the Q1 guide, just want to comp perspective is if you exclude the political election spend that we had in Q4 ‘22 that low single-digit percent share of spend, our quarter-over-quarter seasonality is trending just slightly better than we’ve seen on average. So I feel really good about Q1 so far, and I’m optimistic about the quarter.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam, Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matt Swanson at RBC Capital Markets.\\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. I’ll add my congratulations on the execution as well. Jeff, I want to ask you on all the Google developments we’ve seen in the quarter. I think a lot of us have read your thought pieces on the subject, which have been really insightful. But could you elaborate a little bit on what you think the near and long-term impact on the market is of the antitrust? And I think especially the comment you made about the market will become more fair one way or another. And then if I could add a quick follow-up. There was a beta launch of the Privacy Sandbox for Android last night. Does this change any thoughts around maybe the potential cookie deprecation time line or how likely this is to happen?\\nJeff Green: Thanks a lot, Matt, for the kind words as well as the question. So let me first just talk about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. So let me just give the sort of punchline first, which is that I believe we will win regardless of the outcome. So no matter what happens, I think we’re going to win. We have been winning in an unfair market. So – of course, if the market becomes more fair, which we think it will, as a result of this, like I said, one way or another. Then of course, that signifies significantly better environment for us to perform it. The Department of Justice has clearly done their homework on this, which I am extremely encouraged by. I know there is some at Google who tried to suggest that we have been through this three or four times before. I do believe that this is fundamentally different. And part of that is just because of how detailed I think the case is outlined. I do believe there are many possible outcomes here. There is lots of people that are talking about breaking it up. There is lots of other potential outcomes. But I do believe that in any case, this will slow down Google, there is a 100% chance of that. And so with them slowed down, with the market moving towards just better competition and more fairness, I believe there is no way that this isn’t good for us. I do want to acknowledge that as there is some pressure to just break up assets, I don’t believe that, that alone is enough. And that if that’s all this done, I think technology could be replaced and some of the same practices that got us here could happen again. So to me, the most important thing that happens here is that any settlement or any conclusion to the case ends with more fairness and restrictions to make certain that the market stays fair, especially when leveraging assets that are extremely nearing monopoly, if you will. So as it relates to Privacy Sandbox, there has been a lot that have been discussed about Privacy Sandbox in the past. It’s often, I think, wrongly compared to the world of cookies and doesn’t necessarily acknowledge the importance of relevance in order to create a free and open Internet that can subsidize the content that currently exist on the open Internet. So I don’t actually think that, that has much to do with the antitrust case or the deprecation of cookies or UID2, but certainly something to launch.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, Matt. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, guys. And congrats again on the really strong execution, all things considered. So I have two questions, one for Jeff and one for Blake. Jeff, can you maybe just share with us, based on the commentary you’ve made about walled gardens, etcetera, what signals are you looking for as an indication that if walled gardens will begin to take down their barriers, what will that look like for you guys? And then, Blake, can you maybe talk about your OpEx or just your margin expectations? Your Q1 margin implies basically you’re back to pre-COVID levels. You have to go back to like ‘18, ‘19 to get down to those low 20s margins. Is that kind of the right way of thinking about the cadence throughout the year? And then do you expect margin improvement this year relative to last year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: I’ll have Blake first, and then I’ll follow on with the question about walled gardens.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. So let me just step back a second and then I’ll try to get to all the details of the questions that you asked. Just want to remind everyone about the power of this business model. I’m a huge fan of it. High top line, growth generates solid adjusted EBITDA with strong margins generate consistent free cash flow generation. I’m really proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments for the past few years really paid off for us. Unlike many companies, either in the ad funded space or in the technology space, we’ve been pretty responsible managing our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. So there is – while many companies are pulling back or making some very tough decisions about the resourcing, we’re able to say the core grab share, combine that with actually growing into the double digit contracting. I think it sets us up really well. As we think about our operating expenses next year, it will increase year-over-year. That’s a combination of a couple of things. It’s a combination of the 2022 hiring flow-through that we’ve had. It’s also a combination of return-to-office expenses, including travel and live events. But again, we’re going to be deliberate about our investments in hiring and you heard on the prepared remarks, we’re going to grow our headcount in 2023. But as of right now, we’re thinking roughly at half the rate of 2022. We still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV and shopper marketing and be ready to capture those. The other thing I would say about Q1 is also just the seasonality of live events, there were live events that occurred in Q2 of 2022, and those will happen in Q1 of 2023. So the seasonality is important to pay a little bit of attention to. But overall, the way I would just say it is we’re comfortable with where things stand. I’m cautiously optimistic about our growth at the start of the year. Should we see a significant change? We have levers available to us to make those changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 with regards to the COVID. And I believe the operating expense structure of the company is actually is better than prior to the pandemic when you deal with that kind of seasonality issue that I was talking about. We’re in a great position to drive more long-term scale and efficiency as well as free cash flow. So I feel pretty good about that. Now Jeff?\\nJeff Green: To the first part of the question as it relates to walled gardens. So first, let me just remind everybody what walled garden is and I’ll give you just one of the definitions, which is that this is a destination that is essentially a must-have on a media plan. So that the owner of that destination, whether it’s a social network or a video platform or any other walled garden, the owner of that can afford to be draconian and set their own rules. And what’s happening in part because of CTV because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV is perfectly fragmented. And what it does is it makes it so that there are enough players that no one can afford to be draconian. And no one has enough market share to do that. But it’s also concentrated enough that you have very large sophisticated players that are making decisions, and so they are all hypercompetitive and actually hyperrational. So what I think that does is it puts a lot of pressure on walled gardens because of the fact that there is this alternative that are super competitive and super efficient. When you add to that, the CTV is driven by nearly 100% authentication. It lends itself to just highly personalized content in a way that no other channel has to deal with, whether we are talking about in the mobile environment where IDs are under pressure, in part because of Google and Apple or in the browsing web for the same reason, we are – in CTV, we have authentication nearly all the time. Additionally, because of those UIDs, we also have the opportunity for retail to do exceptionally well and all of that puts pressure on walled gardens in the open Internet now poses as a very viable alternative. So, whether we are talking about CTV, whether we are talking about retail, whether we are talking about the economic environment and pressure that, that puts on walled gardens to want to welcome incremental demand. All of that points towards an ecosystem, where more and more of them are considering bringing down the walls even the largest of them so that they can welcome incremental demand. And certainly, an environment like this is where you are most likely to see some of those changes. So, there is lots of activity considering that sort of stuff. And I do believe you will see announcements in 2023 suggesting more and more walls coming down. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Youssef. Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Vasily Karasyov at Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Good morning. Jeff, can you please talk in more detail about the forward always on Connected TV event you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then connected to that, can you talk more about the – your forward market product that you mentioned today? And also, I think you spoke about it a couple of quarters ago. That seems like a very interesting product. And of course, fighting the upfront market is a pretty gargantuan task that you are undertaking here.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, Vasily first, I really appreciate the question. You are right. The upfront market is huge. But I see that as an opportunity, one, because it of course, adds to the TAM, but also because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the upfront market hasn’t changed since 1962, much. And really it’s a shame that it hasn’t changed because the way the upfronts work today is that you can’t really bring data to the table. And so CTV is in a very interesting position right now, which is that it has been getting a premium largely because their scarcity. So, consumers have moved into CTV, into on-demand, over the Internet content. But as they have moved, the number of ads available for advertisers to put in front of those consumers hasn’t gone up nearly as quickly as consumers have moved over. So, that’s created a scarcity premium for all the ads. But we are seeing more and more inventory come online. And so some of the biggest content owners in the world are having to find ways to make the efficacy justify those prices instead of scarcity. And that’s part of the reason we talked about that the amazing case study with Disney, where they talked about 12x more effective as a result of using UID2 than alternative means of personalization that what is absolutely required to bridge that gap between what was coming from scarcity and now being provided via efficacy. And so of course, CTV is getting more effective. But if you don’t bring that same level of data to the upfronts, then you are going to miss out on almost half of television. So, what we have designed is an always-on forward market, which is essentially just a new version of the upfronts. But in this case, we are using technology to make it so that you can bring data to the table. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis. And when I say always on, the upfront is done once a year. You think about commodities and equities markets, those markets are on all the time. It doesn’t really make sense to only do it one week a year. And there is an opportunity for advertisers and content owners to constantly be evaluating the value of entering a commitment so that you can either get a discount or be assured that you are going to sell all of your inventory. I believe that’s going to be an important role in TV, the same – or in CTV, the same way that it was in traditional television. But we need a product that brings data to the table. Otherwise, it cannot justify the high CPMs that everyone has become accustomed to in CTV. And of course, advertisers aren’t going to pay high CPMs that the efficacy isn’t there. There is no way to bring all the best parts of digital to the table, leveraging the upfronts the way that they have existed to-date. So, we are very excited about it. We don’t think that we have to compete with anything other than a 1962 product. And because of our super low, I think we are in a really phenomenal position.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Vasily. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, can you talk about the opportunity to go direct to publishers with OpenPath and just broadly the benefits to the publisher, the advertiser and then Trade Desk as you think about measurement, targeting and economics, so kind of this broad question on basically the pitch to everybody about OpenPath? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So thanks. I really appreciate the question because I don’t know that most understand what OpenPath is. And so I appreciate the opportunity to just clarify. And so from the very beginning of the company, we have been pretty obsessed with improving the supply chain. And as I mentioned in other forums, I often look at the biggest technology companies in the world and try to study them for what they have done successfully. And I find a lot of inspiration from Amazon in this, which is just, I think as a company, one way to define their success is just they obsess over supply chains, how do we make it more effective for the end consumer. And that’s exactly the same thing that we have been doing, both with the ad tech ecosystem. There are a lot of steps between advertiser and publisher that are unnecessary at times and are in some cases, unfair or that people are taking more in fees than they are adding in value. And ultimately, that is to the detriment of us and the advertisers and agencies that we represent. Often also on the sell side and in the exchanges, there can be an auction that is unfair. I mean to some extent, that is exactly what the Department of Justice is filing suit against Google for an unfair auction dynamic. So, what we have been trying to do is to create a supply chain that is fair and transparent and competitive. We found in our discussions with publishers and content owners that often they are as frustrated as we are with the supply chain, and say, why can’t we just integrate directly. So, we made it very clear to the market, especially to SSPs that we are not interested in competing with SSPs. We are not interested in doing the yield management for publishers. But when a publisher wants to do their own yield management, we are happy to integrate with them directly so that together, we can ensure that the auction is fair and that the pipes are clean. And as a result, we also think that not only will we clean up the supply chain and make certain the fees aren’t extracted where they shouldn’t be, but we will also have greater transparency, and that will actually create better CPMs because efficacy will go up. So, this is especially important when we are talking about connected television in part because so many of the content owners have purchased SSPs, and so most of them own it. So, they have already made the decision to get in the business of yield management. So, we are extremely excited to be integrating with some of the largest. We have talked a lot about our partnership with Disney, and that’s in part because Disney, I think represents the largest amount of CTV ads anywhere on the Internet currently, meaning owned by one company. And with their commitment to both UID2, but as well as to integrating with us directly, we think that that sets the tone and the pattern from what will happen to everyone else. Of course, we have announced our partnerships on UID2 with CBS and Paramount Plus, and Disney and some of the others, but that lays groundwork for us and then continue to do the same on OpenPath. There is a long to publishers, not just in CTV, but in other channels that have also signed up with OpenPath. And we think that represents the start of a much cleaner supply chain in the open Internet. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, we saw a recent piece from the Head of Media, Bush, talking about her preferences for PMP deals within CTV versus programmatic guaranteed. She said because it helps me manage reach and freak across CTV destinations better, i.e. decisioning. But what trends are you seeing there? Are marketers shifting from programmatic guaranteed and saying we need reach and frequency control? And what’s the marketer kind of makes that step down the decisioning path, do they tend to use more of what you offer in terms of expressiveness and personalization and getting into kind of open auction environments?\\nJeff Green: First of all, thanks for the question. Second off, super impressed with how well you understand the business. That’s just implicit in the question is just a deep understanding of what’s going on in the space. You are spot on. The premise of your question is spot on, which is that inside of programmatic guarantee, you don’t have the same amount of decisioning as an advertiser. And so it means that you are often giving up your choices in terms of what you buy, and you are getting up your ability to control reach and frequency and just other things, which to me, doesn’t make a lot of sense. In equities markets, you wouldn’t necessarily just hand over all decisioning. If you are a portfolio manager, you want to make your own decisions. So, you want to decide what you are going to buy. And that’s exactly the people that we are appealing to. Those are the people you are talking about that are in highs [ph]. There are people who want to make decisions about what they are buying and selling and especially because if you are going to pay a premium, you want to make certain that you are controlling reach and frequency. And in fact, the math just doesn’t work, if you are not controlling reach and frequency, then the premium that you are paying to PMC TV is no longer justifiable. And so the math is putting decel towards using and leveraging more decisioning, but also just people wanting to be more effective, that’s the way that they had the most amount of control. And we are seeing more and more of the move towards PMCs and just anything that is fully decisioned. So, PMCs are going to present the most common way that that happens in CTVs and whether those PMCs are initiated by us or others really doesn’t matter. What is most important is that the advertisers themselves and/or their agency representing them, have a full decision in where they decide to put the ads. And when they have that, that’s where CTV is at its best. That’s where digital is at its best.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Brian. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mark Zgutowicz at The Benchmark Group.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Good morning guys. Jeff, just curious how much of your 4Q revenue you would attribute to UID2? And what do you expect that number to look like in – for the year? And then how many of the large pub UIDs that you are talking about are activated in your auction? And then separately, curious what you expect Apple will do with private related this year and what Google will do with its ID over the next, call it, 24 months and how that may impact ROEs on your data graph? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, the first part of the question is pretty hard to answer in terms of how much of it came from UID2. And that’s in part because, of course, we use UID2 that then leverages the graph. And in that graph, it’s still of cookies and lots of other identifiers that we lean on for now and in some cases, won’t be there in the future. But we of course, could deduce the same thing with just slightly lower statistical confidence and still have lots of room to provide personalization across the Internet. So, we don’t really know how it’s impacting it until it’s not there. But UID2 continues to grow at a rapid pace. And it often is the connected tissue between all of those other things. And then when you couple the fact that in Q4, only about 15% of our data – our third-party data had UIDs associated with it, and we expect that to be over 70% in the first half of this year. There will be dramatic upticks in what’s happening with UID2, and it gets rid of much of the matching problem, but we did see large upticks in the use of data in the second half of the year, largely because of UID2. So, it’s hard to quantify, but in terms of the total revenue impact. But in terms of impressions and data that are leveraging that, it’s just substantial. It’s a substantial part of our business today. So, this is a huge driver for our business now. And every day that those buy is becoming more and more of the case. I am sorry, these are being leveraged more and more as time goes on. And in fact, our OpenPath initiatives as well as our initiatives to just get closer to publishers and SSPs in 2023, the IDs and global placement IDs are being adopted around the Internet. As it relates to Google’s ID, there is a bunch of different Google IDs. Of course, there is a single sign on. Of course, there is the Android ID, which there is a lot of discussions about in the future. And then of course, there is cookies. All of those are largely in the control of Google. One thing I think Google has done well on most of these is they have given announcements and said we are going to do this years from now. And some of those dates are end of 2024. So, we are talking about 2 years from now. I think it’s reasonable to expect that part of the reason why Google is putting timelines out like that. And so that they can see what happens with things like the Department of Justice litigation, they want to see how the dust settles. And they are kind of between a rock and a hard place as it relates to protecting privacy, but also guarding against antitrust pressure. So, I actually don’t think it’s in Google’s best interest to make those all go away. What I love about and some of the things that they have said publicly on this specific issue is that they have to consider the impact on the Internet – really on the open Internet and all the publishers that they support and especially with the amount of scrutiny that they have right now on the antitrust side. I am not sure that it’s ever in their interest to see those go away from the open Internet. But I think another way to look at it is that we are just hoping that things like UID2 to go really, really well and it takes some pressure off of them. So, it sort of goes back to the one way or another, things are going to get better. And I think with the pressure that Google is facing right now, I think that’s more true than ever.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Mark. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Laura Martin at Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey there. Jeff, tactically on the DoJ, so it’s 150 pages of how Google has been abusing their clients. My question is, have all the smart clients that could leave Google already come to The Trade Desk, or do you feel that in 2023, you are going to be getting incoming calls now that their clients have read this 150 page really draconian treatment of clients. So, do you benefit from that in the near-term? And then secondly, UGC, so I agree with you on the walled gardens. You have been writing that a long time that walled gardens are losing share to the open Internet. UGC, it’s the first time I have heard you talk about that. And I guess I hadn’t thought about it because I was thinking TikTok was taking share from the two big guys, meaning YouTube and Meta. Could you go more into why you think UGC is losing share to the premium because I don’t really understand that one?\\nJeff Green: Sure. So, on the first part of the question related to the Department of Justice and their litigation against Google and will that benefit The Trade Desk and our clients coming to us as a result, I definitely think that, that will continue. As you know, we have great relationships with most of the largest advertisers in the world. So, I wouldn’t say that there are not many that are extremely large that would move over that hadn’t already done something with us. But there are some that are changing the politicians, if you will. So, meaning they are doing less with Google and doing more with us. So, I do think that there is an opportunity for that to be positive for us, but pretty early to tell. As it relates to the UGC side, so – and why I think there is a change happening with UGC and more moving to premium. Let me just explain a little bit what I think is happening with the economics. And a lot of this comes back to UID2. So, because of the pressures that are being put on identity across the Internet, there is even more premium that is heading towards connected television because it’s nearly 100% authenticated. So, because of that 100% authentication that does enable personalization that is not likely to be changed or controlled by any one company. There is enough fragmentation whether you are looking across operating systems, or whether you are looking across content owners. And of course, you have to log-in with an e-mail address almost every time to watch content. So, that enables a level of personalization and pushes people towards the open Internet. While at the same time, UGC is having more supply than ever. And with less personalization and less control coming from advertisers, there is just a more stark contrast between what’s available in CTV and what’s available in UGC. Said another way, there is finally a viable, scaled alternative to massive UGC platforms that now make it. So, it’s not quite – it doesn’t give the same luxury to be draconian in those UGC platforms as you could be elsewhere.\\nLaura Martin: Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks. And Holly, we have time for one more question.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Salmon at New Street Research.\\nDan Salmon: Hey. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me. The take rate stayed in that consistent 20% range once again, ticked down a couple – a little bit in the last couple of years, picked back up again. You have talked about the balance of large and small clients driving that in the past. Is there anything different going on there? And I would be interested to hear just a little bit more about how your JBPs, or joint business plans, compare on a take rate business and if that’s an important variable as well? Thanks guys.\\nBlake Grayson: Maybe I will take a stab, Jeff, if you want to follow-on.\\nJeff Green: Okay.\\nBlake Grayson: So right, 2022 marked I think, the ninth of the year, where we have had really consistent take rate trends. If you look at our take rate data from 2014 to 2022 over that 8-year period, I think we went up 4 years and we went down 4 years. So, it’s really been very consistently right around that 20% figure. Some years, it goes up a little bit, some years it goes down a little bit. But the real important thing to note about the take rate is that while it’s been really steady, and I said this I think on the – in the prepared remarks. We have made massive improvements for our platform, right. We are shipping new products. We are adding new features. We are innovating for customers. And we are effectively passing that surplus to them so they can create value and then grow spend with us and then spin our flywheel. And I don’t think there is any reason why that historical range changes for the near future. And we continue to expect that we will make further improvements to the platform and the data marketplace. And the focus is always about grabbing share and thinking about margin dollars, not just margin percentage. And with respect on the JBP side, there are just a lot of facets that go into that. It’s not just like a rate conversation we don’t have. So, we are incentivizing data usage. We are incentivizing the omnichannel benefit that we have as a company. And so it’s really not any type of a drag because you look at our JBP as a percentage of our spend and it’s been growing pretty nicely. And we went through a little bit of that in our Investor Day presentation in late last year.\\nJeff Green: I guess the only thing that I will add is, I just want to underline a couple of really important points here. First, our take rate has gone up 3 years of the last 6 years, and it’s gone down 3 years last 6 years, stayed pretty much the same the entire time for a publicly traded company. Important to note that during that time, of course we really shipped a lot of software. And what I have always been focused on, and we talked about this during the IPO roadshow. We wanted to make certain that we were adding to consumer surplus. I mean by consumer surplus, we mean our users so that we are giving them more and yet the price is essentially staying the same. I think we have done that over time, and that’s partly why our client retention rate has been so high and the satisfaction of our clients has been so high. We expect to continue to add to that consumer surplus that we want to make certain that our clients want to say. We believe that, that is the definition of economic sustainability to provide more value than you extract and we have been doing that over time. There is always a desire to try to figure out what are all the drivers of the take rate and what makes it go up and down. There is a lot of complex things, whether it’s about channel mix, whether it’s about geographical mix, whether it’s about size of clients, there is a whole bunch of things, also the use of data. But I think the single biggest contributor in 2022 to any change in take rate was largely just the way the data marketplace changed. And I expect changes in 2023 to continue to affect that. But we are always going to be looking for ways to keep that take rate essentially the same and increase the consumer surplus so that we spend the flywheel because at the end of the day, we are trying to grab land.\\nDan Salmon: Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you guys.\\nChris Toth: Holly, we can close the call.\\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

       " Document(page_content=\"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth : Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.  In particular, our expectations around the impact of the recent pandemic on our business and results of operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions or other macro events that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to our risk factors referenced in our press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green : Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future. Our performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment. We now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives such as Connected TV, Shopper Data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us. As a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Group's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic in part because of the combination of our exceptional 95% plus retention rate and our significant growth rate. There are macroeconomic forces, which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also gives me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show out. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV. In fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lot of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient. So first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean we've used cookies as a make-shift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique community to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. The open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers. With this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers. UID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each Web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress. In terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it. Let me give you one quick example, which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like the Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a comScore top 5 lifestyle media platform with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.  MediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now. Momentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages, simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will [crater]. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2 with many already reporting strong CPM growth. The ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2. AppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet. We also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for Web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium. In the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today. In order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt. The CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still an opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability while significantly upgrading consumer privacy. And new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content.  Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments like CTV we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy. So in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement, partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants. There is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I'd like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it. Already, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair-step increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future. Related to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I'd like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies. I do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return. For example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters, the Washington Post, Gannett, Conde Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others, McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hearst Magazines and Newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle, the Tribune Group and several others. In the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including the L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet. As more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers. For those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment. Let me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers. On a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDB TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by Discovery Plus leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic. A tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted in mass to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them. For consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera.  In the past, nearly all channels have had ads. Now once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely set up a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further. It's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression. In all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day. HBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs. For CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience. CTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models like upfronts and even programmatic guarantees where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets. As advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers. With the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video in all of its forms has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content. We work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it. And we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply. Not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets. Premium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV. And so you'd think they'd be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content. It's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. An advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies. The Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data. As the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward. As I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers. Our profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 started out strong with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. Solimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster. We are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up. With the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend, and audio represented about 5% of spend. Geographically, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1. We did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and food and drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1, and free cash flow was $136 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. I am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business with significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment. I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Shyam Patil from SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the results. I had a couple of questions. First one, Jeff, when we look at your results and your outlook, they look a lot better than what we’ve seen from a lot of other ad-funded companies during earnings. Can you just talk about what you think is driving your outperformance? And then second question, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rest of the year shaping up?\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Shyam. Appreciate it. So I – as I look at the outperformance for this quarter, and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter, it’s hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I don’t know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course, we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. It’s just a very exciting phenomenon. But I’m also just very encouraged by the fact that, of course, there’s macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course, the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment, what we’ve historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where they’re going to spend money, and they become very data-driven in the choices that they’re making. And in our case, that means they’re spending more with us. So I’m just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're –we’ve seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year, which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising, especially from the global players of CTV, I think it really sets up the second half of the year for – around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think we’re seeing even more of now. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year, we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP who’s just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Target’s media company, Roundel. So to have Walgreens, Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement, just unbelievable. But just again, nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then, of course, in the second half of the year, we’re also going to have a midterm election. From recent events, that seems to be one that’s going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think it’s – we’re very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So we’ll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words, we’ll move everything over to Solimar, the platform that we shipped on July 7, 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for, but now we’re extremely confident that we’ll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath, but we didn’t mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed, L.A. Times, Forbes, MediaVine, Red Ventures, which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others, have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second – or to the remainder of the year, say, second half, but to the remainder of the year.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Two, if I can. Jeff, 3 to 4 years ago, you were already on the strong opinion or the strong belief that Netflix has to offer an ad-supported model. That was just a matter of time. How do you feel about your chances of potentially partnering with Netflix around that opportunity and – or the potential risk of Netflix potentially building its own DSP, Amazon? And Blake, Q2 EBITDA implies a pretty big sequential and year-on-year drop, I think, to that 33%. Can you maybe just flesh out the biggest areas of investments and whether there is a typical kind of conservative built into that or – and just how should we think about that for the remainder of the year?\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. Great. So you’re right, I’ve been saying for more than half a decade that I believe that Netflix will eventually have to show ads. And that’s really based on the fact that I believe that consumers want choice. And that while Netflix has done a phenomenal job of preserving an amazing experience for consumers that at some point, that becomes cost prohibitive because you have to just keep raising prices, that is exactly what’s happened over the years. And they’re now at a place where I believe they will benefit from offering that choice. I think they have more pressure on them. Because of that history, I believe they have more pressure on them to create an amazing ad experience than anybody in the streaming competition, if you will. It’s partly because of that, that – you may know, David Wells, who was the previous CFO of Netflix joined our Board almost 5 years ago. So we’ve had a great relationship with Netflix because of him, and I’m extremely optimistic in the potential for us to partner with Netflix. One thing that you should know – and Youssef, you – I think you put just words to something I’ve heard from a few other people as well is why wouldn’t Netflix build this themselves? So what most advertisers are trying to do, they are trying to manage what we call reach and frequency. Like how often do I show the same ad to the same consumer across apps and channels? And so if I just control how many times I show an ad on station 112 and then just control how they can they show an ad separately on station 114, and those 2 things don’t talk to each other at all, you can waste a lot of money and show a lot of repetitive apps. This is why in traditional television, there’s a lot of repetition. It’s also why the ad break has so many ad in that. If Netflix were to provide an ad experience that have lots of repetition, in order for them to make the money that they need, they would have to show lots of them because the CPMs will be lower because they’re less effective, which creates more repetition, and you get into that unfortunate cycle that I believe has happened in traditional television. The sure is way out of that is for them to partner with an objective independent DSP that manages reach and frequency and budgeting across all the fragmented pieces of streaming so that we can provide the very best ad experience for everybody because we’ll be paying the highest prices, because of the fact that it’s so much more efficient or effective. So I’m very optimistic that we’ll be able to create partnership with every major streaming company in the world, including Netflix. The fact that we have a phenomenal relationship with Discovery, and therefore, also Time Warner and HBO, we have great relationship with them. We have a fantastic relationship with Disney. We partnered for years with Peacock and with Paramount and so many others. Of course, I had the expectation that we’ll do the same thing with Netflix.\\nBlake Grayson: And Youssef, to follow up on your question on the EBITDA for Q2. Just to frame it up, I’m really happy with our situation and where we are. Like we mentioned on last quarter’s call, we do expect in 2022 to increase the pace of our investment as we focus on the long-term growth of our business. And that’s got a support from a very strong business model that produces strong free cash flow and has a really, really solid balance sheet. Our Q2 forecast reflects that. It includes accelerating hiring across the business, particularly in engineering, business development and account management roles that really play a huge factor in driving our long-term growth. We also expect our in-office expenses to start ramping this year to prepandemic levels. And we also anticipate hosting more employee events to get the team together. But in terms of this year, Q1 EBITDA was very strong. I’m comfortable with our EBITDA trajectory and where things stand over the remainder of the year. And like we said last quarter, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic. And as I’ve always said, this business is really built for and I’m really optimistic about driving meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow as we scale. So I think that lots of great opportunities in front of us, and I feel pretty good about it.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Swanson from RBC Capital.\\nMatt Swanson: I’ll add my congratulations on the quarter. Jeff, maybe staying on the theme of CTV and Netflix. You mentioned still having an abundance or maybe an overabundance of demand for CTV. Well, with the upfront is coming up, could you maybe give us an updated view on the supply-demand curve, especially for premium CTV content? And how you think about the addition of Netflix and Disney+ with all that content coming online and whether or not we’ll see lower CPMs? And then I guess as was kind of a follow-up. Jeff, you mentioned that obviously, you saw Netflix coming from a long term – a long time away. When we think about the maturity curve now, though, for any subscription model hitting that threshold of payers, do you think this is going to change how new products launch from here on out when they see a Disney and Netflix and HBO Max all leading ads? Is – are we going to see any subscription-only products still get launched?\\nJeff Green: First of all, I appreciate the congratulations. We’re extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction, most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first, let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And it’s in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and you’re paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result, when you’re adding new inventory, it’s desperately needed. There’s demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what I’anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that they’re, of course, in order to continue subscribers, which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers, which is the way they’re all graded, they have to have a great ad experience. They can’t alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance, and they have to provide very few ads. So that means we’re going to see scarcity for a while, for as far as we can see in the future, honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious – as obvious to everyone, so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that we’re just SVOD, I don’t think it’s strategically smart for anybody who’s just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. It’s like any product where over time as it evolves, if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesn’t have features that rivals the iPhone 13, and instead, it rivals the features of iPhone 1, you’re just not going to be competitive. You’ve got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that, that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: I have a couple, if I may. One on Europe. You said in the prepared remarks that spend did slow down around the start of the war in Ukraine, but then recovered in April. So can you tell us your thought maybe in more detail about what the advertising environment is in Europe right now and where it’s going in your view? The second question is about political. You did make some comments on it, but wanted to see if you could give us more detail. So broadcasting companies have been reporting, and they’re saying that they see a record political cycle spending so far. So can you tell us, please, how you feel you are positioned? And do you think this could be some incremental revenue growth this year from political?\\nJeff Green: Yes. Sounds great. I’m going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them, and then I’ll also take time with both of them. So Blake?\\nA –Blake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So with regards to Europe, just first to put into context, historically, our growth has been driven by the very strong position we have in the U.S. Europe represents a single-digit share of our spend. CTV has been the primary driver behind our growth in the U.S., but European CTV also gaining share. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about that more than doubled – they grew in the triple digits in Q1. We did see more of that gap – of a gap between North America and international in the second half, but it did – it recovered a bit in April and recovered back to what we were seeing in January. But there is still some room to improve. I think that, that’s not a surprise, I think, for people who follow the space. The thing I think about when I think about opportunities like that is when customers become more deliberate with spend and they focus on the most efficient investment opportunities, that’s when The Trade Desk tends to shine because from my perspective, we proved it out in the second half of 2020 when we saw that as people needed to be more deliberate, they were focusing on the areas of investment that have the highest ROI, then they were consulting with us, and it worked out actually quite well in our favor. So I’m super optimistic about that. With regards to political, yes, it’s a great opportunity for us, and we’ll see how this ramps up because it’s going to probably start ramping up for us over the summer into November, obviously. You’ve seen reports that talk about midterm election spend on par or better than the 2020 presidential elections. The one thing I would encourage you to think about as you go through the forecasting is that seasonality is going to be different than we saw in 2020, so you’ll need to take that into account. There’s still a lot of factors to consider like the number of competitive races out there and stuff. But we do believe we’ve set ourselves up to be the kind of go-to platform for this political advertising versus maybe social media platforms and such. And we’ll have more color on this as we progress in 2022, more in the second half of the year, but definitely look forward to some tailwinds there. And then whatever, Jeff, you want to add on top.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. I’ll just add a little bit more color. So first, I’ve been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months, and that’s in large part because there’s just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets, we’re seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadn’t embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players, we’re seeing them move relatively quickly, which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where there’s pauses or there’s – I’ve seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA, the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So I’ve got both of the trips in the last 4 months, more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks, which is when there’s some economic pressure or they have to do more with less, they become very data-driven, and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And that’s exactly what I’m seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political, I’ll just underline what Blake said on – the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But I’ll just say lastly, on the political, we – I’m really proud of what we’ve proven in the last couple of election cycles, which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way, there’s room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums, including, in some cases, in social. So we’re really excited about what we’ve proven in the past and believe that we’ve set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: I’ll just ask one. Just want to focus back on CTV. So for a very long time, Google wanted to get into this, and the media companies don’t want them basically doing programmatic CTV. While they let them do YouTube TV, right, that YouTube isn’t doing the ads. And we’ve seen media companies try to own technology assets – ad tech assets and have not been good at it. And I guess, Jeff, your perspective, I mean, given what we’ve now almost seen as kind of like the undoing of some of the media mergers, where there’s like a clear idea that content owners need to be content owners and maybe just be the best of that because it’s so competitive, just how do you see how that kind of impacts your space on the board, and ultimately, to be potentially like the default partner to help the media companies with this transition?\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I think your assessment sort of that’s built into your question is spot on. I just – I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think it’s really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disney’s, of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think that’s somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think it’s just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space, being one of, and in many cases, the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world, and they’re leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. It’s just really incredible. And that’s largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We don’t own any content. We are constantly – well, publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain, but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think that’s the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are, to some extent, doing the exact same thing, they – even companies like that, that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because we’re all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything, right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic, especially in the intersection of media and tech.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\\nBrent Thill: Maybe if you can give us a quick update on Walmart and any critical milestones that you’ve had and how you look at that through the second half of ‘22.\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. Yes. If there’s any topic that didn’t get its due, it’s – I don’t know, it’s a rival between our data marketplace and our shopper marketing efforts. And so as I did mention, though, we just finished our first full quarter with Walmart. We saw over 200 advertisers. These are all very large brands – provide test budgets during that time. We expect even more large brands and more expansion as we continue forward. And we think that this is going to be just an amazing growth driver over the next 5 years. We, of course, saw some early tests and some amazing results from CPGs, as you might expect. But I don’t know that enough has been said about what is being done by companies like Walgreens and Target and Drizly, and this Target’s division Roundel because what they’re largely doing is really changing the way measurement works in CPG and really anything that’s primarily built – I’m sorry, bought off-line because what it makes possible is the ability t’ measure from the –me’you show the ad to the time somebody buys the product and measure that end-to-end using retail data instead of a walled garden or technology companies sort of grading their own homework data. And so by having that collection there, we now put together this mosaic that really creates this amazing marketplace that we even call the measurement marketplace for anybody that’s selling products that are largely bought in those stores. And then, of course, those stores spin their flywheel faster. So the green shoots are fantastic. We’ve merely scratched the surface, but we’re very excited about the start that we’ve had and very excited about our partnerships with Walmart, Walgreens and Drizly, Roundel, and GoJet and Flybuys and so many others. I’m not even listing half of the internationals, but very excited about all the progress.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, I was just hoping you could maybe define what you consider the large publisher market in terms of having, I guess, the majority of loyal signed-in users and how many you think you need to sign on to UID2 for your platform to come close to replacing cookie scale, when and if Google shuts down cookies? And then just in terms of UID2, what's the status on finding an administrator for UID2, and particularly the importance of that in Europe? Appreciate answers to those.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users, it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on, but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept, there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in, in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly, this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general, we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in, in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much, much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?\\nMark Zgutowicz: Yes. So I was just wondering if you – what the progress is on finding an administrator for UID2? By administrator, meaning somebody who’s willing to accept liability for violations of GDPR.\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. So because of the fact that – so first, there’s a European issue, and then there’s the administrator issue in other parts of the world as well, including in the United States. The position that we’ve taken so far is that we wanted to make UID2 an open source project so that it was available to everybody and sort of administering or managing that code base so that it could be available to everybody was the most important first order of business. And that we’ve done with the IAB, and we’ve done that based here in the United States, but it’s available everywhere in the world. As it relates to administration of its operation, because essentially, you’re handing over control at that point, it’s a double-edged sword. You can hand over a liability. You can also hand over some of its future. That’s something that we want to be very certain is good and secure before we hand that off. So we’re in no rush to do that, whether that’s with [IV] in the United States or any entity in Europe. And because in Europe, everybody is essentially taking some amount of risk if you take on the role of controller. So I don’t believe that it’s an effective way to distribute or mitigate risk at this point. So there’s nothing – we’re in no rush to do that. And instead, what we want to make certain that we do, especially in Europe, but really everywhere around the world, is develop a system that can scale and make sure that early on, we partner with companies that we believe are being responsible, that are doing the right thing and that we establish very clearly the quid pro quos and opt-outs that are in compliance with GDPR. And we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant ID in the world, but we will make it interoperable with others that we believe are also doing the right thing, and that’s going to create a better Internet, one that I think is really important for Europe and optimistic that we’ll continue to see scale. But we’re much more early days in EUID than we are in UID2 because there’s just a lot more things to consider and a much more political environment. So I’m just excited of the progress at this point.\\nOperator: The final question will be from Michael Morris from Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: I’ll try to squeeze in 2 final questions. The first one is on the pretty consistent comment that you made, Jeff, about The Trade Desk being the default DSP for the open Internet. Obviously, this implies potential for a pretty universal adoption across buyers. So I’m curious if you can elaborate on where you are now in terms of partner penetration. You referenced over 1,000 customers. But any frame of reference or what that means for full penetration, sort of how that’s been trending would be helpful. And the second question is a little bit of elaboration on the impacts of Netflix and other peers introducing these global ad-supported businesses, which are pretty new to market, of course. Does this drive an acceleration in your investment internationally? Any other kind of fundamental changes that this makes to the industry?\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. So as it relates to partner penetration, I’m trying to think of the best way to quantify it. In general, I believe that we have only scratched the surface. I’m sometimes referencing last year, we had over $6 billion flow through the platform, but we’re still looking at a nearly $1 trillion TAM in terms of what’s spent in total global advertising. So we’re still just merely scratching the surface and a tiny amount of what’s possible. When you look at how many of those dollars are spent in the Fortune 500, while we’re very encouraged by what we’ve done inside of the Fortune 500 among the biggest advertisers, when you become the default for them and learn how to support the most sophisticated in the world, of course, it then gives you room to do similar things for midsized businesses, midsized agencies as we’ve always supported agencies. We continue to expand among – more and more midsized agencies, and that’s giving us a wider variety of clients, which is why we added so many advertisers both directly and through agencies in Q1. So I think this was a quarter where we added more to the sort of quantity of advertisers and agencies than we usually have. But it then tees up the opportunity for us to then get a greater share of wallet where I think there’s just still way more upside than sort of dollars we already have. You asked if the – the expansion that we’re seeing, especially from these global CTV players, if that will increase our investment around the world. I do think it will. Maybe not immediately, but I believe that investment will happen in the coming months and quarters. And that’s largely because it’s difficult to pay for a subscription and avoid the ads. Like in the prepared remarks, I made that reference or the analogy to traditional television where it’s really a luxury to pay for a station that doesn’t have any ads. It costs more. And so if you think about most markets outside the United States have a median household income that is lower than the United States. And so as a result, most of them would prefer to pay by seeing ads than by paying a premium. And especially if you’re fighting like hell to go get more subscribers, that becomes the very best way for you to grow in new markets. Incidentally, advertisers also love that, especially when you’re looking at places like Asia, but even some of the markets in Europe, where there’s just such a growth of middle class not to – occur – or occurring right now that just is a great time to advertise when people’s wealth is growing for the first time to levels that give them sort of unprecedented purchasing power. So I definitely think that will result in investments from us around the world. And I do think it will change the CTV landscape around the world to have companies that were historically U.S. companies that continue to become more of a force internationally. And I think ad-supported business models will make them stronger competitors around the world, not weaker.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference.

       " Document(page_content='Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Trade Desk’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today from our Singapore office are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I am thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it’s been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth and it’s always inspiring to spend time here, more on that later, but first, on to our results. As you have seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled gardens in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment. Our vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found as we have predicted CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet, when possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren’t comparable to others. In short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever, because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side roadmap and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street. Because of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JBPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JBPs position the Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JBPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media, whether it’s decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising. With this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing. WPP’s GroupM predictive worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022 and we are growing at more than 3x that rate. CTV continues to be a key growth driver and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it’s only our third full quarter total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3. As we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk and more of the world’s leading retailers are also now following suit. The chorus of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet, while CTV maybe the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second. Political also continues to perform well. Mid-term election – over mid-term election, we have exponentially grown our business. We are proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides. With all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I’d like to touch on three areas. First is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet even in a volatile macro environment; second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value; and last is the critical mass of support that is growing around Unified ID 2.0. And why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet. So first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens. You only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world’s largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, “it is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend. That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.” Back in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hint of uncertainty. But what you are hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world everyday now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world’s most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform. We provide objective transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance and we provide access to the world’s most advanced data marketplace including many of the world’s biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals. We recently ran a campaign for Clarence, one of the world’s largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the UK. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multi-channel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement. As a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest. For years now, we have been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I will make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I have said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets like the UK and France are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category. Let me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C-class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets. ViewSonic is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets such as India, the Philippines, Germany and UK. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign. Back in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year, with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets. Our success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV. Not enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators who have long histories in advertising and what they are doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers’ experience. Peacock is one of our longest standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I am thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance. UID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let’s remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There is nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns. One of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo and the results they have seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad-spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform. The adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have. One of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world’s leading data aggregators such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world’s leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without it ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year, will be UID2 tag. With more and more of our publishers’ inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year. With this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year, because we have done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision, and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond. I’d like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I have spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices such as Melbourne and New Delhi as we have benefited from new JBPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here. As I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That’s true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand. Many inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile, and of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia-Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead. To come back to where I started in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don’t often comment on competitor performance, I do think it’s worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we are gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform. I could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we have discussed today and we will continue to innovate to lead the market and I am confident that the world’s leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail. As our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double-digits, while many companies in the ad funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We have also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers and we are building trust with our clients for the long-term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We are seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI. Q3 was another example of our ability to grow top line while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long-term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I’m fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions. From a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we’re encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend. Despite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget. Every ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we’re starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company’s unbiased partnership with them and that we don’t own inventory, we don’t compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021. While uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Hi, guys. Nice job on execution. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you expand and talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing with the macro? And then separately, just how you see the setup as we go into next year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, could you just talk a little bit more about the 4Q guide and just some of your assumptions there? Thank you, guys.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the question. So let me first start with the macro and talk about this year. So I don’t know that I have ever been more proud of our performance than what we just put up in Q3. And that’s in large part because of the relative outperformance where most other stocks are either negative or reporting single-digit growth. We put up 31% and we’re doing that in an environment that is a little bit more uncertain. If there was an advertising mix, it would be at an all-time high and it’s hard to say whether that’s because of macro headwinds or mostly macro uncertainty, but it would be high because of one of those themes in each case. But because we’re definitely in an environment regardless of where that’s coming from, where advertisers have to do more with less, it means more that we’re winning share in this environment. And I definitely believe that we’re grabbing land. So I take a lot of comfort in what Procter & Gamble said in their earnings report, which is that we are actively shifting our spend from linear and non-targeting TV into programmatic and digital that is a lot more precise. And so when you look at just the overall macro environment, I just think we’re just doing so incredibly well on a relative basis, that it’s hard not to be proud, it’s hard not to look at what we’ve done and see grabbing land. But when you turn our attention to 2023, and you start to look at all the new inventory that’s going to come into CTV, whether that’s from Disney+ or digital inventory from Peacock or HBO or Netflix or Paramount Plus or Fox or ESPN or Hulu or the fact that we reported in earnings that this year 11 markets outside the United States outperformed in the United States in premium video or connected television. And then you look at the UID tailwinds that we have, we just surpassed 600 partners in UID and that we’re activating data at an unprecedented level. We are going to go from a minority of our – or I’m sorry, of our data on our platform being enabled by UID to the majority of our third-party data being enabled by the beginning of next year. So we’ll finish that work this year going from minority to majority. I do believe that in 2023, we will have the best data marketplace that the ecosystem has ever had. I think we will have the best first-party data onboarding that we’ve ever had. And that’s not even talking about OpenPath, which we didn’t really have time to talk about in our prepared remarks, which will be direct integrations with hundreds of the world’s largest content owners and that will accelerate our growth and land grabbing around the world irrespective of the macro environment in 2023. And of course, last but not least, with us partnering with over 80% of the largest retailers in the United States and of course, partnering with many all over the world, all of those trends point to an incredible opportunity for us in 2023, that wouldn’t be possible without the grabbing of land that we’re doing right now. So with that, I’ll pass it over to Blake to just talk a little bit more about the second part of your question.\\nBlake Grayson: Hey, thanks, Shyam, for the question. So your question on Q4, just to start off on Q3, again, fundamentally great quarter, actually pretty steady, too, which was great to see 31% revenue growth off a relatively hard comp last year of 39%. And political has ramped up for us as well. So like you’ve already seen standout performance versus peers who are growing at much smaller or negative rates, again, CTV led the way, still opportunity there. Shopper marketing is ramping up well for us, too. The Solimar adoption is exciting. We’ve got the momentum on UID as well. And so just grabbing share from company zone, and you’ve heard us talk about these JBPs as well. That’s also been ramping and has been strong. And so as you think about, as when we think about going into Q4 in our setup, again, relative to the rest of the industry in Q4, we’re growing significantly faster, which, in my mind, just confirms we’re grabbing share. Advertisers are be more deliberate. I just personally believe we’re in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID. As a Chief Financial Officer or CFO, I definitely appreciate the uncertainty that so many of my peers are facing right now, right? Like the best CFOs are actively working to rationalize the investments that they are making and they are prioritizing the ones that have proven measurable returns. And in that environment, The Trade Desk we gained share because companies are now prioritizing programmatic as the first place to invest that first dollar. So while you can obviously dial programmatic up and down quickly, it’s doing really well for us. And to me, that just shows the power and the value of this model. Now specifically with regards to Q4 a couple of thoughts, not only is our Q4 sequential growth well into the double digits as many app funded companies are flat or negative. We’re actually forecasting accelerating growth on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And I recognize that there’s a political impact in there. But when I just step back a bit and look at a year-over-year acceleration in Q4 in this environment, to me, that’s a standout performance for us and it gives us a lot of optimism about our future and the momentum that we’ve got. And I hope that helps.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First, maybe, Blake, can you talk about the – how you look at the expense structure for 2023, maybe talk about the puts and takes, growth versus the need to invest more? Do you expect margins to improve relative to where you are for – or will you end up in 2022? And Jeff, maybe going back to connected TV, very impressive kind of both numbers and color commentary. Can you maybe speak to the competitive positioning that you guys have relative to other CTV players? And do you believe that you are actually gaining share or losing share relative to other players that arguably are also benefiting from growth in CTV next year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Blake, first I’ll take the second and Tim, if you don’t mind, adding color after I deal on CTV.\\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Hi, Youssef, thanks for the question. So with regards to thinking about expense structure in 2023 and such I really just like stepping back a bit to remind everyone that the business model in the situation we’re in highly desirable, right? We’ve got a situation where we’re driving high top line growth. We’ve got high adjusted EBITDA growth with strong margins. And we’ve got not only strong free cash flow generation, but consistent free cash flow generation. So having all of those working together, which they are, it gives us an opportunity and ability to be deliberate with the choices that we make. I’m just also super proud of our ability to stay disciplined with our investments regardless of the operating environment. I – there’s a lot of companies out there that might have more resources than us that are pausing or even cutting their resources because they potentially invested too aggressively. And we didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. I think maybe like some of these companies did, and that’s paid off for us. We have the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and that includes hiring. As we think about 2023 specifically, should we see any significant changes in the situation, we definitely have levers available to make changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 during COVID, we can adapt. But still, the expense structure of the company today is better than it was pre-pandemic. But overall though, and I’ve said this on a number of calls, we’re always looking for ways to invest and drive growth that we think pays off for the long run. For 2023 specifically, I would say a couple of things. We do expect return-to-office expenses like travel and live events to return to pre COVID levels. And the other thing to keep in mind is I would expect seasonality of our expenses next year to be a bit more like 2016 to 2019 than they were in 2020, 2021. And just for example, we have our large company event that will finally move back to its regular timing in Q1, it was held in Q2 of this year. That’s just a great opportunity to bring our team together, especially after what’s gone on in the past few years, whether we’re solidifying our culture, framing our strategy versus the opportunity we’ve got. And also just highlighting, again, the discipline perspective we take as a company about driving profitable growth. So looking into 2023, I think we’re in a great position to drive more scale and efficiency and free cash flow. And we have so many opportunity areas to focus on. I’m really excited about that. And then...\\nJeff Green: I’ll start on CTV and then Tim if you want to speak to it as well. So I really think there’s two parts to talk about on the CTV question. The first is just talk about the category a little bit and then also to just talk about why we win specifically inside the category. So of course, right now, at The Trade Desk, we’re living a secular tailwind that I don’t know that we’ve ever seen before, and I don’t know that we’ll ever see again and that is going to continue into 2023, largely because of the amount of inventory that is coming online. But also as you look across the open Internet, and whether that’s inside of display or native or audio or any other channel because CTV is leading the way in forging the future of identity, CTV is not just leading in our business and not just the most interesting thing happening in programmatic, but it’s the most interesting thing happening in ad-funded media. And so as a result, CTV is the first – is quickly becoming the place where people spend their very first dollar and was not surprised at all to see our partner, Disney+ report 12 million new subscribers. And of course, Netflix added a couple of million themselves on just the promise of an ad-funded option coming soon. So there’s more inventory coming online, programmatic we’ll just continue to drive CTV. And I do believe that very soon, CTV will be the most data-driven channel. And that to me is one of the things to really just focus on in terms of why we’re winning inside of CTV. So why are we winning above everyone else. So in order to be competitive, you do have to be omni-channel. So you can’t just be focused on CTV because you take the data and the learnings from all other channels and then apply those to CTV where CTV is a top of the funnel activity where you’re typically creating awareness. And then all the other channels are follow-ups, if you will, to that really effective moving picture and sound that happens inside of CTV. And so in order to be most effective, you have to be holistic. So you have to be omnichannel, but you also have to be global and then very importantly, you have to be objective, which means you can’t compete with any of the content owners, which is one of the themes that is really a problem for most of the walled gardens, especially Google, which is that, of course, they have their own media in YouTube. And so content creators are not eager to part with somebody – or to partner with somebody that they compete with in their very – in the core of their business. So by being objective and not competing with them by being global, by being omni-channel and then there’s something that we say all the time to every content owner on the Internet, and that is that you have to have an authentication strategy and you have to have an identity strategy. And we’re able to go to the content owners and partner with them on both of those things. And you see this with Disney. Disney is doing extremely well. We’ve been very vocal. They have been very vocal about our partnership on UID. It is a part of their authentication and identity strategy. That is what makes personalized ads possible. That’s what makes high CPM as possible. That’s what makes low ad loads possible. So we become a really critical partner for them while not competing with them because we’re objective. You put all that together, and that’s the reason we’re winning. But I’m sure Tim, you can say more about this.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Youssef, thanks for the question. And as I look out next year and kind of why I think we’re differentiated and in a position to win, it’s a little bit of what Jeff said. So you’ve got a lot more inventory coming online. So as Jeff pointed out, we’ve got Disney+ and Netflix, they get a lot of the word count in the ecosystem right now. But let’s not forget, HBO Max, Paramount NBCU, Fox, the rest of Disney, Hulu, ESPN, ABC, etcetera are continuing to lean into programmatic. And the reason that they lean into us is if you think about it from their perspective, and they look back at the ecosystem of people who do what we do, a lot of those companies are competing with them. So they lean in heavily with us and they partner with us in a number of different ways, including on identity. So UID2, through our partnership with Disney, I think, is going to be a major catalyst for the CTV category. As a result, that inventory is going to have much richer decisioning going into next year across the entire category. So when I think about 2023, there’s this like perfect collision of addressability and scale in the premium content space that we’ve never seen before. And I think that’s going to be a huge benefit to The Trade Desk because it’s mostly to date in this CTV story. And I think in 2023, it’s going to be a programmatic CTV story. And so I’m really excited for that in 2023 because I think all of these things combining that addressability and that scale is going to create an environment for CTV to be the most data-driven channel in programmatic next year. And I am really excited for that. And as a result, I think CTV is going to very quickly become the first dollar spent in digital media, and I think The Trade Desk is well positioned going into next year.\\nYoussef Squali: Super helpful.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Laura Martin with Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey, Jeff, just following up on your comments about ID on connected television, the MAD data shows that 80% of viewing on connected television is shared does seem to undermine some of the targeting benefits that we had on individual devices like smartphones and tablets. That’s my first question. And then my second is China. You’re sitting in Singapore and you’re noticeably silent on China. So could you give us an update on what’s going on with China and your business these days? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Fantastic. Thanks, Laura. Really appreciate the question. So when it comes to shared viewing or the impact that, that has on CPMs or does it pose a threat to the ecosystem or is it a problem for CTV, let me just first sort of answer that emphatically, by saying it’s not a problem for the ecosystem whether you frame it is CTV worth it. The answer is yes. Does it have a frequency capping problem, the answer is no. The bottom line is when we are considering, targeting or customizing ads, there is an individual graph, there is a household graph. Both of those are considered when we are making the placement of ads and shared viewing doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s worth any less. And in fact, what we are competing with is an environment in linear or broadcast television that is almost always shared viewing, but it’s not measurable. So, finally, we have the ability to measure when it’s being shared and when it’s not. And of course, a lot of premium video is on personalized devices. And I have been reminded about it again and again this week as I am here in Asia and reminded how much premium video is consumed on mobile devices. So, household and individual graphs are both considered, but when you compare the sort of spray and pray a broadcast or traditional television, into the efficacy, the targeting, the identity-driven lower ad load with content that is more premium, you put all of that together, the impact on digital is exponentially more valuable than a linear broadcast and the efficacy has gone up way more than the cost. And as that phenomenon continues to unfold in 2023 that Tim was just describing really well, which is that it’s becoming a programmatic story where there is more inventory, and we can select more and more from the sort of wider selection of ads, the personalization, the customization, the efficacy is only going to continue to go up. So, it’s absolutely worth the shared viewing. I don’t even view as an issue. I don’t spend time thinking about it. So, as it relates to China, China is of course, one of the largest markets in the world, and we are constantly keeping our eye on the fact that while as a media market, it’s about half the size of the United States. It is growing at twice the pace. As you recall, last year, China was our fastest-growing office in the world. This year, that hasn’t been true, but that’s largely just because of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. So, we have been quiet, in large part because of those geopolitical issues and because there has been some slowdown. If the geopolitical issues weren’t enough, there is also COVID lockdown that has affected them in a very significant way. But we have been quarter-over-quarter, up over 100% in this environment. Shanghai is no longer our smallest office, which it was just 18 months ago. And we just – we continue to believe that while the English-speaking world has led much of CTV, the Chinese-speaking world is the second most important as it relates to the premium video play and that we continue to look at China and all the Chinese-speaking nations of the world as a very important battleground for the future of global television and premium video, so still excited and bullish just a bunch of things that make a fair amount of uncertainty. Thanks, Laura. Appreciate the question.\\nChris Toth: Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Two, if I can. Jeff, as you exit the year and have these data initiatives and OpenPath kicking in the year, how should we think about the competitive landscape and how that looks in 2023 versus what we have observed in the past? If I look at some recent commentary by Proctor & Gamble, it seems like there is a lot more programmatic budget and relationships up for grabs heading into next year. And then for Blake, I appreciate your color on the Q4 guide. Could you please put a finer point on some of the trends you observed quarter-to-date? And how we should think about growth over the rest of the quarter? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I think you are right in that. There is more and more budget that’s going into programmatic. I think the commentary that we have heard from Procter & Gamble is indicative of that. As you have heard us say before, the supply chains of the open Internet, but really the supply chains of the entire ad-funded Internet have become a little bit murky and as often happens when markets mature, become just much more complicated. So, it becomes more and more important for us to be obsessing about supply chains or supply pads. I have said before that I think one way to characterize the success of Amazon, it is that they have had an executive team that has just obsessed about the supply chain and just making certain that they are getting things as efficiently as possible so that they can deliver to their consumers the best product as fast as possible for the best possible price. We have applied that same sort of obsession to the media supply chain, which in some ways is even more complicated. And we have said, as often as possible, we want to make certain that no one in the middle is taking more in fees or tax than they are adding in value. And we do believe that, that happens a fair amount of time because of complication and because of sort of draconian tactics of some of the biggest tech players in the world. Our way of combating that is to release products like OpenPath, where we plug in directly with the biggest publishers in the world. We have had a number of conversations with content creators, whether that’s in CTV or in mobile apps or in traditional web development, where they have said they don’t feel like anyone is representing them the way they would like to and they would like to do their own yield management and plug in with us directly. That creates a more efficient supply chain, while us maintaining our role on the buy side as well as our objectivity. So, when you couple that with all the data initiatives going into 2023, and I have said in the prepared remarks that I believe because of Unified ID data, especially first-party data will be 10x more valuable in 2023 than it’s ever been historically. And that’s largely just because of the math of UID and the scale of UID and not having to sync like we did in cookies, not only is the Internet getting an upgrade because we are going from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet, but we are also getting rid of some of the clunkiness that cookies had, which makes a data-driven Internet just so much more effective. And of course, it’s better for consumers when it’s opt-in. You put all that together, we have a more effective supply chain. While budgets are up for grabs, we think that we are more likely to get the first dollar than anyone else. And what has happened over the most of the history of The Trade Desk is that we got the leftovers from search and social and the walled gardens. And what’s starting to happen now is we are getting the very first dollar, and that’s happening more and more. We expect that to continue as a secular tailwind that CTV continues. So, I appreciate the question.\\nBlake Grayson: And then, Justin, just on your question on the Q4 trend, one way maybe to think about it is, it’s a little bit of a tale of two cities like and you have heard us say this before, like or a cave shape recovery, if you will, for certain verticals. Some areas like travel and auto are outperforming and they are making up for lost time. Some areas are more challenged. You have heard us talk about Europe, but as we have said that before. But specific to Europe, as we have said, we have seen incredible CTV growth there, which is amazing in light of the macro challenges. So, it makes me super optimistic for the future for us there. And then the automotive growth, especially it’s been especially exciting to see some gains there. We have won new business and then some more existing from existing customers after a period of volatility over the past 2-or-so years. And so I think that – and then even if you talk about CPG companies, you got some that are doing incredibly well and then some that still have some supply chain challenges as well. So, I think that the breadth of the advertisers and the verticals that we represent bodes super well for us and like there is still areas of opportunity for us to gain share there, too.\\nJustin Patterson: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Justin.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Tom White at D.A. Davidson.\\nTom White: Great. Thanks. Given the elections here yesterday, I thought I would ask a question on political. Jeff, any big takeaways around political ad spend this cycle? Any learnings that we should kind of take away that you are taking away as to the future of political ad spend on CTV and I guess, just digital broadly? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, one thing that’s happened in the past is that we have seen them sort of focus on social and other parts of political. But what we have definitely seen this time is that CTV is the preferred channel for political advertisers, and it’s playing a larger role in every election cycle. One thing that is just really important for me to note is that as there has been more and more mistrust of specific tech platforms in the political environment, we are really proud of the work that we have done to focus on providing a better democratic process for both sides of the aisle and making certain that our platform is objective and independent so that we can power both Democrats and Republicans and anybody else for that matter. And I think our team has done a phenomenal job over really the last decade in winning trust and providing reassurance to both sides that we are going to provide them with an objective platform that’s going to make it possible for them to do the very best and sort of let the process do its thing. It’s our job to run a better process not to advocate for specific candidates or to get in the middle politics more specifically. And as a result of creating that arm’s length relationship, we once again believe we have run a better process and been a key contributor to running a healthy election. We expect that to grow in 2024 as we move into the next presidential cycle. But once again, CTV plays a very significant role, and we think it will play a bigger role in every election going forward. And we are really excited to see the election or election growth and expect that to continue into the future. So, I appreciate the question.\\nTom White: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Tom.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, I want to know if you could talk about your decisioning intensity in CTV maybe versus other channels, particularly in the context of private marketplace deals and things of that ilk. Do you do as much heavy lifting there versus other channels? And do you get pushed back on pricing and any differences in the intensity there and also in CPMs?\\nJeff Green: Yes. I appreciate the question, Brian. So, we have been asked some form of this question over time in various ways. And it’s essentially to say do we add less value in CTV, or should we be charging less? So, it’s – are just two different ways of asking that question. And I would argue that we add more value in CTV than we do in any other channel. And also the value that we are adding is going up over time. So, the first part of that is the reason why we are adding more value is because the stakes are higher. If you in the stock market, if you buy stocks at random or you buy them all in ETFs, they tend to go up over time. But if you buy ads at random, you will get your kicked every single time that you have to select very carefully. And in the world of CTV, when you are buying very highly expensive or high-cost impressions, the stakes are higher. You have to make certain that you use data to buy the right ones, you have to get reach and frequency right. And I would argue the only platform in the world that manages reach and frequency well on CTV is The Trade Desk. So, we add more value. And as time goes on, when you add more impressions, there is more opportunity to outperform and select more carefully. So, while there have been a series of PMPs or ways of buying and limited decisioning methodologies, those have gone down over time. And those are typically training wheels are on ramps for advertisers that over time are replaced with just high decisioning. And that’s where all of our biggest advertisers are heading. That’s where our product has done. And we think over time that we just continue to add more value for essentially the same cost as we do in everything else, but our take rate having remained the same, pretty much our entire existence as a publicly traded company. So, I think it’s something that has been important for us to clarify. And so I really appreciate the question, Brian.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks Jeff.\\nChris Toth: Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, just a UID follow-up, we have heard concerns that publishers are being slow to adopt UID. What can you do to speed up adoption? And how are you thinking about this? Do you agree? Do you disagree? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I am constantly reminded that if you sat me down a year ago and said Jeff, write up a dream list of adopters. I don’t think I could have fictionalized or made up a list that’s more impressive than those that we have actually added AWS, Salesforce, Snowflake, Adobe, you heard us saying a year ago that we needed to add the infrastructure of the Internet. And those and hundreds of others represent that infrastructure with now approaching 600 partners. And that doesn’t even underscore the entire infrastructure of the data ecosystem of the Internet, names like Experian or InfoSum or so many others. So, with all of those coming online and then you add the CTV players companies like Disney, who have adopted it, and it will be just really critical next year that all CTV players are leveraging UID in order to get the personalization and the high CPMs that they all desperately need to compete. When you put all that together, I actually don’t have any idea where that assertion is coming from that publishers are going slow. The only way that I could possibly make sense of that, just that some of them, it takes a little bit of time to prioritize and actually implement. But in terms of commitment or signing or prioritizing, it’s there across the board. And we have so much momentum on the issue that I honestly, a year ago wouldn’t have thought it’s possible for us to have the momentum that we have now. And I believe it’s just critical for companies, especially content owners to be leveraging that in order to do well. And you will see us in 2023 push really hard to enable advertisers to bring their first-party data to bear. And I do think that, that will represent a very strong rebuttal to the value propositions of walled gardens and the leverage of first-party data and their ecosystems. Because here, they will get to put their first-party data to work and then measure relative performance, learn from it, take the learnings with them so that they can continue to improve their marketing and not just outsource advertising and marketing to walled gardens, which has historically been the only option that they have had. So, UID plays a really critical role in the future of the open Internet, and it’s doing its job.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Let’s take one more question Holly.\\nOperator: Your final question for today is coming from Michael Morris at Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning guys. I have two topics I would like to ask about. One about the joint business plan momentum and one about Asia. So, on the first topic of the JBPs, I would love to hear how – if there is some way you could quantify or help us understand how much more valuable a partnership through a JBP is compared to sort of your run rate business or somebody, a partner who is not involved in one of those, how much value does it add? And also how penetrated is the market at this point for those? How much more runway do you feel you have with respect to the kind of addressable market for partners that are of this size that it makes sense for. So, that’s the first topic. And then the second just on Asia. Jeff, you did spend a lot of time talking about the opportunity there. The Asia-Pac market historically has been a pretty tough market for Western companies as they compete with local players. So, I would love to hear a little bit about why you think you can be successful where maybe some companies in the past have not? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thank you. I am going to have Tim take the first part of the question on the JBPs, then I will add some color and talk about Asia.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Michael, thanks for the question on the JBPs. I will kind of try to cover everything that you mentioned there. So, first, starting with what’s the difference between a JBP and a typical engagement. One of the major differences in the JBP is that these tend to be multiyear agreements between The Trade Desk and a brand or agency. And they tend to set kind of a partnership framework that often includes milestones for that partnership over that multiyear agreement, which is typically a longer period of time than a standard MSA that we would sign with a client. So, within that framework, typically the way that these work is that the advertiser, we sit down and we set goals for ourselves around things like how do we move more spend into the platform, how do we think about adjusting their investment mix moving it towards more data-driven advertising, how do we think about using platform features that they may be underutilizing. It’s a really great framework to structure how we build a stronger partnership with that brand or agency over a longer period of time. And one of the incredible benefits of that is it creates a lot of stickiness and engagement with our partners over that period of time because we are constantly checking in on achievement against those milestones. And I think the way that we look at those as just these longer term engagements is it really creates a lot of a deeper conversation with our partners so that we can really figure out how we are structuring these that are going to see the best interest of their business and how we can kind of jointly agree on what we are going to try to achieve together over a multiyear period. So, in the end, all that leads to a much more interesting and dynamic conversation and discussion over time. And we are really excited about the momentum that we have right now, and we are expecting to continue to build on that into the future with more JBPs with more clients.\\nJeff Green: Thanks Tim. Well, said, I don’t have anything to add on the JBPs. I am excited to weigh in on Asia, though, because I really appreciate your question. And of course, we are also all sitting here in Singapore and nearing our 10-year anniversary of being here in the Asia market where we started here in Singapore. So, we have a team in our company that we are not an American company, we are a global company that happens to be based in the United States. And can we be successful in Asia, my response is we already are. 11 markets in CTV or premium video grew faster than the United States for us. So, when I say 11 markets, I am not – I am not talking about it in general. I am talking about The Trade Desk markets. Our spend grew faster in 11 markets for premium video outside the United States than it did inside the United States, the fastest region for growth around the world, Southeast Asia. It grew faster than Australia grew faster than North Asia, grew faster than Europe. It grew faster or South America. And that’s in large part because we are – just like in every other market, creating alternatives, especially UGC, where YouTube has a very dominant position in many of the markets here. But also you are seeing from the content creators that historically, they have had sort of a regional benefit where there is licensing that has prevented U.S. companies from competing with them in their markets. But one of the reasons why you have seen Australia a close rival to leading in terms of size or percentage of market moving to CTV with the U.S., those two leading the way is because with English language content that no longer having regional barriers, but English content is competing all over the world. And the same thing is happening with Chinese content and all others. So, what you are seeing is that the content owners are no longer viewing their next door neighbor in sort of broadcast as their biggest competitors, but instead looking at companies like Disney and Netflix is their biggest competitors around the world. So, they are all looking at the ad-funded options that those companies are creating around the world and saying that we quickly have to follow in order to compete. And so as a result, we are getting partnerships all over the world. We are setting up partnerships. That is the reason our executive team is here in Asia is because it’s not lost on us, but most of the GDP growth for the next 10 years is going to come out of Asia. And that in order for us to capture our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM, we have to be competitive in Asia as well as in other regions of the world. We are already doing that. And we have been doing that in this market despite things like the strong dollar and economic headwinds and some geopolitical issues, but we continue to do that because of strong partnership and a global mindset. And of course, we represent most of the largest brand in the world. And whether you are talking about Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, these brands advertise all over the world, and it’s not lost on them that GDP growth is going to come out of Asia. It’s not lost on them that the fastest-growing middle class in the world is here in Asia. So, you put all of that together, it’s a market that we are already winning in and we will continue to do so. We have over invested. If you look at our employee count versus our revenue, of course, we are early, not late. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Michael. And Holly, you can close up the call.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.', metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'TTD', 'year': 2022}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth . Please proceed. Chris Toth. Please proceed.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green.: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you’ve seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the second quarter. We reported revenue of $464 million growing 23% compared with last year. This also represents an acceleration in our growth rate compared with the first quarter. And just like the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. What’s particularly notable about our performance is that most advertisers are still dealing with some degree of uncertainty in their business. Even though certain macro indicators are improving, there’s still a sense from many advertisers that we are in an unpredictable environment. For them, it’s hard to dismiss what we’ve been through over the last 2 to 3 years with the global pandemic, rampant inflation, supply chain crises and banking system uncertainty, and of course, global rebalancing. None of these market dynamics have been very predictable the last few years. And this year, like the last few, has similarly had lots of never-before macro events. So while many indicators and advertiser sentiments are improving, there’s also a sense that it’s more difficult than ever to predict what’s coming next. But in this environment, marketers have learned that data-driven precision can bring a sense of certainty and reliability to their advertising efforts. Because of the innovations we brought to market in areas such as retail media, CTV, identity and data, advertisers have a clearer sense than ever of the performance and impact of their ad campaigns. And with Kokai, we are delivering even more innovation, all in service of helping advertisers drive precision, relevance and certainty in everything they do. As a result, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans, or JBPs, with leading agencies and brands representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. Our relative outperformance over the last few quarters means we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company’s history. Advertisers have become more deliberate with their spend and have increasingly gravitated to our platform and as they understand more about the power of programmatic, they are choosing the objectivity and performance of our platform over the murkiness of walled gardens more than ever before. Even as we continue to grow and scale around the world, we see no deviation from our 95%-plus retention rate. Our clients rely on us more and more. I was at the Cannes Advertising Festival a few weeks ago, and I could have filled my calendar several times over with brand CMOs, agency leaders and CEOs of our key partners, all of whom want to understand how we can work more closely together. Every year, demand for the value that we deliver continues to grow. Perhaps what’s most interesting right now is how marketers are seeking a sense of certainty in an uncertain environment. Much of the product rollouts and partnership growth we’ve seen this year is because we’re giving our clients certainty and reliability that they can’t get elsewhere. This shows up all over our client base and all over our platform, but I’d like to talk today about a few places where the certainty and reliability is really driving our relative outperformance particularly in retail media, CTV and identity. By discussing these 3, I believe it will provide some insight as to why we continue to outperform the market, why I believe we’ll continue to outperform the market and why we continue to invest in our platform with all the innovations coming from Kokai. So first, let me talk about retail media, which has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business. Much like CTV, our rapid growth in retail media starts with our focus on objectivity. Retailers know we’re only here to serve advertisers and to drive more precision and efficacy in ad campaigns. We don’t compete with them. And like all of our partners, retailers know, we are careful and objective stewards of their data. As you know, Walmart was one of the first early major retailers to understand the power of their data and to help advertisers understand and measure the connection between campaign spend and actual consumer purchases. For many advertisers, there’s no clear measurement of performance than that. You can look at all kinds of traditional marketing KPIs, but there’s nothing more powerful than knowing that a consumer bought your product because of the ad you serve and then using that data to improve marketing spend in the future. One of the great recent examples of this is Fruit of the Loom, working with our agency, GSD&M, Fruit of the Loom wanted to reach new and existing customers to increase sales with a back-to-school promotion. They were targeting a 200% return on ad spend, or ROAS, working with the Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk, they were able to predict audiences with much more precision and were able to understand in real time, how ads in different channels were performing. They could then shift campaign dollars to those channels that were actually driving consumer purchases. This clear line of sight helps Fruit of the Loom vastly exceed their campaign goals, delivering a 1,200% return on ad spend among existing customers and more than 1,000% ROAS with new customers. Eric Mahoney is Fruit of the Loom’s Digital Marketing Manager. He said, and I quote, historically, we’ve done a really good job of reaching our brand purchasers. But working with the Walmart DSP allowed us to reach that new consumer through predictive audience segments. We could not have achieved these results without Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk.\" He also said that working with The Trade Desk is like putting on a fresh pair of underwear. Of all the accolades we’ve received over the years that is definitely one of my favorites ever. The gravitational pull of retail media is not limited to the U.S., retailers around the world are working with The Trade Desk in different ways to unleash the power of their data to help advertisers bring more value to their campaigns. In Singapore, we partnered with FairPrice, the largest grocery chain there with 570 stores serving 90% of the country’s population. One of the first brands to leverage FairPrice shopper data on our platform was Coca-Cola, who wanted to reach customers during the festive Lunar New Year season. They also wanted to be able to measure the performance of low-funnel marketing outreach across multiple channels, including OTT, audio, digital out-of-home and of course, open Internet display. The campaign tapped into FairPrice’s audience segments via our platform, targeting Fair-Price customers who had purchased Coke or other Coke products over the past 1 to 3 months. They were able to target seasonal shoppers who purchased festive products and optimize in real time to the news and lifestyle channels that delivered the best results. With their agency, EssenceMediacom, Coke was able to drive 189% uplift in sales during the campaign. They were also able to measure consumer reaction in a range of new ways, including the time it takes for a consumer to buy a product following different kinds of ad exposures, audience engagement from different channels and cart values offirst time and repeat buyers. The retail media opportunity is also growing exponentially for us in Europe. In recent quarters, we’ve talked about our partnerships with leading retailers such as Ocado and Tesco. And just a few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Europe’s largest retail group, Schwarz, which includes major brands such as Kaufland and Lidl. From an advertising perspective, retail media is something that’s really taken off over the last 2 years. It’s no coincidence that the growing interest in retail media coincides with growing advertiser focus on authenticated ad environments. With retail media, advertisers can start with precise authenticated data whether that data is based on purchase history or loyalty data. From there, the advertiser can target based on what they know and then do more accurate data-driven modeling to expand targeting segments with greater precision Some of the same dynamics are behind the rapid growth of CTV advertising. As we have all seen in recent weeks, there is a ton of focus right now on the business model of TV. What is the future of the linear TV model? And how does the TV industry create sustainable, profitable business models for streaming TV as viewers shift there in mass. I believe the answer will come in fully exploring the authenticated viewer data that sits at the core of the CTV ecosystem, which is something that today’s leading media companies are exploring. For the past couple of years, CTV has been one of our fastest-growing channels at scale. There are a range of reasons for that. Fundamentally, video remains the most effective way for brands to influence the hearts and minds of consumers. And with CTV, brands can apply data to their TV campaigns and measure with much more precision, the effectiveness of every ad dollar. And much like retail, advertisers value the authenticated audiences that come with CTV, pretty much every streaming TV viewer is logged in with an e-mail address. For advertisers, this means more certainty. It also creates a new starting point centered on data. These dual forces of retail and CTV are truly bringing the power of data-driven decisioning home for advertisers, and it is accelerating their shift to programmatic on our platform. Whereas in the early years of programmatic, we were looking to find ways to affix data to campaigns. Today, we use data as a starting point for campaigns. Instead of hunting for ad opportunities with data, The Trade Desk and marketers are starting with data to know which media opportunities we should hunt for. It’s a different dynamic and it’s one that’s become more prominent as advertisers seek more certainty in an uncertain and unpredictable environment. As I said, media companies generally understand the value of authenticated user data. And this is a major reason why the top streaming companies in the U.S. have pretty much all integrated with UID2 or are planning to. The latest was Warner Bros. Discovery, who announced at Cannes that they will integrate UID2 across all of their streaming properties, including Max and Discovery+. The broad embrace of UID2 across the CTV ecosystem has been driven in part by a key economic factor. Streaming leaders need to unleash the value of their authenticated data for advertisers in order to create as much precision and relevance as possible, thereby maximizing their CPMs. In order for the streaming business model to thrive and for media companies to keep pace in the content arms race, they need to maximize advertising revenue. As we have seen with every streaming platform launching an ad-supported service, a subscription based approach is not enough. And the only way to maximize advertising revenue is to increase precision and relevance. With UID2, the advertiser can start with authenticated data, enrich that with their own and third-party data and then where they can find the right relevant audience, they will pay a meaningfully higher price. As Tim Sims outlined during our Investor Day, where advertisers are able to bid with certainty based on relevance and precision, the value of each impression increases significantly, generally, exponentially. Ultimately, this is how we will answer some of the vexing questions that have been swirling around the TV industry recently. And while we are still in the early days of the CTV advertising revolution, I’m confident that emerging innovations on our platform, such as a forward market for CTV advertising will only accelerate advertisers’ ability and appetite to fund this amazing new golden age of TV. It’s also worth pointing out that this is an increasingly global trend. At Cannes this year, for example, we announced a new partnership with RTL, one of the largest pan-European media companies. Through this partnership, our international advertisers will have exclusive programmatic access to RTL’s addressable linear and connected TV inventory. We are starting with inventory across Germany, Spain, France and Austria with more European markets to follow soon. This represents our most significant step yet into the European CTV market. It’s also indicative of how the major European media companies are keeping pace with changing viewer preferences and advertiser demand to meet viewers where they are and where they are most leaned in. As many of you have seen, we had a lot to say about retail and CTV during our recent Kokai launch. And I’d just like to take a moment to put that in perspective. Because as advertisers increasingly prioritize CTV and retail, it’s critical that we continue to innovate in our platform so that we surface value for our users as intuitively as possible. One way Kokai accomplishes this is with a series of new indexes or benchmarks that help advertisers understand and measure performance. In the retail arena, we launched the Retail Sales Index. The RSI helps advertisers understand the impact of their retail media spend across multiple retailers at once. In this way, we are massively reducing the complexity of measuring ad campaigns that run across multiple retail data sets. Now advertisers can understand which retail environments perform better at different times, in which channels, for which kinds of creatives, all in 1 place. And in doing so, we are providing a level of objectivity and measurement from the bottom of the funnel all the way to the top, that is simply not possible within a walled garden. In addition to that, we also announced a few pioneering retailers who are making retail measurement available for free in our platform if the advertiser has activated their retail data for targeting. These retailers include Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons. This is a major step forward in bringing the full value of retail media to bear in service of greater precision and certainty. In the CTV space, we launched the TV Quality Index, or TVQI. As the CTV advertising market has multiplied in terms of inventory, there are some who would have you believe that a piece of user-generated content has the same quality in the eyes of the viewer as professionally produced content or live sports. Yes, I know there are some UGC influencers who have millions of followers that some brands may target from time to time. But that’s a very small slice of UGC. The vast bulk of it is very unattractive, and sometimes even unsafe for brand advertisers. The TVQI helps advertisers understand the value of the impressions they are buying in the context of the quality of the content those impressions are served against. The index shows that for every 10-point improvement in quality there is a 15-point improvement in conversion rates. Sometimes it’s even higher than that. And for our own campaigns for The Trade Desk, in the second quarter of this year, as we were beta testing TVQI, we found that a 19-point increase in the index score resulted in a 50-point improvement in our conversion rate. If you’re a marketing leader, these are substantial performance improvements. I mentioned those two elements of Kokai because they’re important to understand in the context of CTV and retailer as more advertisers gravitate to CTV and retail because they offer more certainty in starting advertising campaigns based on authenticated audience data, these Kokai innovations provide more certainty through the course of the campaign in terms of measurement and performance optimization. Of course, there are many other aspects of Kokai that we unveiled on 06/06, some of which are live and many of which we will be launching in the next few months. These indexes and other innovations, especially around the application of AI across our platform are helping us surface value more intuitively to advertisers. We are revamping our UX so that the campaign setup and optimization experience is even more intuitive with data next to decisions at every step. And we’re making it easier than ever for thousands of data, inventory, measurement and media partners to integrate with us. In doing so, I believe that The Trade Desk will become an essential innovation hub of the open Internet. I’d like to end on this point because I think it’s important to reiterate that there are many things we do at The Trade Desk that are not in our immediate business interest. UID2, for example, is an innovation we devised about 3 years ago and promptly gave it away to the industry. We’re seeing broad adoption across the data and inventory ecosystems of the open Internet and accelerating use by advertisers. In many ways, the industry is looking at innovations like UID2 as a core element of the flight to certainty that is driving a lot of advertiser action today. If an advertiser has certainty that they are reaching the right person across all channels, they will prioritize that ad buy. CTV and retail are major advancements in this regard, but UID2 is a major building block of this new cross-channel identity fabric too. This is particularly important as there has recently been a lot of speculation regarding the potential demise of third-party cookies in Chrome in early 2024. A lot of this speculation reminds me of the frenzy in 2017 when Safari deprecated cookies or more recently in 2021 when Apple made its IDFA changes. Each time I have stated that none of this will have a significant material effect on our business, and that was true. I’ve said many times that I’m not sure that it’s in Google’s best interest to get rid of third party cookies because of the harmful impact it will likely have on publishers that have not implemented a strong identity strategy. But while it matters a lot to many browser-based publishers, in the long run, it really doesn’t matter that much to us. Advertisers will increasingly select ad opportunities where they can act with certainty and leverage their own data. That’s why I’ve spent so much time today talking about CTV, retail and UID2 as they have become essential building blocks of the open Internet. On the supply side, we developed OpenPath, to provide our clients with a direct transparent path to inventory. This is just the latest effort by the Trade Desk to improve supply-side transparency and objectivity and we now have thousands of destinations across the open Internet, integrating with OpenPath. And when advertisers see an OpenPath channel to inventory, they are more likely to select it versus the 8 to 10 alternative paths to that same impression because there’s more certainty. And now integrating with UID2, OpenPath or any number of other innovations or offerings on our platform is easier than ever with Kokai. We believe that to truly optimize the value of the open Internet, there are many ways in which the industry needs to innovate together. So we can provide advertisers as an ecosystem with more certainty, transparency and objectivity. In recent weeks, we’ve heard even more about the alleged dubious behavior of walled gardens, whether it’s from the European Commission or independent research reports. Advertisers and media companies are increasingly aware that they need to work with technology partners who represent their interest, not conflicts of interest. As a result, advertising dollars are shifting to our platform. And we will continue to invest in our platform and push the industry to create even more value for advertisers on the open Internet. Our recent outperformance is not a temporary blip, I believe it is the start of a reassessment of the value of the Internet, particularly from an advertiser’s perspective, and I could not be more excited about the growth opportunity that is in front of us in the years ahead as a result. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. For nearly the past 10 years, I’ve experienced firsthand all of the incredible work from The Trade Desk teams around the world that produce our outstanding performance that have enabled us to manage the right balance between strong growth and significant profitability. I’m proud to present our results today and going forward. With that, on to the numbers. As you’ve seen in our results, Q2 was a strong quarter. Revenue was $464 million, representing growth of 23% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year was about 24.5% on a year-over-year basis. Visibility and advertiser sentiment continued to improve throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain share as marketers increasingly focus their investments on areas where data is deployed effectively, where AI and decisioning produce high ROI and where results are measurable and transparent. Our growth continued to be driven by the shift of budgets to connected TV and increasing use of retail data. Because of our objectivity and our connectivity to nearly every major CTV content provider, our platform is the most eligible for the tidal wave of demand as it shifts away from linear and walled gardens. In retail media, many of the largest retailers around the world are now our partners and more and more brands and agencies are taking advantage of this powerful data in their campaigns. We also continue to benefit from the trust we’ve built with our clients, launching innovative products in the interest of the demand side, paving cleaner path to supply and cultivating industry-wide support for improved identity solutions like UID2 and EUID. During the second quarter, growth was broad-based across channels, verticals and regions. CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum again in retail media as we launched integrations with more retailers and won incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q1 with notably strong performance in CTV. And with the launch of Kokai in early June, we are well positioned for the second half of the year and 2024 as visibility and advertiser sentiment improve. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $180 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout all our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. This outperformance led to free cash flow of $119 million in Q2. Our unique ability to generate meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow continues to put us in a strong position as we look ahead and invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our growth in the years to come. This is an area I’m intently focused on, making certain that our productivity and efficiency remains best-in-class as we scale as we manage both industry-leading growth and significant profitability. I believe this is a critical factor to our success in the next phase of growth. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that international Growth slightly outpaced North America for the second quarter in a row. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover. Automotive was strong once again with growth accelerating each month during the quarter due to share gains and recovery. We also saw strong performance in home and garden and food and beverage, while shopping and business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still opportunity for us to gain share in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $305 million, up 22% year-over-year. There are ample opportunities to achieve significantly more leverage within our operating expenses. However, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and grabbing land. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, included realized costs from our 2022 hiring ramp, infrastructure investments and return to office expenses. Because we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the last few years, we’re in a strong position to continue innovating for clients, growing our teams and widening the distance between us and our competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $139 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $119 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 76 days, up about 3 days from a year ago. In Q2 via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 595,000 shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $44 million. We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $485 million, which would represent growth of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $185 million in Q3. In closing, we’re extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. I’ve always seen the immense opportunity this company has. And frankly, that opportunity has never been clearer than it is today. We have a large and growing addressable market in front of us. We have a business model that’s proven to generate strong top line growth in addition to significant profitability and cash flow. With growth drivers including CTV, retail media or international business, a strong identity strategy, a 2024 U.S. election year cycle, and a significant product upgrade with Kokai, among others, we remain highly optimistic about our future as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil from SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on another strong performance. I had a 2-part question. First for Jeff, could you provide your thoughts on the macro and the current conditions and also your initial thoughts on next year, on 2024? And then Laura, can you talk about how you’re thinking about investments and expenses in the back half of this year, but also next year as well.\\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question, Shyam. I’ll go first, and then I’ll just hand it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses. So it’s not news to anybody here that the last 2 or 3 years have been a few years of uncertainty and unpredictability for most advertisers and most of the Fortune 500. As a result, I’m extremely excited by the change in sentiment that we’ve seen in Q2 and see already in Q3, where CMOs are doubling down on what’s driving growth there’s an understanding, of course, that the markets have begun to recover, and there’s more certainty than they’ve had in the past. But they’ve also come to rely on data-driven advertising during that time of uncertainty as a place for certainty and for results. So we’re seeing lots of shifts due to what they’ve experienced in the last few years in CTV. And then, of course, this massive secular tailwind that comes from retail data as well. As I’ve said before, I believe ultimately, the shape of the Internet changes dramatically as a result of CTV and retail media. And then, of course, we’ve also seen some amazing results as a result of UID2 adoption. You might have caught during the prepared remarks that Warner Bros. was kind of the last of the U.S. independent CTV players to adopt UID2. So now, in a way, UID2 has the full collection here in the United States, and that has become the common currency to monetize CTV in the ad environment. We expect that trend to continue, and we’re seeing more and more of that. For the second part of your question for me, 2024 is looking like the tidal wave of opportunity that is both daunting as well as just massive in terms of what an incredible chance this is for us to once again grab land. So let me first just talk about some of the backdrop for 2024. So there’s been a lot of pressure on Google over the last few years as it relates to antitrust as well as privacy. Of course, there’s a balance between those 2 that a few years ago, there was a lot more pressure on the privacy side of that. Today, there’s a lot more pressure on the antitrust side of that, which we think overall makes the market a bit more fair and makes it easier to predict Google’s decisions. It also makes it so that they are undoubtedly going slower and that creates opportunity for us to once again grab land. I have said over and over again that linear television is not going to be a steady decline. It ends with an explosion. It’s going to have a pretty steady, then accelerating decay. And then there’s a point where it stops being worth it for anybody to operate in the space. You’ve kind of got a glimpse of this when Bob Iger was saying 3 weeks ago on CNBC, that he’s unsure about ABC’s future and their linear business model being broken, but of course, that streaming and the studios are very important to the future of the business. That business model is really talking about legacy linear and broadcast television and that, of course, the future is streaming. That represents one of the many opportunities for us in 2024. Now as our opportunity to demonstrate the power of decisioning, which is really what our brand new product release Kokai is all about. We also have some major advances going into next year as it relates to the forward market. But when you add CTV retail media, Kokai, UID2, OpenPath, international opportunities, political, the list goes on and on. Of course, Disney announced today that they’ll roll out ad-supported models internationally for Disney+. We think that’s one of many opportunities around the world for us as it relates to CTV. So the secular tailwinds just keep piling up, but very excited about all that. I’ll turn it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thanks, Jeff, and Shyam, thanks for the question. In terms of our investments for the second half of 2023 and going into 2024, I’ll start off just the big picture and then get into the specifics of what we’re seeing. So just always remind myself that we’ve got the great luxury of high growth, profitability and cash flow. And we’ve been responsibly managing our headcount, OpEx growth and investments for many years now. So in the first half of 2023, we grew revenue in the 20% range. And we just guided to continued growth acceleration in revenue when you exclude U.S. election spend that we saw in the same period in 2022. So from my perspective, we’re in an enviable position, while many of our other peers have struggled. So when I look out at the rest of 2023, I just look at how we’re being very deliberate in our investments and in our hiring, and we still expect headcount to grow this year, but roughly at half the rate of last year, which implies around 20%. And that sets us up very nicely for 2024, just as I remind everyone that our people are our largest area of investment. We’re also investing heavily into our platform and our products, specifically in areas like CTV and our forward market product and in retail media. And as we’re doing this, we’re focusing heavily on productivity and efficiency with all of our teams from our engineering teams to our go-to-market, business, sales AM and trading teams to make sure that we believe that all of our teams are firing on all cylinders. For this year, we also expect CapEx to be lower than last year. So last year, we came in with around $80 million of investments. And I’d expect that to be around $60 million in 2023. And just a reminder, our CapEx levels include all of our AI investments, and we don’t expect any significant step-up in investments that you may have seen in some other firms. So just to sum up and as it relates to our modeling, as we’ve seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops down to the bottom line as happened in Q1 and Q2 of this year. And we’re very comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about our business for the rest of the year.\\nOperator: The next question is from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.\\nShweta Khajuria: Jeff, I have a question on cookie deprecation. So you touched on this in your prepared remarks, and there’s quite a bit of focus on it given that we are coming close to 2024 here and Google’s plan to deprecate cookies. Would love to hear your thoughts on you think the magnitude of impact on Trade Desk, in particular, why you think it’s not going to be meaningful and the overall industry, how you think about the impact? A - Jeff Green You bet. Thanks Shweta, I appreciate the question. So first, let me just say, we’ve been down this path before. So when Safari made cookies go away, there was anxiety, when GDPR first came out, there was anxiety and IDFA removal happened, there was anxiety. And in every one of those cases, our business continued to grow, and we saw very little impact, a speed bump at best. So I see this as slightly – or not slightly, exactly the same as all of those other things. But the reason for that is because a phenomenon that is just different about our business than most other businesses that are in the space. And so we look at 12 million ad opportunities every second and we choose from those 1 million or 2 million that we want to buy. If identity is removed from – instead of it being on 6 million, it’s now a 3 million, it just informs which ones we buy differently. We’re still going to buy the same amount, and we’re still going to be informed on the vast majority of those and in part because we’ve been so strong in growing CTV as well as leveraging UID2, we have an alternative in the biggest driver of our business in CTV that is present on nearly 100% of impressions, which is way better than anything in the browsing Internet world. So just to be clear, but this directly impacts is the browsing Internet world of everything that runs on top of Chrome. So now let me talk for a second about the industry and be a bit more holistic because hopefully, I’ve made my point that I don’t believe this impacts us in any meaningful way. And in fact, I think you can make the argument that it affects us in a positive way just as much as it does in a negative way just because it would be negative to all the players that are dependent on cookies and because so much of our business now is driven off of UID2 and CTV, I think you can make the argument that we would benefit from sort of hurting lots of the independent competition. It is actually for that reason that I believe it is a strategic mistake for Google to get rid of cookies. And as they’re facing more antitrust scrutiny rather than any other regulatory scrutiny, I don’t think it’s in their best interest to do, I think, because of the way that the case dates are stacking up that they won’t likely make any decisions until the end of Q1 next year. If they do make cookies go away then, I do think it will be very bad for some publishers, especially those touching journalism, that were historically print journalists, I do believe that will really have a bad effect upon them. And it won’t have a great effect on the open Internet. But I do think it will be good for us. I do think that many of the consumer data companies will actually be better off because nearly all of their data is anchored off of an e-mail address. And the way that we leverage data is just much, much better in a world built around UID2. So I do think that it would accelerate the adoption of UID2 into the browsing Internet world, not just among CTV and audio and that would ultimately be good for us, but I don’t think there would be a quick recovery for many of the web-based publishers, especially those affecting journalism. And so it will be a net negative for the open Internet, but probably a slight positive for us.\\nOperator: The next question is from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, I wanted to talk about retail media. You spoke about the success you’re having with Walmart. We know that last year, there was a group of retailers that also came online. And so question number one, how is that coming along? Should we see contribution to revenue next year from those retailers? And then given that, would you be willing to update your thoughts on your plan in retail media that you gave us at your Investor Day, last October.\\nJeff Green: You bet, thank you. So let me first explain one of the reasons why I think it’s so exciting what’s happening in shopper marketing. So of course, many retailers have been sitting on amazing data where they know what’s actually being purchased, especially for those products that you tend to buy at the store and not online so many of the products in grocery stores and pharmacies are still primarily purchased in a store rather than online. And then, of course, many of them have amazing online presences as well as, of course, brick-and-mortar off-line. So many of them are bringing their data into the ecosystem, and they’ve recognized that the way that they’ve operated in the past creates a bit of a needle in a haystack problem where you take a small amount of data and you go look in that massive ocean of 12 million ads available every single second, and you go look for the usually thousands or tens of thousands that have your data on it. And so you start with the data and you go hunting for it. Well, in this new world where things are leveraging UID from the very beginning, you get rid of the sort of 9 dominos that need to fall in the supply chain so that you can then leverage the data, but instead, you start with the data and you’re actually just looking at the opportunities that match that instead of going out and looking for opportunities in that way. So by starting with the data, you make it so that you get rid of the matching problems of cookies, and you make it so that the flywheel spin faster for all of these businesses. So they’re not just making additional money on a small amount of data, but they’re actually selling more products across their entire company. It’s actually part of the reason why I believe that the moves that were made by 3 of the most the forward-looking pioneers in the retail data space, which includes Dollar General, Albertsons and Walgreens that we’re all looking for an opportunity to do something new in data. They made their data available for free so long as people will pay to use it for targeting. So their data is available for measurement so that advertisers can, without any significant opt-in or any friction, find out where they’re selling products, and it’s their belief as well as ours that, that will make it so that people are automatically optimizing their advertising purchases to sell products in those 3 stores. If we are all proven right, we think this represents a massive change to the way people leverage data in brick-and-mortar stores and in retail. And that just will continue to accelerate this flywheel that is spinning in shopper marketing. I just want to remind everybody that shopper marketing is not just about shopper marketing itself, it is about improving the entire funnel. So every CPG has massive amount of incremental data and insight to know where to spend their money in advertising so that they are being more effective. So all of this has the sort of a flywheel effect of improving decisioning, moving more dollars to our platform, making efficacy go up across everything on our platform. And then, of course, there is an overlap between shopper marketing and CTV where they both benefit from each other, especially because in most cases, their data is anchored off of UID2, which of course, is e-mail based in both the shopper marketing world and in the CTV world. So all of that together creates just yet another amazing secular tailwind for us in shopper marketing or retail.\\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\\nMatthew Cost: Maybe just on the CTV market. When we think about what you’ve learned through the upfront, this year. How are you feeling about growth and trends in the market through the back half and into ’24? And then on a related note, if you could just give an update on the new forward market. What is the level of interest in it? And how are those conversations trending to that new product? A - Jeff Green You bet, thank you. So let me just say that I have never been more bullish on CTV than we are right now and that includes all of the major news and headlines that are contributing to the current environment. You’re seeing everyone in CTV look to add and/or enhance their ad-funded options. Nearly all of them are doubling down on the ad-funded options. So where there’s just a few years ago, there was a religion around only having subscriptions and not having ads. That’s gone, across the board. Everybody is looking to add ads and make them more effective. So the secular tailwind on our business is as great as it’s ever been because of those things. Also because there, of course, is a writers and actors strike, that makes it – so it’s much harder to sell at the upfront for all the content owners, which of course, the upfront is predominantly built for broadcast and legacy television. In order to take advantage of the very best of digital, we need a more sophisticated forward market than just the upfront, which is effectively a party where transactions are done with handshakes and very high-level data instead of the sort of precision that data-driven advertising can bring in an impression by impression and customized user by user, that environment can bring. And so our product that we have been working on literally for years on the forward market, makes it possible for people to have a much more sophisticated upfront buy. So the early phases have gone well. It is still very early phase. So I don’t expect it to see all of the fruit harvested and even in 2024, this is going to be something that we build up over the years. But I see it in the long term being a very significant portion of our business.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Jeff, I was hoping you could talk about the Kokai launch. I know it’s really early, but would love to hear feedback on just initial reaction, how it’s compared to your expectations? And just perhaps even stepping back, some of the behaviors you’re observing from this versus what you’ve seen in prior launches like Solimar and Next Wave. And as a quick follow-up for Laura. Could you talk a little bit about just linearity in June and July. There’s been a couple of prints so far this earnings season talking about a little bit more macro softness in there. So curious about any trends you’re seeing there.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks Justin for the question. I’ll take the first part and then have Laura, you take the second. So first, let me explain what Kokai is. So Kokai is a Japanese word that means open for business or open waters. And the reason why we chose that is because we believe this is a very important moment in the open Internet to make it possible for more and more companies to build to us in a variety of ways. One of them being to sell their products. So we have value-added resellers that are selling on our product all the time, whether that’s in data, whether that’s in algos, there’s a whole bunch of ways with – contextual data, so many ways. And then the other is then is advertisers, in particular, bringing their first-party data to the table. And so with those as the overarching mission, Kokai has really built in 5 major sort of categories or pieces. The first is massive improvement to the use of data so you’ll recall, we launched Galileo earlier this year, and we also announced that Kokai, the creation of a partner portal where people can integrate to onboard their first-party data. The second is the use of AI across our platform. You’ll recall that we launched AI in our platform in 2018 before it was trendy. And we called it then Koa and distributing that AI across the platform in a variety of different ways and different deep learning models so that we’re using that for very specific applications rather than trying to create one algo to rule them all, if you will, which is something we actually very – in a very disciplined way, try to avoid. So that we can create checks and balances in the way that the tech works, and we can make certain that AI is always providing improvements by essentially having A/B testing and better auditability. The third thing is measurement. So first, we improved data onboarding. Second, we improved AI distributed throughout the system. Third, we improved measurement so that we can to measure the efficacy of ads, especially using retail data. We came up with a couple of new ways of measuring, which is the Retail Sales Index, where we take a variety of different retailers and put all of their data together so that they’re way better than the sum of the parts. And then TVQI, the TV Quality Index, we’re helping advertisers see the benefit of being on premium content versus cat videos or worse that often comes from user-generated content. Then fourth, in the second half of the year, there will be a new user experience. So that’s right around the corner, of course, because we’re in the second half of the year. So very excited about what that means. I believe this is our biggest and most impressive U.S. upgrade ever, and it’s going to create better behaviors among buyers and because it comes with much better forecasting, they’ll get to see the decisions they’re making and the impact before they even run, which is new. That is something much better than what we’ve had over the last 14 years. I’m very excited about what that means. And then last but not least is integrations for better CTV measurements and performance across the board as well. So lots to be excited about, but Kokai is our biggest relief. I expect it to be our most successful, but I will say that because this requires adoption during the busiest time of the year – because this requires a change in behavior, I don’t expect there to be lots of adoption during the busiest time of the year. And so most of the benefits will be reaped in 2024 and 2025. But we’re seeing a lot of the rollout of especially the first couple that I mentioned already seeing some impact already, seeing some performance enhancements. But as we go into 2024, we expect this to once again change the way that media buying is performed. Laura, do you mind taking the second half of the question?\\nLaura Schenkein: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Justin. On linearity in June and July, we’ve seen visibility improve as the year progressed. And we continue to see improving trends throughout Q2, where we saw our revenue growth accelerate to north of 23% year-over-year from around 21% in Q1. We exited June on a great trajectory, and that’s continued so far in Q3. So we expect a strong Q3 for the same reasons that we outperformed the rest of digital advertising over the last few quarters, which is that we’re continuing to see strong growth in CTV, in retail media and in international spend, all of which have been accretive to us this year. So I believe we remain – are well positioned for the second half of 2023 and even further out as we move into 2024.\\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, we’ve seen some developments around \"premium\" marketplaces in CTV built around SSPs. As you talk with marketers, do you get a sense that some may be willing to give up some of the precision or expressiveness with which they manage their programmatic CTV budgets in exchange for a lower tax or are they really more focused on getting as precise as possible to maximize ROI?\\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me first just describe a conversation that I had with the CEO of one of the publicly traded SSPs, where we were just talking about PG, or programmatic guarantees. And just talking about how he saw things. And he and I agreed that as people are moving budgets over from traditional television or linear – they are – sorry. As they’re moving over budgets, from traditional TV or linear. They’re often looking for programmatic guarantees as a place where they’ll spend first. But as he and I both agreed, they always end with spending in decisions because decisioning is much, much better. So we’ve recently done some studies on decisioning across the platform and compared it to PG. And we found that the value of decisioning or the performance of the decisioning on a CPA basis is 5x better in general, or if you were to say it in terms of savings, it’s an 83% save in order to – in CPA costs in order to decision. So whatever incremental tax, as you put it comes, which is usually, in our case, the 20%-ish take rate, that take rate is more than justified by the power of decisioning that comes to the table. And that’s exactly why even the SSPs and their leadership are predicting that long-term things move towards decisioning, but the PG is an on-ramp. We sometimes compare it to a freeway, where it’s an on-ramp and you get on the freeway. But if you stay on the on-ramp, you’re doing it wrong. And so that’s what we see happening. That’s what we think the SSPs see happening, but there will be some moves in the very short term towards these premium PMPs that are centered around especially programmatic guarantees that long term, we think, move towards decisioning and broader data usage.\\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Salmon with New Street Research.\\nDan Salmon: I got a 2-parter here. Jeff, maybe could you give us an update on any discussions you’re having with industry bodies to act as a public administrator for UID2 in various markets? Is that still an important goal? Are you happy with existing relationships? And obviously, you’ve got a lot of private integrations you’ve done as well. And then second, you mentioned how identity is increasingly anchored by an e-mail address, yet it’s pretty clear that Apple doesn’t exactly love the use of e-mails for marketing purposes. Is that something that matters to you? Or do you feel comfortable with the level of consent that UID2 collects because Apple also seems fine when digital advertising uses consent in first-party data. Any views on that would be great.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So let me go in reverse order just because I think the significance of your comments around Apple is important. So any of us that operate in the Apple ecosystem are putting in our Apple ID, which incidentally is an e-mail address over and over and over again. In fact, we’re not even – we don’t even know why we’re putting it in most of the time. You’re asked to put it in. You say, why? And then you put it in. And then you’re asked again and then you put it in and you are asked again. Apple has used their e-mail-based identifier to provide personalization, they have updated many of the things that they said they wouldn’t do before so that they can leverage that Apple ID to provide personalization. It is exactly that, that I think provides a validation that UID2 is one of the most privacy- centric ways to provide personalization across the Internet. It’s used across many of the biggest platforms and with some of the biggest companies in the world, whether that’s at Amazon, whether that’s at Snowflake, whether that’s at Disney, there’s just hundreds of companies that are leveraging that, which of course, is based on an e-mail address not dissimilar from the massive empires at Google and Apple, which are also built around e-mail-based identifiers. So I don’t think the comparison that Apple is allergic to them is fair because their entire ecosystem is built on an e-mail-based identifier. As it relates to the public administrator of UID2. Honestly, it’s not that important. Most of our integrations are done privately. Of course, we were happy to hand it off and look for the right public administrator, as it continues to scale and as if it comes to a more pressing issue, but it hasn’t been yet. We want to make certain that somebody that is that public administrator, of course, shares the vision of protecting the open Internet. And at times is willing to stand up and do the right thing even if it’s not popular. That can be very difficult to find. And so that’s something that we’ll be very deliberate about, but it has not slowed down anything in not having that. So we’re not in any rush to change the status quo.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Zgutowicz with Benchmark.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, just regarding earlier comment you made, I was hoping to get clarification how – I think you had said UID2 benefits you more in a cookie-less world. And I’m just curious how that is because it’s predominantly used as a matching mechanism between large pubs and advertisers and that data signal isn’t sort of privy to you. So I’m trying to just understand that a bit more. And then secondly, regarding OpenPath, appears that there’s a natural hesitancy that we’re hearing among publishers, large pubs to giving you more view into their CTV inventory or autonomy per se. I’m just curious if you agree with that and how you overcome it.\\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So the reason why we benefit from cookies potentially going away in the form of UID2 is that we have been saying to advertisers, every advertiser needs to have an identity strategy. We’ve been saying to publishers, every publisher needs to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And by authentication, we mean there needs to be some way that you’re encouraging people to log in. And in the case that you have log-ins, finding some way to leverage them. Very few companies on the Internet are leveraging their log-ins to provide personalization to the level that they could be. And there certainly hasn’t been much effort to leverage those outside of their own ecosystems or to make it possible for those that are bringing advertising demand to leverage the authentication on those particular publishers. If cookies were to go away, the need for that goes up dramatically and so for many of the publishers – and we saw this with GDPR, we saw this with the IDFA movement. There are many publishers that are saying, \"oh, well, wait until I have to. I’ll wait to make changes until I have to.\" When they have to, they will make changes quickly. We saw a fire drill around GDPR among publishers, where they were very quickly working to create the right personalization again. And again, I just want to remind everybody what’s at stake here. Think of how many print journalism companies have struggled to stay in business due to the Internet. And if you take their CPMs where they get a significant amount of revenue from $5 per ad to $2 per because relevance goes down, then they no longer can stay around. And that’s why I say that cookies going away poses a threat to journalism. But that would make it so that they’re very quickly leveraging those log-ins. And when you’re saying, \"Oh, I get to see 1 out of 3 articles before I have to pay.\" I think you’ll see a lot more of authentication at the beginning of almost every website, not dissimilar from if you go to a furniture or clothing website today. The very first thing you see is type in your e-mail address, you’ll get 10% off. If you type in your e-mail address, only then will you get access to content, that will create much more authentication across the browsing web and that will make it so that UID can be end-to-end without the thinking problems that cookie has and those thinking problems going away would create a much more personalized Internet. And again, because we go from the 12 million ads available every second, down to the 1 million that we buy, if there’s identity on slightly fewer of those, or in some cases, slightly fewer, but the signal is much, much stronger and reliable, that can be an upgrade. So there’s a whole bunch of room for upgrades. As it relates to your OpenPath question, I would say I’m not really seeing the same thing that you’re describing in terms of the obstacles. There’s lots of discussion around the way that we integrate. There’s lots of discussion around priority because many of the companies that are in the ad-funded CTV space are trying to enhance their ad-funded options, and they’re working very quickly to try to enhance those. The amount of pressure on streaming companies, I would say is at an all-time high right now, to grow and to grow profitably and to fund the content. And so often, they’re looking at ways to create more efficiency and OpenPath creates a more efficient supply chain. So something where there’s a more efficient supply chain so that they take home a greater percentage of an ad dollar is a very important next step in the evolution of CTV and streaming.\\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Kelley with Stifel.\\nMark Kelley: Great. And I will stick to one since we’re over time here. But Jeff, I wanted to ask you about if you’re seeing any impact from the MediaMath bankruptcy? And any other thoughts on share gains, whether it’s from competing DSPs or Laura mentioned verticals that you think maybe you under index? Any color there would be great.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So we definitely see some impacts to our business. So let me first just say, MediaMath is essentially exponentially smaller than we are. So it’s not a huge lift, but there are definitely some benefits. One of the first places was with employees. We have a lot of respect for what they had built and they did a lot of things right. And they also had some different perspectives on some things that we did. So we’re excited to have added a few people from the MediaMath team to our company. There’s also been some cases where there’s business upper grabs. In some cases, we won that business outright. But what most advertisers do, especially those that were running anything sizable on MediaMath is they run a process. They test a variety of platforms. They put together a crawl, walk, run plans with each of them. And I think we’re benefiting from that as much as anybody in the space or in the world. But as a result of those sort of deliberate crawl, walk, run efforts, I anticipate that it will be a sort of slow increase where we’ll once again see benefits come at all different paces, but we expect to win more business as a result, especially in next year.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Mark. And John, can you please close the call out?\\nOperator: Absolutely. This concludes today’s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you, that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around any macroeconomic deceleration, potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in various regions where we operate, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend in our platform, are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the Risk Factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. Lastly, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Analyst Day on Tuesday, October 4, 2022 in New York City. This event will be webcast and available on our Investor Relations website. I’ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you’ve seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share, despite some macroeconomic uncertainty. In the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, the Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and Connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we sign new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven’t spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I’d like to today, because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment. Joint business plans, or JBPs, our long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multi-year period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnerships and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world’s largest automakers and technology companies along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs. Many people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and wind share regardless of the economic environment. I’d like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back. First, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that’s the worldwide shift to advertising fueled connected television. I don’t know that we’ve ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic. The second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google’s ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last two decades, when dollars move over from offline spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment, that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google’s advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world. CTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though, because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or double click, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive, because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound coupled with these competitive market dynamics for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV. CTV is fast becoming a must buy. And in some cases, the highest stack rank part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content. And lastly, I’d like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we’re doing and how we’re taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple years. We’ve seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the states attorneys general concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google’s ads business, but it’s not just here in the United States, it’s also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the UK’s competitive market authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the UK. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, we’re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising costs for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google’s biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity. By contrast, we don’t own any inventory and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can’t overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising. Especially, the large brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I’m confident we will do well, regardless of Google’s moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand side platform or DSP. In addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I am often asked to speak about the open internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet. I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I’m concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google’s behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that’s for another day, I believe so long as we execute The Trade Desk is going to do well, regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly, as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we’re so optimistic about our future. So with that, let’s shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics, and how we’re executing. So let’s discuss what’s happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we’re very clear on our mission and we’re extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side and our goals are clear to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain. It’s because of these factors that more and more of the world’s leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It’s also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it’s Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated or Amazon’s AWS ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2. The same with Experian who’s using UID2 as a common currency, where Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brands, selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this. I also want to talk about Netflix recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models, similar to how they led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We’ve had many constructive conversation with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising. The Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet, the fact that Netflix didn’t choose Google is very telling. We believe it’s another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest. Xandr is a strong sell side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they’ve done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable demand side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher in this case Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy. Disney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad supported option. The economics of the market demanded. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them. For example, one of our early CTV partners NBC continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery+ and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world’s leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising. And CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It’s where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It’s where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged in user base is where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. There is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They’ve spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized, experience across all of their channels, but as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumer’s privacy is highly protected. As you’ve seen Disney recently announced and expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their audience graph, which is now interoperable with UID2. Aaron LaBerge the President and CTO of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, perhaps set at best and I quote. The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buy net scale, and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney. I want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you’ve been paying attention to anything we’ve said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you’ll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I’ve said, I’m not sure it is ever in Google’s best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn’t really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google’s decision making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies that doesn’t really capture the scope of what’s going on. And Disney is a great example of this. Disney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It’s much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner. Part of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here, is because we’ve already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that’s something of this central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform. And AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian marketing services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets. As we’ve said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bills. First and foremost, it’s about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry. And with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need pure more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that’s why I’m confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said, at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Of course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty, but even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009, while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gain share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it’s because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar, that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decision advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there’s no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk. Throughout the first half of 2022, and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part that’s because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing, advertising that delivers the highest return and CTV has moved up the priority list. So, while we can’t control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We will never rest on our laurels, as one of the few high growth tech companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company’s history. A year later, a 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform. With all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet. Within Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and Target and we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it’s the data infrastructure work that’s already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EUID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction. We continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We’re working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year’s upfront and early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory. As I said, at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead. And with that, I’ll pass the baton to Blake, who’ll give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top-line growth of 35% is especially impressive, given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spent, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of. During the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We’ve successfully completed a full transition to Solimar and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression. We are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although, it is still very early days for us spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well. With the continued strong top-line performance in Q2, we generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again, in Q2. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live companywide event and over three years, resumed and travel also continued to ramp up. From a channel perspective, CTV via a wide margin, let our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV represented a low-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, and display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency, as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represents at least 1% of our spend, fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year, but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, CTV spend in Europe, again more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investment so will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data driven with their ad spend much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend nearly all of them groom the double digits during the quarter, both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average however, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally automotive still grew the double-digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses, Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $250 million up 45% year-over-year. Growth and operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development. As we continue to build the platform for long-term growth, as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock based awards, the timing of which are variable. Adjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days up nine days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days up six days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3. While there’s continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question is coming from Shyam Patil from Susque. Your line is live.\\nShyam Patil: Hey guys, congrats on the results and the outlook. Jeff, I wanted to ask, this is now the second quarter in a row where your results and outlook are significantly better than, what we’re seeing from other app supported companies, especially in the face of a slowing macro. And I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, what you think is driving that outperformance? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Well, so first let me just say, I’m incredibly proud of our Q3, r the start to our Q3 and especially our performance in Q2. But let me just highlight just a couple of the things that have really gone our way in Q2 and given us so much momentum going into Q4 or going into Q3 and Q4. First, we have an amazing secular tailwind of CTV, arguably the best secular tailwind we’ve ever had. Second, we are of course, seeing the benefits of Solimar, which we’ve gone to a 100% and it just has all these benefits to our clients. Third, we’ve got this, this momentum around the joint business plans where we’re just getting closer to brands and we’re creating better partnerships with each of them. And one of the things that they’re excited about is just our relationships in shopper marketing, the overall call, we started with the very biggest retailer in the world in Walmart and we just continued to expand on that. We highlighted some of those included Albertsons during the prepared remarks. But I do want to emphasize that we have never claimed to be a bellwether of the economy or of advertising yet. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of times people look at our performance and say, how is this so different than everybody else’s? And what is often happening is, we are winning because of those secular tailwinds and because programmatic is growing share and because digital is growing share and meanwhile it is possible to have some macroeconomic headwinds in our face and have a secular tailwind of CTV and all the things I just talked about that, that overshadow that. And I think what we are seeing right now is just an amazing trend, which is that, that CTV in particular is extremely competitive. It’s also extremely effective. And so, as people are looking for alternatives to walled gardens they are looking to companies like us, who can give them objectivity to buy across all these fragmented places. Many of the smaller walled gardens, I think are especially under pressure. And as I’ve said, I think CTV can be the thing that brings down the walled gardens. But that’ll start with those that are smallest. So, I think often, we’re being compared to walled gardens of various sizes, and I don’t necessarily think that the fair comparison, and of course, I think we’re also in anomaly from the macro. So, hopefully that par is out all those things, but I’m really proud of what we did in Q2 and really optimistic about our Q3.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Shyam.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov [Cannonball]. Your line is live.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Just to follow up maybe on this, on the first question, can you, Jeff, please talk about what’s going on in Connected TV. I’m sure, that some Connected TV players reported fairly slow growth in Q2 and guided to continued slow growth in the remainder of the year. So and if I listen to your remarks and assuming that your Connected TV spend is growing at least double your overall spend, that would imply at least 50% growth. So can you explain to us, how to understand that what the diversification is about and does the quick follow up there, maybe you can tell us about how you use the terms scatter market and spot market in Connected TV that sort of became a thing this earning season?\\nJeff Green: Yes, no problem first. And thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, CTV is a secular tailwind that it continues to help drive our business. I would even say it continues to lead our business, including our growth. The scale that we’re seeing is amazing. And the changes in the world, including the pandemic, which made everybody stay home and stream a lot more, have created changes to the ecosystem that I don’t think anybody predicted. And, if you just take a step back and you think about if five years ago, you would’ve thought that HBO and Netflix would be showing ads I think a lot of people were public about saying that isn’t going to happen and it’s happening now, so there are these tailwinds that I just can’t overstate. And that as a result, CTV is often becoming the place where the very first dollar it is spent. But one of the things, I really like about your question and it gives me a platform to talk about is, okay, well then why isn’t everyone in CTV seeing the same sort of growth that you are seeing? And there are a couple reasons for that one. There are some companies that are deployed the walled garden strategy, which is that I have something special either on my operating system or on my channel, and you should buy that exclusively through me. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no one in CTV has a position that is strong enough to be draconian the same way that you can in other parts of digital like search or social or some of those others. So as a result those tactics, I think are proving more difficult as more and more choices are coming online. So a platform that sits objectively and helps people choose across the 20, 30, 40 places where you can buy, I mean, think of your own habits as a consumer, you were probably watching CTV on two or three apps five years ago. Now you’re probably watching them on seven, eight, nine, 10 plus that fragmentation creates a greater need for somebody to centrally partner with all of them measure, reach, and frequency and performance across all of them, and has to have a business model that is eligible to partner with everybody. So that’s why I would argue that we have outperformed everybody else is that unique position and that unique strategy that we’ve deployed as it relates to scatter versus spot and there, I know in this earning season, there has been some discussion about scatter, let me just break it down really simply, scatter is a reference to linear or traditional television where you buy things in upfront, those things that either don’t work out as planned or need to be adjusted to you create this middle market, where you’re buying traditional television with traditional budgets in not very sophisticated, quickly adapt market. Separately from that is a spot market. And what I would call the spot market is the programmatic market that we operate in. And so when people talk about scatter and spot, especially because when they’re talking to people in the financial industry, they can draw analogies to equities. That don’t seem that different, but really what we’re talking about in television one is very closely associated with the upfront market, which was invented in the 60s. The other one we’re talking about digital that brings all of the data and decisioning to bear that, that the internet can really offer that is what makes it so television is going to get better and better, which is there are going to be fewer ads. They are going to be more relevant. There are going to be highly effective. And that funds content at a rate that has never been seen before, that can only be done by a spot market and a forward market, not a legacy upfront market and scatter market. So those are the reasons, why there’s a big difference in rhetoric around scatter versus spot. The spot market is amazingly strong, the strongest it has ever been. And that’s because of the variety of apps that are coming into the ecosystem and the need for ad funded content because all of them need ad dollars in order to continue to fund their content making machines.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Vasily.\\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is live.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, could you just spend a little more talking about – a little more time talking about what the Disney partnership means for your business? How much access does this deal give you to Disney’s premium CTV inventory and to what magnitude does it grow your footprint for UID? That’s my first question. And my second is for Blake just around hiring plans. We’ve definitely heard a lot of companies in the ad industry pulling back on hiring. So just would love to hear where you guys sit on hiring plans for 2022. Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Awesome. Thanks. I’ll go first and I’ll let Blake go and just to order you asked the question. So let me first just reiterate our strategy in UID2. So first, we created UID2. We open sourced it, we gave it to the ecosystem. This is not ours, but it is something that we really want to see successful because we think there needs to be a privacy safe currency that makes it possible for personalization to take place at large scale. That needs to replace cookies, but it also needs to do way more than that. And when people reduce it down to a discussion about replacing cookies, it doesn’t really capture what it’s about. It is a currency of the Internet that makes personalization and privacy control way better than it exists today. The way that you win that way, the way that you fix the infrastructure of the Internet, which can be massively upgraded, especially so that consumers have more control over privacy is that you partner with the infrastructure. Many might mistakenly think the way that you change the infrastructure of the Internet as you partner with millions of publishers or millions of apps or hundreds of content creators in television. And instead, it’s to start with the infrastructure. So the deal with Disney wouldn’t have easily been done if we hadn’t already partnered with Salesforce or Snowflake or a Adobe or AWS, some of those infrastructure plays that make it possible. But because we had it made it easy for us to then have great conversations with Disney. Additionally, Disney has done an amazing job of assembling all of its different assets, including Hulu, which was one of the first Connected TV plays to really understand the benefit of highly relevant ads and high CPMs that come from relevance. And that you of course have to have a strategy around identity and personalization in order to get those high CPMs and in order to get that benefit. So I think one of the things that Disney has really led the way on is making certain that all the way at the top of their technical organization, they have a clear understanding of what it takes to provide personalization and consumer privacy protection and control at the same time. And while doing that, I think that they have made it possible to better monetize Hulu, ESPN, ABC, Disney+, FX, and so many other things that they own. Because they own so many of those and because I think they understand that relationship at the highest levels of the organization, I think this partnership is really significant, because number one, I think Disney has a clear strategy going forward that some others don’t. And two, I think we’ve established ourselves as a great partner of theirs, and we continue to provide them with an amazing amount of demand and high CPMs that is going to fuel their business and better content. Because they represent such a significant amount of the inventory, and especially because almost everything in CTV is logged in, this represents a massive step forward for UID for an authenticated Internet for a better internet. And when you look at extended runway for cookies going away, as well as just the need for CTV to get a better at monetizing. This represents a move forward for everyone. So I do think Disney is proving itself to be a leader once again. So it’s hard to overstate the significance of the partnership. Blake?\\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. James, regarding your question on the hiring, I just would take just a real quick moment to step back a little bit. If we think about where we are in our business, we have – we’re in one of the greatest situations I think a company could ask for, right. We’ve got high top line growth, high EBITDA growth with strong margins and we also generate solid consistent annual free cash flow. And so having those three things operating together for me, it’s got super special meaning as you can imagine. And what it does is it gives us the opportunity and the ability to be deliberate with our choices. And in doing so, I’m also proud of our ability to stay disciplined with those investments, regardless of the operating environment that we’re in. You mentioned what other companies are doing. And based on what we’re hearing, well, there are many of our peers that might have more resources, that are pausing, hiring or cutting investments because they invested too aggressively. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple years like I – it sounds like many companies did. And I think that’s really paid off for us. It’s given us the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and including hiring, which is one of the largest ones that we will entertain. And so like we mentioned earlier this year, we expect to increase the pace of our investments as we focus on the long-term growth of the business, but we’re always going to stay mindful of long-term productivity supported by our business model. So with regards to hiring and how it affects expenses and such, our Q2 EBITDA was super strong and that included our first full company in-person event that we had in over three years. Our Q3 forecast reflects that investment thesis that we can continue to generate strong EBITDA and invest for the long-term. And we’re focused in hiring in areas that fuel our growth, whether that’s engineering or business development or account management roles. And so I’m comfortable with the trajectory that we’re on and where things stand. And I really think that we can pursue those investments in an operating expense structure that we believe is actually better than pre-pandemic. So I really like the position we’re in to drive more efficiency, more EBITDA and free cash flow, but also as we scale. And so I’m really excited about our situation there.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, James.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. And obviously congrats on a really strong performance all things considered. Jeff with the – with Netflix going with Microsoft and Xandr being SSP, but also DSP itself. What does that mean for the Trade Desk opportunity with Netflix over time? And as there is going to be a great deal of inventory coming into the CTV market from Netflix, and I guess others just, could that be a depressing factor for pricing for Connected TV in the short and medium-term? Then Blake, maybe just a quick one with Solimar’s adoption at now a 100%. I think that’s what you said in the prepared remarks. Anyway to help quantify the contribution of that software upgrade to the outperformance this quarter. Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Youssef for the question. I actually was hoping somebody would ask about Netflix and Microsoft, because I think it’s one of the most exciting scenes that’s happened in our space in it in the quarter. So let me first just restate something that, that Netflix stated on their earnings call, which I think is a direct quote, it’s still early days. So Netflix has been like learning about the advertising business or in the advertising business for only a few months as they’re – have established a very important, but early partnership. But I – for one was very excited when I learned that they had selected Microsoft for a number of reasons, as many of you know, I worked at Microsoft before I sold the first ad exchange to Microsoft. I in fact introduced the President of the ads division to – at the time, the CEO of AppNexus, which later became Xandr. So it’s been a part of my personal journey, as well as the fact that I’ve just been very close to AppNexus and Xandr, of course, Xandr now being owned by Microsoft. Xandr, as you point out Youssef, it has a small DSP, but it is primarily an SSP. They primarily focus on the sell side. If you look at the – if you were to stack rank the major players of demand for CTV, I think you’d find that we are the largest and somewhere around number 10 near the bottom of the top 10 list would be Xandr in terms of size. I would estimate that they provide less than 10% of the demand to other independent inventory or content companies. So as a result, what I think that means for us and for the open Internet is that the role that Microsoft is going to play for Netflix is one where they are helping them get started. They’re helping them create a clear identity strategy. I think they very clearly are going to have to have a strategy both for identity, as well as for monetization that involves the open Internet. Because this is early days, it’s less important to me about the role the Trade Desk plays with Netflix in the crawl phase than it does in the walk and the run phase. And to me, selecting Microsoft makes it, so it’s nearly inevitable that Netflix will be a part of the open Internet and that they’ll welcome demand from lots of different places. And that will be the only way that they can maximize their inventory and get the highest CPMs possible, as somebody who wants to see Netflix do well and has a strong relationship with Netflix leadership. I think this is a solid plan. It’s a great start. There’s a lot of work ahead of them, but I think that we are extremely likely to have a great partnership with them over the long-term, but there’s a lot of stuff that has to be done in order for Netflix to be the leader in AVOD that they’ve been in SVOD. So – but I’m looking forward to it.\\nBlake Grayson: And then with regards to your question on Solimar is a high. I’m really excited about the traction that we’ve seen that I think the product really separates us from the competition and we did reach a 100% usage. I think that it took us about a year to get there. I think the last major product update check like 50% longer in the amount of time it took. So it’s a real Testament to the team and the value that I think we’re providing the customers that are doing that upgrade. And so on a usage basis, the trends look good like average data elements used per impression, it’s more than doubled for the same customers on our previous platform. Average channel usage has increased over 50%. And then the AI, machine learning element that we have the adoption on that on Solimar, I think it increased around 50% versus the prior platform. And this is all about getting customers a better ROI. If we can do that, they’re going to return again for future campaigns and we think it – what that does is it spins the flywheel for everybody for us included. And so just really excited about the momentum here and really proud actually what the team was able to deliver.\\nYoussef Squali: Thank you, both.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef.\\nOperator: Okay. Up next we have Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is live.\\nTim Nollen: I peak my interest, especially about the spot market response a few questions ago being a forward market and how it’s different from scatter. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks about a forward market product. I wonder if you could help maybe explain a bit more, what that is. Is this something that sets you up for more of a upfront participation for CTV guaranteed deals next year or maybe just a bit more color on what that is. And then I’m assuming Unified ID 2.0 will factor in to all of this. And you said you’re optimistic about this becoming kind of a transaction standard for this year. Would UID2 be playing a more prominent role in measurement or attribution of CTV ads going forward?\\nJeff Green: Thanks for the questions, Tim. So maybe aside from CTV, my favorite topic to talk about is actually forward market. And I especially love to talk about it in the context of investors, just because you live the concept every single day, even though, it’s somewhat more into advertising. So first of all, the upfront this process where you commit to buy ads on television was a process that was created in the early 60s. In fact, we’ve sort of jokingly made comparison, maybe half jokingly made comparison to the fact that the audio cassette was invented the same year that the TV upfronts were and audio cassettes obviously have evolved, we don’t use them anymore in our daily lives, but the upfront hasn’t changed much and the process is exactly the same. You have a party or an event, where you commit dollars to advertising for the better part of the year with the absence of data and transactions like it’s just – in a way it’s even strange that as an industry it’s still happens that way. I mean, if we had a forward market for tulips, that was exactly the same as it was 400 years ago. We would look for ways to evolve. We would do something different. So the forward market that we’re developing with our partners is much more like a commodities market, where you have forward contracts, you use data and forecasting to get the benefits of commitment. And the thing that is really amazing about TV ads in particular is that publishers are willing to take less money if you’ll commit to buy it in advance. And advertisers are willing to pay more money, if they can have the assurance that they’re going to get it. I mean, imagine, you wouldn’t spend $3 million, $4 million or $5 million to make a Super Bowl ad, if you didn’t know it was going to run during the Super Bowl. So commitments can be a really important part of television. And so as we move to CTVs, there’s no reason to create a rudimentary 1960s version of a forward market. We should create one that leverages all the very best parts of programmatic takes all the learnings of commodities markets and utilizes that very – the very best things about programmatic. So we’ve developed that its early days, but we have a good commitment from both buyers and sellers to make it possible to create a much better and stronger market. The only way that that works is if you have good forecasting and the only way that that works is if you have a common currency like UID2. So two – the second part of your question, does UID2 play a significant role in that? Absolutely. Because in order for us to give a common understanding to buyers to sellers, it’s one thing to buy in the spot market where you’re buying an ad for less than a penny in almost every case. It’s another thing to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in advance to buying ads. You need a greater degree of assurance. You need greater transparency. You need visibility that can only come from forecasts where you have a common understanding, common currencies become very important in order to have any market other than a spot market, unless you’re operating in discounts and constantly working on make goods, which is exactly what the upfront and scatter markets do in traditional television. Thanks, Tim.\\nOperator: Okay. Next we have Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try two, please. So, Jeff for the business, there have always been several growth factors or growth vectors from international to shopper marketing to CTV to Solimar to UID2. Now with Solimar fully integrated and CTV clearly driving growth. How about the other three, the UID2, international and shopper marketing? Does the extension of cookies – cookie deprecation change your focus or investment towards UID2? And then how are you thinking about international and shopper marketing in general over the next six to, call it, 18 months. And then a question for Blake, is possible to get the magnitude of contribution from retail or Walmart and other partnerships, as well as political spend for the third quarter. That’s baked in your guide. Thank you very much.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I’m glad you’ve asked about just these other growth drivers and of course, how does UID affect it and especially just how does the deprecation of cookies affect UID and international expansion and shopper marketing? So I’m not certain that we made this as clear as we could’ve in the prepared remarks. Cookies and ads that are bought inside a browser, because cookies are only relevant inside of a browser at least directly relevant inside of a browser, represents a small percentage of our business. Display is a small percentage of our business. It’s – as a percentage, it’s shrinking, even though, we’ve seen growth, because growth in other areas are growing faster. It’s still continues to shrink. So it’s a small slice of the pie. What are much bigger are things like mobile, which don’t rely on cookies or CTV, which don’t rely on cookies. They have other ways of creating identity. That, of course, in CTV, nearly everything you do is on the other side of a login, meaning you log into Netflix or you log to Amazon or you log into Peacock or Paramount or Hulu before you view content. And that makes it very prone to be interoperable with something like UID2. So there’s no cookie problem to solve in TV, but everybody in TV needs more subscribers, and I believe everybody in TV needs to offer an AVOD solution for those subscribers that would rather pay with their time than with money. And especially when you have to keep providing or making rate hikes in order to pay for incremental content. So the cookie changes don’t slow down UID at all. And in fact, I’ve always said that the biggest threat to the walled gardens is the competitive nature of Connected Television. That’s especially true in identity and the competitive nature of television is really what I think will fuel UID forward faster than anything that happens with cookies delay or not. But the same thing is true internationally. I mean, especially if you look at the places where GDP growth is predicted to be the highest in the world, those are places that are often mobile first, so they’re less reliant on cookies as well, so especially in Asia. So business models that have a holistic approach to identity and can customize ads to think holistically are the ones that are going to do the best, especially for the biggest companies in the world, which is why I think we’re really in a strong position for international growth. And thirdly, as it relates to international, I think it’s fair to say, there’s more likely to be economic headwinds outside the United States than inside the United States. It given that we look at this as land grab time. So there is a big opportunity for us to expand our market share. Even if there are economic headwinds internationally, that we just want to continue to invest in, especially because outside of big competitors like the Google’s of the world where their DSP is not their primary focus for those smaller competitors where being a DSP is their primary focus. They’re often much smaller and can’t afford to make those investments. So there’s a big opportunity for us to expand around the world. And then in shopper marketing, it – there is this incredible desire, especially inside of CPGs, and CPGs for a whole bunch of reasons, including inflation are under pressure to do more with less. And what can really help them is to see end-to-end. If I show an ad to this person, how did it affect whether they buy it, add a store to see end-to-end, the impact of their spend is extremely valuable to them. And retailers know that that is a way for them to spin their flywheels faster. Initially they looked at it as a way to make more money on selling data, but now they look at it as a way to spin their flywheels faster. And so I think it’s one of the surest ways that we will spin our own flywheel is to continue to enable an open internet where there’s lots of competition and where marketers that sell goods inside of stores, brick-and-mortar stores continue to get the data driven benefits that historically have been reserved for online retailers like Amazon. So, where everybody is looking at competing with Amazon, they know they have to be focused on becoming as data driven or more than they are. And we’re just seeing amazing strides in retail that, that contributes to our shopper marketing strategy. So, we’ve just seen our TAM expand in the short term, just because of this focus of moving to fixing this sort of end-to-end challenge. And I do think it is true that the discussion about the demise of cookies has made that faster, even though it’s a totally different aspect of measurement, but it is improved and accelerated the move to better measurement, which I don’t know that there’s any place that’s better off in those places where we’re doing end-to-end measurement and shopper marketing,\\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up sort to on your other questions, I think, on the shopper marketing component, we don’t break out that level of detail in our shopper marketing business. The only thing I could just say is that, we are seeing the spend ramp, it ramped into Q2 is more large brands, test our testing and adopting it and we expect that to continue. I think just the selection opportunity that our customers are going, are now having is going to be a flywheel spin for them that I debate in my head, whether they’re going to be able to get it very many other places, if any. And so I think that’s just such a long-term opportunity for us like Jeff said, I’m just; I’m super excited about it. And then with regards to your question on political, in the midterms, the spend will occur much closer to Election Day than we might find in a presidential year, like we expect to see that start ramping here over the late summer. I would say through November, there’s so many races out there that are going to be competitive, and we’ll just have to see how competitive, whether it’s the House the Senate, governor campaigns or whatnot. I think that our overall expectation, and is that the in Q3, we expected to be a low single-digit percentage spend in Q3. And that was in our prepared remarks as well. But overall just with regards to political, what I would say is, our goal is to it’s to run a better process, it’s to earn trust with our customers. We’ve been building this business over quite a few years. We’ve got really high retention rates with our customers. We do believe, we’re the go to platform for digital advertising now versus maybe other social media platforms. And so we do expect some tailwinds. That’s why we called it out in the guidance, but we’ll have to see how this all unfolds into the back half of the year.\\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks.\\nJeff Green: And then John, we can squeeze in one more.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys for squeezing me in this. Just as a quick follow up to the forwarded market concept. We wanted to ask about refundability or resalability of inventory, if you will. If an advertiser takes delivery, for example, finds out that an impression or a consumer is already a customer Jeff, are you envisioning that advertisers would’ve the ability to resale inventory and any thoughts on the dynamics there in terms of market liquidity, and participation, and really potential financialization of the market? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I think at initially what you’re going to want to see is control from both publishers or content owners and advertisers in terms of who shows up? Who has access to it? But I do think that in the long term, and we’re talking years from now, one way that you can get buyers to sign up is if they buy too much, they can sell it to somebody else. And so I do think it’s possible to see a derivatives market exist sort of on top of that forward market, so that you can essentially transact in the rights to buy those so that you can secure inventory. But making them fungible makes it, or resellable, or both rather, as I think a really important part of the market in the long term. So, I do think that that component will exist in the long-term, but the most important thing in the short term is to take advantage of the fact that you can bring data to bear that publishers want guarantees and all the benefits of programmatic advertisers would like to reserve inventory and have all the benefits of programmatic, which includes the ability for them to bring their data into the equation. In traditional television, as well as in the scatter market, advertisers can’t really bring their own data to the table. So, the forward market would enable them to do that, which would help prices go up and is really going to benefit, both the buyer and the seller. I think there’s going to be a lot of rules that exist for years to prevent the resale of that. But I do think long-term the economic incentives are there for that to exist. It creates an amazing market. And I don’t think that there’s any company that’s better positioned to benefit from this market than The Trade Desk, because of the role that we play by looking at everything by looking at nearly all inventory, because we don’t own it. We make it possible to partner with all of it. And I think we can easily become once again, the world leader in providing demand, not just in the spot market, which we already are today, but also in the forward market, which is why we’re working so hard to create it, and leverage the relationships that we’ve been tending to for more than a decade now.\\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Brian.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

       "  Document(page_content='Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; and Executive Vice President of Finance, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\\'s operational performance. With that, I\\'ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you\\'ve seen from our press release, we are off to a very strong start in 2023. We reported first quarter revenue of $383 million, representing growth of 21% compared with last year, again exceeding our own expectations. And has been in the case in the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We are gaining market share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Even as most brands and advertisers continue to deal with some level of uncertainty, they are increasingly shifting more of their campaign dollars to decision, data-driven opportunities, where they can have more confidence that those dollars are working as hard as possible. As a result, we are signing multiyear joint business plans, JBPs; with the leading agencies and brands, some of which represent spend projections that exceed $1 billion. From the beginning, our goal has been to align our incentives with the buy side. This continues today. Because we do not own any media and because of our unwavering commitment to the demand side, our clients trust that we represent their interest alone and we continue to innovate our platform to bring maximum value and ROI for their brand and agency campaigns. With that in mind, I\\'d like to focus my comments today on a few key areas. First, CTV; second, AI, including generative AI; third, agility; and fourth, the combination of OpenPath and identity. So first, the transformational impact of CTV. In the first quarter, video which includes CTV, was the fastest-growing channel of our business. And our CTV growth is not just here in the United States. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. As I\\'ve said before, the shift to CTV is driving significant change, not only in TV advertising but also in omnichannel advertising. In other words, our whole business. Many campaigns are now starting with high-value CTV impressions with carefully monitored reach and frequency. As part of an omnichannel campaign, these impressions are then followed up with less expensive display, audio, mobile and native ads to move the user down the funnel. The focus on the transformational nature of CTV is never more apparent than at this time of year as major networks work to sell as much of their inventory as possible in advance through the annual spring upfront process. As the upfronts kick into gear, the role of programmatic CTV advertising is increasingly top of mind for our agency and brand clients. In recent years, upfronts have been charging higher CPMs for less reach in broadcast TV which only serves to assign more clarity on the value of digital and CTV. Add to that, the current writers’ strike undoubtedly time deliberately and we expect more dollars to flow into the spot market, programmatic and decision TV. As a result, I expect CTV to play a more central role than ever in this year\\'s upfront. Rave [ph] summarized recent trends in an article a couple of weeks ago that I quote, \"Advertisers are requesting new deal terms with the major streaming TV companies ahead of this year\\'s spring ad haggle, including how brands spend through programmatic platforms.\" In some cases, brands and agencies are asking streaming publishers to let The Trade Desk be a part of the deals. The shift to decision CTV was reinforced at our recent Forward \\'23 CTV event in New York City, where most of the major streaming media companies joined us on stage to talk about how they are innovating in CTV to bring value to the world\\'s top advertisers. Paramount talked about how advertisers are incorporating data, identity and optimization into the upfronts. Disney spoke about the multiyear transition taking place in CTV, much of it hinging on advances in addressability made possible by CTV. Also at Forward \\'23, NBCU made the big announcement that they have adopted UID2. They are integrating UID2 in order to ensure a premium CTV experience with low ad loads and frequency controls for advertisers. Across the board, UID2 is accelerating as the primary currency or CTV decisioning. As we\\'ve discussed previously, biddable marketplaces are inevitable for media companies to maximize demand and compete in the CTV content arms race. This only becomes more true as the streaming wars intensify each year. By the way, this also makes integration with The Trade Desk somewhat inevitable for all major streaming platforms as they scale because they need as much demand as possible to their platforms. Even Netflix, a company who just launched their advertising business model at the end of last year, highlighted on their earnings call a few weeks ago that the ad-funded subscriber is more valuable to them than the ad-free subscriber. Hulu has said the same thing for years. Even in the early days of the market, ad-supported streaming is proving to be the most effective engine for growth and value and that is even before Netflix brings the power of identity and biddable marketplaces to the table. With a critical mass of premium CTV inventory available across a wide range of platforms, our advertising clients are eager to embrace the power of decisioning in their TV campaigns and many of them are working with us to drive new innovations in CTV to get the maximum value from their investments. Recently, we launched a new product, The TV Quality Index, or TVQI for short. It helps advertisers understand the quality of the ad experience that the consumer is having. The index analyzes consumer perceptions of different streaming platforms, ad relevance and publisher signals to ensure that each campaign targets the most relevant inventory to any specific audience group. It also helps advertisers compare the impact of premium video against the C of UGC skippable ads. One of our large independent agency clients, Tombras recently ran a campaign for one of their large global banking customers. Tombras wanted to understand how CTV could help increase brand awareness and favorability. With TV QI, Tombras was able to see where increases in the index score drove meaningfully higher brand lift. In this particular campaign, Tombras was able to drive a 22.5% lift in awareness and a 17% improvement in favorability by focusing on high scoring inventory from HBO Max and Discovery Plus based on TVQI. The TV inventory quality is particularly important to advertisers when thinking about premium CTV content compared to the user-generated video content that often characterizes walled gardens. This was a priority for Sinyi Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Taiwan for an omnichannel campaign that they recently ran on the trade desk. Sinyi wanted to boost its business by reaching more sellers and they had previously relied on social media marketing against UGC. With The Trade Desk, however, Sinyi was able to significantly expand targeted reach and improve performance with an omnichannel campaign that embrace CTV, online video and display advertising, allowing them to maximize precision and optimize frequency across all those channels at once. Sinyi onboarded their valuable first-party data, leverage UID2 to find new target audiences and use third-party behavioral data to find people interested in real estate and related topics, including consumers who had recently purchased home decoration products. With this approach, Sinyi was able to significantly expand their target audience, outperforming every one of their key KPIs. Indeed, Sinyi\\'s video advertising assets performed twice as well as their previous GC campaigns. I think it\\'s also worth noting that while we spend a lot of time talking about the transformational nature of CTV, Sinyi\\'s experience is a typical one of many of our clients. As I mentioned before, CTV is often just a starting point. Very few advertisers execute in CTV alone. Almost all of them want to bring decisioning to their TV spend so that they can be more data-driven across all advertising channels and the emergence of premium CTV inventory at scale now enables that omnichannel optimization. Next, I\\'d like to talk about artificial intelligence and our focus on innovation. AI has always been a very strategic focus of The Trade Desk and we\\'re confident that once again, we\\'re in a leading position. In our original business plan, we said that our technology had to be a fusion of human and machine. Our initial products reflected that paradigm. Humans are often best at creating hypotheses, especially about how to emotionally connect with other people, something that is key to the success of any advertising campaign. At the same time, machines can often test those hypotheses and constantly learn from new data. In 2018, AI was deployed throughout The Trade Desk product in enough places that we launched a brand that year, Koa. To our users, Koa denotes the presence of TTD\\'s proprietary AI learning technology that generates recommendations and optimizations. When we launched Koa in 2018, we used the analogy of the copilot, where our thousands of daily users are the pilots and our generative AI recommendation serve as their copilot. More and more of our users have these features turned on as a default because they know that they\\'re getting AI-driven insights and optimizations constantly applied to their campaigns. I love what the CEO of Coca-Cola said publicly after their earnings a few weeks ago. And I quote, \"Much has been said about AI and it\\'s certainly going to abate the maxim. Profound transformative technology is often overestimated in its impact in the short term and underestimated in the long term. This is going to have a profound impact, profound internally for the way our business operates but also how we engage with consumers.\" He then added, \"I think AI is going to make a huge impact in marketing.\" With that in mind, not enough has been said about what it takes to make great AI. ChatGPT is an amazing technology but its usefulness is conditioned on the quality of the dataset it is pointed at. Regurgitating bad data, bad opinions or fake news, where AI generated deep bases, for example, will be a problem that all generative AI will likely be dealing with for decades to come. We believe many of the novel AI use cases in market today will face challenges with monetization and copyright and data integrity or truth and scale. By contrast, we are so excited about our position in the advertising ecosystem when it comes to AI. We look at over 10 million ad requests every second. Those requests, in sum, represent a very robust and very unique dataset with incredible integrity. We can point generative AI at that dataset with confidence for years to come. We know that our size, our dataset size and integrity, our profitability and our team will make Koa and generative AI a promising part of our future. In the future, you\\'ll also hear us talk about other applications of AI in our business. These include generating code faster; changing the way customers understand and interact with their own data; generating new and more targeted creatives, especially for video and CTV; and using virtual assistance to shorten the learning curve that comes with the complicated world of programmatic advertising by optimizing the documentation process and making it more engaging. We\\'ll have a lot more to say about the role of AI, particularly how it is getting more distributed within our system as well as many other game-changing innovations at our Net Platform Launch event on 66 in New York. It will be the largest platform launch in our history and I even hesitate to call it an upgrade because it is so much more than that. It will encompass a new approach to collaborative innovation, breakthroughs in how we service value for advertisers and expanding accessibility as marketers of all types embrace the power of programmatic. The new release is called Koki and we look forward to sharing new product announcements new ways for partners and clients to adopt and integrate with The Trade Desk and even deeper relationships as a result. For the third topic today, I\\'d like to talk briefly about agility. In our work with the thousands of agencies and brands that utilize our platform, there has been a shift in the discussions we\\'re having over the last 12 months or so. All of our clients are cognizant of the macro market environment, whether it\\'s high interest rates or fears of recession, the stability of the banking system or ongoing supply chain issues. They are also, though, keenly aware of the role that advertising continues to play in helping them drive growth and differentiate their businesses even in times of uncertainty. Because of this, marketing leaders need to be deliberate with advertising budgets. More and more, they are looking to understand where they can shift investments and where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven to find those important opportunities to differentiate and drive growth to their business. And in that environment, the value of The Trade Desk becomes even more apparent. With us, agencies and brands can plan and optimize in real time. They can work in month-to-month increments versus a yearlong or a 6-month plan. A great example of this is FairPrice in Singapore. You may remember that FairPrice is one of our retail media partners. They are the largest grocery chain in Singapore. They are also an advertiser on our platform. Their goal was quite simple. In an increasingly competitive market, FairPrice wanted to reach new customers with a lower acquisition cost. Working with The Trade Desk, they were able to import their valuable first-party data from their loyalty program which comprises more than 2 million customers. Using UID2, they were able to do look-alike modeling to understand where additional potential customers might be targeted, potential customers who share some characteristics of their most loyal customers. And the results were very impressive. When using UID2 to execute that modeling, FairPrice\\'s acquisition cost per customer was 1/3 lower than with traditional identifiers but also with twice the scale. The same trend is happening around the world. One of the world\\'s largest CPG companies, also one of our largest clients, recently highlighted this on their earnings call. They talked about how programmatic was helping them drive significant campaign and media efficiencies, maximizing the ROI of every campaign dollar. This efficiency helped them reinvest in more media and innovation, driving competitive differentiation. The trend towards agility and flexibility plays into the strengths of The Trade Desk. In fact, I would argue that at a time when it can be harder than ever to predict macro market trends, the ability to drive a growth and competitive differentiation agenda using our platform becomes more compelling than ever and we expect this trend to continue regardless of the macro environment. More and more marketing leaders from CMOs to agency leaders, to media planners understand the power of programmatic to thoughtfully drive value. And they are leaning in, whether it\\'s in CTV, retail media, UID2 or any number of other key programmatic innovations. Finally, I\\'d like to discuss UID2 in the OpenPath. I\\'ve mentioned UID a few times on this call already but I\\'d like to touch on the progress we\\'ve made there and with OpenPath in the last few months as well. Much has been written about these innovations in recent weeks, especially about what they might mean for the evolving role of demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms. As I hope you picked up in the client stories I\\'ve shared today, UID2 is much more than a new identity alternative to cookies. It\\'s really about helping our clients drive advertising precision in a privacy-safe way across all advertising channels. As the open Internet continues to grow and evolve, it\\'s essential that we develop new identity currencies that help us preserve the vital value exchange of relevant advertising or free content. Last quarter, I said we expect 75% of the third-party data ecosystem to be activating on UID2 by the middle of the year. I\\'m proud to report today that we are now right at that level with most major third-party data providers leveraging UID2s on our platform. A growing number of publishers are also sending UID2, providing advertisers with greater insight into audience engagement and campaign performance. And as a result, ad spend is increasingly gravitating towards ad impressions that include UID2. It\\'s worth noting that, in some cases, we may see the same ad impression from up to 8 or 9 SSP supply paths on our platform. When this occurs, our clients are more likely to transact on impressions that incorporate UID2 because they have a clearer sense of exactly which audience they are reaching and how those ads are performing. A few weeks ago, for example, Unilever announced that ad impressions, including UID2, on Disney were 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than those with traditional identifiers. This is not atypical and our advertisers are willing to pay for the value of that precision. Indeed, CPMs on ad impressions containing UID2 are meaningfully higher than those without in most channels. In this way, UID2 simply helps advertisers drive as much value as possible from every advertising dollar. The same can be said of OpenPath. To begin the discussion on OpenPath, let me first remind you of what it is. OpenPath is a direct integration from our platform into publisher inventory. It provides our clients with a direct line of sight into premium inventory across channels and it provides publishers with a direct view of what advertisers are willing to pay for their impressions. In no way, shape or form is OpenPath an effort by the Trade Desk to enter the supply side of digital advertising. That is not in our interest. To explain that a bit more clearly, it\\'s worth spending a moment on some of the industry dynamics that make OpenPath compelling for our clients. OpenPath was born of an advertiser interest in having a more clear and transparent path to publisher inventory, where every participant in the supply path is contributing more value than they are extracting in fees. Advertisers have long been aware that there are quite a few hops in the advertising supply chain and neither the price nor the value of each hop has ever been completely clear. We share this concern. And in this way, OpenPath, is very consistent with our long-term commitment to make supply chain optimization and efficiency a reality. Advertisers\\' eagerness for more transparency came at a time when publishers were becoming increasingly frustrated in their ability to manage yield in the complex world of programmatic. Indeed, many of them were starting to do it themselves, with some even launching their own ad servers. And why were they frustrated? It really has a lot to do with Google\\'s dominance of the supply side and the draconian measures they\\'ve taken that hurt publisher revenues. The recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google does a remarkably thorough job of outlining these dynamics. We have long asked the supply side to do a better job of yield management. It\\'s not something we will ever do. We see the impact that Google is having and we believe DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP should have more and better competition from SSPs just as we try to provide on the demand side. But given the state of the supply chain in programmatic which is one where either companies have the power to create change and don\\'t want to or they are too small to have the power to create the change, advertisers want direct integrations and publishers are welcoming them. Many publishers representing thousands of media properties across CTV, mobile and display have already integrated with OpenPath. And our advertisers are increasingly prioritizing direct channels, where they have a clear view of value. For all of the publishers that have integrated, we have a multiple of that number going through the process of getting on board right now. So let me bring this all to a close by highlighting that our work in these areas is made possible by our focus on profitability. In the first quarter, once again, The Trade Desk generated strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain one of the very few high-growth technology companies to consistently do so year after year. Our strong profitability allows us to invest in emerging technologies such as OpenPath and UID2 and deliver them to market, even if development resources are in short supply across our clients and partners. It means we can continue to invest in innovations such as our retail media marketplace, enabling our clients to more effectively measure how specific campaigns drive in-store or online purchases. Just a couple of days ago, we announced a new retail partnership with Macy\\'s here in the United States. In Europe, we recently announced a new partnership with Ocado, a joint venture involving Marks & Spencer and one of U.K.\\'s fastest-growing grocery groups. We now work with many of the world\\'s leading retailers to activate their data for our advertisers and our clients are embracing the opportunity to apply more performance and measurement precision to their retail campaigns. In many cases, this is incremental market opportunity for us. It also means we continue to advance our industry leadership in AI which I mentioned earlier and which we will talk about more on June 6 with the launch of Kokai. Our commitment to industry-leading innovation underpins everything we do. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the market with 21% revenue growth, meaning we continue to gain market share at an impressive pace because we consistently bring innovation value to our clients every single day. The innovation acceleration in programmatic will only continue in 2023 and as more advertisers embrace breakthroughs in CTV, retail, identity and so many other areas. The Trade Desk will stay at the believing edge of this innovation curve. And in doing so, I\\'m optimistic that we will continue to outperform the market, deliver more value to our clients than we extract and gain share. As I hand over the microphone to Blake Grayson, I\\'d like to underscore an announcement that we made in our press release. I\\'m so thrilled to announce the promotion of Laura Schenkein to become our new Chief Financial Officer succeeding Blake, who will be leaving the company for a senior finance role outside of the ad tech industry. First, I\\'d like to thank Blake for the amazing contribution that he\\'s made to this company during his time here in the last few years. I can\\'t imagine having been through this with anyone else, never expected to experience the effects of the pandemic, some very difficult decisions in the middle of 2020 around resource allocation as we were looking into uncharted territories and lots of uncertainty. But I am extremely excited to announce Laura as our new CFO. Laura and I have worked together for about the last 10 years. I\\'ve seen Laura grow as a leader. I think it\\'s fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of Blake during his time here is how much he has mentored and helped Laura to grow. Laura understands our business and on a personal note because I worked with Laura for a decade. I\\'ve come to trust for strategic counsel and her recommendations. I\\'m very proud to call her my partner and our new CFO. And with that, I\\'ll hand it over to Blake to say a few words and cover our financials.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. I am immensely proud of our achievements as a company and it has been an honor to work with Jeff and the leadership team as well as so many talented individuals at The Trade Desk. I\\'m leaving for a new challenge knowing the company is well positioned for the future. Laura is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague and has my full confidence as she assumes her new role. Now on to our results; Q1 was an exceptional quarter of financial performance and execution for The Trade Desk. Q1 revenue was $383 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Our Q1 performance was bolstered by the growing trend toward unbiased, data-driven advertising on the open Internet. This shift has played to the strength of our platform as marketers become more agile and deliberate with their digital advertising. While some macro uncertainty in the market has led to relatively uneven ad budgets, we are seeing increasing numbers of marketers embrace our platform to take advantage of our flexible and data-driven approach. Our success in Q1 was demonstrated by several key achievements. Our performance in the CTV space remains robust and we continue to achieve strong momentum in retail media, further solidifying our position as a leading player in the industry. Strong growth returned to many of our key international offices. The growing adoption of UID2 by major advertisers and publishers speaks to the value that is placed on identity in the open Internet ecosystem. In addition, we deepened our partnerships with clients by expanding our joint business plans on a global level, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing outstanding value and results for our customers. In addition to strong top line performance, in Q1, we generated $109 million in adjusted EBITDA or 28% of revenue, exceeding our own expectations. As it typically occurs, when we outperform on the top line, it generally flows through to our bottom line results as it did in this quarter. This outperformance led to record free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, marking nearly $500 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis which is nearly 10x the free cash flow we generated just 3 years ago. In the current environment, our consistent ability to grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow puts us in a strong position to continue investing for growth and grabbing land while others are forced to pull back. Additionally, I am proud that our robust cash generation allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders for the first time via our share repurchase program. In Q1, growth was broad-based across channels. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected TV continued to be a core driver of our business. From a scaled channel perspective, video which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America accounted for 88% of our Q1 spend, with international representing the remaining 12%. We\\'re pleased to report that international growth slightly outpaced North America during this period, with particularly strong performance in EMEA. Our CTV business in Europe grew well into the triple digits year-over-year in Q1. While CTV growth in North Asia also showed encouraging momentum, with year-over-year CTV spend growth in both regions improving each month. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. As customers seek to optimize their ad spend, The Trade Desk is well positioned to deliver value and drive ROI as we demonstrated in late 2020. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q1 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the pandemic. Food and drink, automotive and home and garden were also among our strongest performing verticals, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses; excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q1 were $293 million, up 41% year-over-year. We continue to invest prudently in our team during the quarter to support our long-term growth objectives. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was partly due to in-person events and travel that did not take place in Q1 of the prior year as we had not yet fully resumed back to office work or in-person events. Unlike many ad-funded and technology peers, we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the past few years, maintaining a focus on profitable growth. As a result, we are well positioned to capture market share and increase spend while generating significant adjusted EBITDA. Our income tax benefit was $19 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $114 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $188 million and free cash flow was a record $177 million in Q1. DSOs exited in the quarter were 88 days and DPOs were 72 days. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In February, upon review of our capital allocation strategy, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $293 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Before I pass the microphone to Laura to cover the outlook for Q2, I\\'ll summarize by saying The Trade Desk is off to a fantastic start in 2023 with strong momentum across the business. Our robust business model and solid balance sheet have positioned us well to succeed in the current environment with powerful secular trends such as the shift from linear to CTV the growing use of data and marketing campaigns and significant long-term growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, joint business plans and gaining share in international markets, we are highly optimistic about the potential to continue growing and capturing market share in the years ahead. And with that, I\\'ll hand it over to Laura.\\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Blake. And thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. I\\'m incredibly excited to be taking on the CFO role starting next month. I feel fortunate to have worked with Blake these last 3.5 years. It\\'s because of his and Jeff\\'s mentorship that I feel well prepared to take the baton and build upon the strong foundation they\\'ve set for CTV\\'s future. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $452 million which would represent growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year would be about 21% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $160 million in Q2. As Jeff has outlined, with the large addressable market in front of us, we see significant growth opportunities and continue to invest thoughtfully in the business. We continue to be one of the few technology companies capable of consistently generating high top line growth, significant adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as platform renovation, customer service identity and supply chain optimization. In addition, this year, we remain focused on hiring to support future growth, although at about half the rate of 2022 as we expect our year-over-year headcount growth to continue to decelerate as we progress throughout the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let\\'s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the strong performance. And Laura, congrats to you. And Blake, all the best. I just have one question. Jeff, we\\'re hearing a lot about walled gardens starting to open up and this is something that you\\'ve talked about for a while now. Could you just talk about what you\\'re actually seeing on this front? And how you think about the benefits and the timing of benefits to Trade Desk from this move?\\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the kind words and also the question. So let me start by just restating something that I\\'ve said many times over the years. I do not believe the walled garden strategy is a good long-term strategy for anyone. That includes even the biggest, the Googles and Facebooks and Baidus, Alibabas and Tencents [ph] of the world. But it\\'s especially bad for the smaller walled gardens. And there are a lot of players that have been essentially comping the Google, Facebook playbook and creating friction to buy their inventory. And as I\\'ve said before, I think that the cracks in that strategy or in those walls show up in proportion to size and they\\'re the result of sort of economic pressure that when you have more supply than demand, you want to welcome more demand and not make it harder to buy your inventory. So it\\'s natural that in an environment where there\\'s a lot of pressure and, certainly, the advent of CTV makes, so there\\'s more options in the open Internet than there\\'s ever been before that, that puts pressure on all walled gardens but especially those that are smaller. So you might be commenting on a number of specific companies who\\'ve been more public in the market, talking about how they\\'re opening up. And they\\'re using phrases like \"We\\'re opening to other demand.\" And that\\'s very exciting for us and I do think that\\'s indicative of what\\'s to come. One thing I just want to encourage everybody to do, though, is to scrutinize the type of demand that they\\'re opening up when inventory is available in price discoverable ways, where we can bid on it and understand exactly what we\\'re bidding and not just plug into an API and transfer budgets but to actually know what we\\'re buying and do what we do in the rest of the Internet and with our core business. That is extremely exciting to us. When you can layer on top of an identity which, of course, we\\'re going to talk more about in UID undoubtedly, that also creates just opportunity for higher prices for them, more price discovery for us and that\\'s the sort of everyone wins situation. And we\\'re seeing more and more talk about moving in that direction. We\\'re seeing some movements heading in that direction. I\\'m very optimistic that, that will continue. But right now, there\\'s a lot of early discussions and that\\'s just the byproduct, I think, of just some of the economic pressures and the alternatives and also the advent and success of UID2. So all of that together, I think, is really creating yet another secular tailwind in our favor. So very excited about it and appreciate the question, Shyam. Thank you.\\nOperator: Next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Great. I\\'d also like to issue my congratulations to Laura and best wishes to Blake. My question for Jeff. There\\'s a perception that shopper marketing is just a new form of targeting. Could you express your views on this? And just how measurement in the approach to marketing efficacy has changed with this approach versus that retargeting model of the past?\\nJeffrey Green: Thank you, again, for the kind of words. And I really appreciate this question. If I do this well, I can avoid writing another offense because this is something that\\'s been on my mind for a little while. And I\\'m just -- I\\'m so glad you\\'ve asked the question. So those that have argued that shopper marketing is just a new form of retargeting don\\'t really understand the significance of what is happening in shopper marketing. So if you, first of all, sort of visualize the purchase funnel, where at the top, you\\'re creating awareness, it\\'s also where most of the surface area of the funnel is and at the bottom is where a purchase gets made. Retargeting is a small sliver in the middle of that purchase funnel, where somebody has expressed interest with the shopping cart. They filled it out but then they didn\\'t actually purchase. And so then you -- if you do it badly, the way often our industry does, you just harass the person until they buy it. If you do it well, then you do that in a metered approach. But it is just a small sliver of the marketing budget that is spent to get the customers that almost got to the finish line but didn\\'t. Shopper marketing is the entire funnel. It is a new segment that widens the entire funnel, where, first of all, you\\'re able to measure all the way to the very bottom of the funnel. So you\\'re able to see who actually went to Walmart and bought the razor. And if they did buy the razor, now it can look alike model and go find 100,000 people that look just like them. And then I go create new awareness and I move them down the funnel. Will retargeting be a part of that? Of course, just like all the other effective parts of the purchase funnel. But the real beauty of shopper marketing is that you\\'re creating new look-alike modeling at the very top of the funnel to find 100,000 people or more. They just like the people that bought the product and then you\\'re able to measure all the way down to the bond and say these are the people that actually bought the product. And that last piece that has been missing, there\\'s been a whole lung of proxy metrics and measurement that has been used to argue, especially from walled gardens that they\\'re the ones that have driven all the sales and this is really the first and very best way at scale to say we\\'re selling product that is directly related to the marketing that we\\'ve been doing before. So if you\\'re anything that sells product in brick-and-mortar and I don\\'t want to suggest that it\\'s isolated to brick-and-mortar, it\\'s not, you can do the exact same thing online but there\\'s just such a strategic pressure on those that are in brick-and-mortar. When you think about, for instance, Walmart or Target, we were both partners, of course, trying to compete with Amazon, that the way that they leverage their strengths in being a brick-and-mortar, where Amazon mostly isn\\'t, is for them to see how they can take off-line measurement and apply it to online marketing and complete the entire purchase funnel and quite literally widen that purchase funnel. Lastly, I just want to underscore that in a very short amount of time, this has been -- this has become a big part of our business, not only does it widen the TAM but we just have amazing success stories with Walmart and Target and Walgreens and Albertsons and Kroger and then so many others, the flyboys, the boots, so many others around the world. But I\\'m very excited about our most recent announcement just a few days ago with Macy\\'s, where so much of what we\\'ve been doing is in grocery stores and convenience stores and those types, albeit all over the world, including like the GoJets of Indonesia and just so many others. But Macy\\'s is the first time that we\\'re really getting into more clothing and fashion and a totally different part of the economy and we expect that partnership to continue to pay dividends for years to come; so very excited about it. I really appreciate the question because it is so much more than simply retargeting, so I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. Thanks for saving me.\\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Wanted to ask a question about OpenPath and SPO. When I read the industry blogs and press. It seems like the peering DSPs and SSPs against each other\\'s competitors. There is a narrative we talk about each player trying to disentimidiate and charge the other players. So it seems very hostile environment in the industry right now according to the industry press. So Jeff, could you provide us your view on what really is going on there and where we\\'re going with respect to supply chain optimization here?\\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. Thank you for the question. It\\'s funny. The last one I said, thanks for saying in Open, almost done with the open in this one which will come out early next week on the current. But I really appreciate the question because I do feel like there\\'s a phenomenon here that feels a little bit like reality TV or something, where there\\'s just so much effort to create drama in our space including in places where there is in drama, that I appreciate the chance to clarify. So let me just reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks. OpenPath is a product that directly integrates with publishers and content owners so that they can see the demand that we\\'re bringing. It is not us getting into yield management, where we\\'re providing the service to publishers and content owners to get them the highest CPM possible. Because for the most part, we\\'re trying to get lower CPMs on behalf of buyers. They want the best value which is they want something that\\'s going to perform and give them great brand equity but they want to pay as little as they have to, to get that. That\\'s for the most part, the exact opposite of what publishers want. So we can\\'t play both sides without creating the conflict of interest that we\\'re extremely critical of in walled garden. So we wouldn\\'t sign up to go do that, given how public we are in our criticisms of those that try. And so -- but I will say that the supply chain of digital advertising is extremely convoluted and there\\'s lots of inefficiencies and complexity. I think it\\'s one of the most complicated supply chain of any scaled market in the world. And I do believe that it\\'s impossible to talk about this topic without talking about Google because they often sit in the middle, largely because of the technology that was formerly called DFP that now is part of GAM, Google Ad Manager. That, according to the Department of Justice lawsuit, has almost 90% market share. So when they have that sort of market share and they have a business model that is deliberately opaque, it becomes very difficult to see what everyone else is doing. So there are a number of initiatives to create greater transparency. You\\'ve heard about a clear line from Magnite potentially. You\\'ve heard about a new product Pelotenticate from Pragmatic. But really, what everybody is trying to do is create clearer supply chains and make it so that there are less hoops and duplication, that every single impression is running through. When I say everyone is trying to do that, I think those that are being loudest and those that are biggest. There are, of course, players in the supply chain that are trying to exploit the opaqueness and there are small players and big players trying to do that. And so what OpenPath does is it creates a baseline to compare all those against. Over time, we\\'ll continue to make certain that we don\\'t spend on paths that are less efficient and OpenPath gives us that benchmark or that baseline to make certain that we don\\'t do that. And we think, over time, those that are trying to do the right thing and create a more effective supply chain, they\\'re going to be rewarded by our efforts and their efforts to be more transparent and more open about what we\\'re buying and selling. But this is not us trying to compete with the sell side. This is not us declaring more on the sell side. We are declaring more on inefficiency. We are declaring more on those players that are trying to do the wrong thing. And honestly, it\\'s hard on some days to tell who\\'s trying to do the right thing and who\\'s doing the wrong thing. So we just developed the technology that exposes the math that makes certain that price discovery wins, that make certain that people are passing the metadata so the price discovery can actually happen. Because on a significant amount of impressions, it doesn\\'t. And over time, you\\'re going to see us just continue to reward those players that enable price discovery and punish those that don\\'t as it relates to where we take our business. But I expect the supply chain to continue to get more effective. OpenPath is a critical part of that. We\\'re excited to have the support of most of the scaled, open Internet ad tech. And every now and again, there\\'s something critical written in the press. And honestly, I think that\\'s often them looking for drama. And I think they\\'ve learned over time that if you write something about The Trade Desk, you get clicks. But that\\'s different than what\\'s actually happening sometimes.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist.\\nYoussef Squali: And congrats on the solid quarter. Blake, best of luck. And Laura, congrats on the new assignment. So Jeff, on AI, I think we can all see the potential impacts on content creation, ad copy, A/B testing, et cetera, et cetera. I\\'d love to hear your thought as to how AI is likely to potentially impact the competitive landscape within your industry. Does that give a potentially competitive advantage to those that have been investing in the technology maybe a little longer than others? And how are you guys, in particular, how is Trade Desk kind of inserting more and more of the new capabilities into your product road map?\\nJeffrey Green: Amazing. First of all, thank you so much for the question. If I could have chosen the questions today, I probably would have chosen those similar to this, I probably would have moved AI actually up. I\\'m almost shocked that we got through 3 questions without talking about AI, so I\\'m so excited to talk about it. I\\'ve never seen a topic that is so hot or hotter than what AI is right now, not cloud, not blockchain. I don\\'t even know that dot-com 20 years ago was hotter than AI is right now. So I\\'m excited that we\\'re talking about it but this is not a new topic for us. So first of all, when we first wrote our business plan, we talked about how this was the fusion of man and machine. And the analogy that we used in the very beginning was that a pilot and copilot, where human beings are often good at creating hypotheses and especially given that we operate in an industry that is about essentially predicting and influencing human behavior but there is always an opportunity for human beings to create the emotional and make it an emotional appeal. But after you do that, there, of course, is a role for machines to play. And following the data and learning, revising those hypotheses and iterating, testing blue creative versus the red creative. And of course, blue and red in terms of the different types of creative have evolved into all different types of generative AI, where creatives can do a whole bunch of different things. There\\'s so much opportunity for AI to play a significant role. You may also recall that when we launched a new product in 2018 that we call it Koa and it was our AI solution that helped advertisers to optimize campaigns on our platform. We -- in fact, they use the analogy of copilot which, of course, Microsoft is using today as their analogy to help engineers write code which incidentally, I think, is one of the most interesting ways that people are actually monetizing AI. Almost all the discussion about generative AI is on things that I think are going to have difficulty in actually monetizing. The copilot of Microsoft, I think, is an opportunity to actually monetize and I think it will help our team write code faster. But there is a couple of things that I just want to highlight but I do not believe are happening in a public discussion adequately today. The first is there\\'s this mindset of winner take all and that there\\'s Google versus Microsoft way of looking at things and I just don\\'t think that\\'s the right paradigm. I think we should look at AI like very expensive code. It is expensive to write and it is very expensive to process. It takes more compute power. And because the reason it\\'s more expensive to write is partly because of how complicated it is and the implications, especially of generative AI. So because it\\'s very expensive to both write and to execute, it is an opportunity for bigger companies or at least those that are profitable to do very well. And the fact that we have been operating so profitably for so long puts us in an amazing position. Additionally, there is this topic of the quality of our data sets. And I just want to remind everybody that the Internet has been struggling for a very long time with the concept of truth. Think back to like social networks in the last election cycle and how much discussion was spent on fake news and all these topics that really center around truth. Now that you\\'re able to crawl so much of the Internet to generate essentially artificially intelligence-driven opinions. It is very difficult to figure out what is true. It\\'s even harder than before and I wouldn\\'t say that the Internet did a phenomenal job before. So now of where we\\'re all sitting is we\\'re looking at the datasets that we rely on and say how good are they because the AI will never be better than the quality of our data sets and that is the reason why I think we are in a phenomenal position because so much of the data that we\\'re looking at is, number one, something that we get directly from the data source itself. So we\\'re listening to every ad request on the open Internet. And from that, we have essentially a pure dataset that we can reach conclusions on. We\\'re not scraping user-generated content. We\\'re not scraping the comments section of every website on the Internet, where there\\'s just tons of falsehoods and inaccuracies. We are looking at what people actually read, what they actually listen to, what they actually are interested in and we\\'re able to create conclusions and pair them with UID and have massive datasets that we then can use to make more informed decisions. That creates opportunity for us to play a huge role in the future of AI in advertising. And just to rattle off a few ways that, that can have -- can play a role in our business. We can have an AI assistant for traders and essentially create a better ability to talk to the data. We can automate the building of ad groups and campaigns to find the audiences to make recommendations. We can do a better job of creating not just internal information-seeking, where you write a search query. Although we can, of course, make it easier to query but we can also do a more personal job of summarizing that. And maybe the thing that I\\'m most excited about is a creative generation, where we can create more variety but also we can make it really easy to create, add especially for video and CTV, for medium and even smaller businesses that I think can lower the barrier to entry for us to move from not just the biggest advertisers in the world but to many, many others, where the friction can be reduced. Those are just a couple of ways that I think AI is going to play a substantial role. I\\'d just remind everybody that Thomas that I quoted from the CEO of Coca-Cola in the prepared remarks. I think that captures very well and just another opinion that I have on the topic. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we\\'re thinking about this so much, why we have been investing really from the very beginning, why we launched Koa in 2018 and why we continue to iterate on it. Thanks so much for the question.\\nOperator: Next, we have Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Jeff, I\\'ll ask one. How are you thinking about the benefits to advertisers from using Trade Desk offering for connected TV PMP or kind of like the upfront product versus what the SSPs are pitching? Is there kind of PMP but they\\'re their kind of direct product? And then kind of what the downside risk would be to the publisher from either solution?\\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So there is this opportunity for buyers to look across all reach and frequency and all the different places that they buy and summarize that all in one place and that is one of the benefits that the Trade Desk brings to the table, is that people tend to come to us and say, \"I need to have a holistic view.\" And because CTV in particular, is fragmented, as I\\'ve said before, perfectly, meaning that it\\'s not too small that there\\'s millions of websites, we have dozens of outlets but it\\'s not too aggregated so that we only have one place to buy which is not that dissimilar from what search is, where you buy from one place or what much of social is. So by having it fragmented, that makes it so needing somebody to look across, everything becomes very important. Now in the cases where you\\'re buying programmatic guarantees or you\\'re buying at a fixed rate and you\\'re not controlling frequency across all these different things, then you lose a lot of the benefits of programmatic. And in fact, you lose decisioning. So what is sometimes happening is people are buying at a fixed rate. They\\'re going to the seller and saying, \"Hey, in the short term, I don\\'t need to control reach and frequency. I don\\'t even care about decisioning. I\\'ll let you, the seller, decide which impressions I get. I just need to move this over from broadcast or traditional television into the digital ecosystem.\" And in that, given that you\\'ve sort of weakened the value proposition of programmatic, it is a bit of a jump haul. You could do that with an SSP or a DSP because you\\'ve gotten rid of all the benefits or the best benefits of programmatic. So that\\'s where others are stepping up and saying, \"If you want to, you can temporarily use us to buy directly.\" But even if you listen or read closely in, for instance, what Comac [ph] announced in the last couple of days, authorize the same, while people are just moving dollars over, we want to help them move them over. But we do believe that in the medium and long term, this will be very good for DSPs. And what they\\'re acknowledging is that as soon as somebody wants to be holistic about the buy and they want to compare this buy to something else, that they have to use a DSP in order to do that. And so because we\\'re so convinced that the very best of programmatic and really what\\'s in the best interest of buyers is for them to participate in decisioning, not to give that away to the sell side but for them to participate in decisioning. And while sometimes that means they have to pay a little bit more, including to us, that decisioning and what we bring to the table is always worth it. And so it\\'s because of that belief that I believe that the SSPs are highlighting that in the medium and long term, the buyers are going to gravitate to the places where they have decisioning. But in the short term, when people are just trying to move over from essentially an insertion order and not control any amount of decisioning and just do so with sort of dumb pipes, that can be done with us over somebody else. Advantage to do it with somebody else, it is they might be able to save a point or 2. Advantage is doing it with us is they\\'ll have a more holistic view. But we think both medium and long term, they\\'re going to end up going to a place where they can decision holistically. And we think that means they end up with us, especially in the world of CTV.\\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\\nTim Nollen: I\\'ve got a CTV-related question as well. I was listening to the Disney call just before your call started here. And Bob Iger said some very interesting things related to CTV and programmatic, I mean, including saying that they\\'ve added 1,000 new advertisers using programmatic. 1/3 of them are -- 1/3 of advertisers are trying programmatic. They\\'re talking about their pricing tiers, seeing the value of programmatic ads in driving advertising revenue for them for their ad-supported tier and so on. My question then is, given the Forward market event that you had a month or 2 ago and the talk -- the conversations you\\'ve had, Jeff, with both sides, maybe if you could just give us a bit of insight into how you\\'re working with -- is it Disney? Or if you don\\'t want to talk about Disney, specifically other network groups as to how to get them to offer more of their ad inventory inhabitable format, not just doing the insertion orders and if this is something that you\\'re participating in actively in the upfront market which is due to start next week.\\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. I really appreciate the question and I heard some of those remarks before I jumped over, of course, to focusing on ours and we\\'re very excited by the remarks that Bob made. Let me first just say I\\'m so proud of our partnership with Disney and what we\\'ve done there. I\\'m also excited about the fact that both Paramount and MBC announced their adoption of UID2 in Q1. So as it relates to all the major content owners in the United States, everyone now has spoken publicly about their adoption of UID2. And I think all of this, whether Bob\\'s comments or the adoption of UID2, is a commentary on the state of streaming competition. So -- and actually, the numbers with Disney are also a commentary on that. They\\'re trying to grow but also be profitable and there\\'s a lot of pressure on the current environment and on cost. So what that means is that people need to do more with less. And especially the content owners, they need higher CPMs so that they can fund all the content and make the same money that they\\'ve been making as people continue to make more and more content and the market gets more competitive. The only way to do that is to make the ads more relevant and more effective for the advertisers. The only way to do that is to leverage same-site UID and transparency and biddable marketplaces so that we can participate and get that increased value. What we\\'re most excited about is all of these are moving more towards biddable. So in light of what we just said in the last question when we were talking about how -- when people don\\'t want decisioning, then they can use dumb pipes to execute that. That\\'s not in anyone\\'s best interest long term because advertisers need efficacy, the publishers need higher CPMs. The only way that, that works is in a highly-decision, highly data-driven biddable marketplace. And that means that everybody is moving into a biddable environment. When we look at all the things that we talked about in our Forward \\'23 event as well as we look at what\\'s happening going into the upfront and honestly, the fact that the upfronts are -- sort of have this cloud over their heads of the writers’ strike, I actually think helps us and connected TV because that amount of uncertainty makes it so that people are more likely to say, \"You know what, I\\'ll just buy it in the spot market.\" And the spot market is programmatic. And that\\'s great for everybody, to be honest, because it means a biddable data-driven ecosystem. But what the themes that we keep hearing is that, they want the ability to activate their data. I mean advertisers want the ability to excite their data. We\\'re seeing them buy on value more and more and not on price and that often means that they\\'re willing to pay a premium for decisioning. In fact, in our Forward event in from Hershey\\'s, I think articulated this about as well as anybody can. And in this economic environment, we\\'re seeing more and more people gravitate towards flexibility and having the ability to adjust. And when you add that cloud of the writers’ strike, you also add just economic uncertainty. And then you, of course, add in biddable, you have the ability to bring data to the equation, that makes it so that everybody is looking more and more to programmatic as its future. And I think when Bob Iger underlines that, I think it becomes easier for everybody to believe that in the marketplace. So I was excited by his comments. I appreciate your question.\\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Cost [ph] with Morgan Stanley.\\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chloe [ph] on for Matt. Just as we think about OpEx leverage throughout the year, are there any areas that you would call out in the second quarter and going forward, where you\\'re looking potentially to gain a little bit of leverage in the model? And then second, on the key investment priorities, it sounds like you have so many exciting products and so many moving parts between CTV, the retail media opportunity, UID2, OpenPath, like there\\'s a lot to unpack there that you\\'re focused on. But what do you think is going to contribute most significantly to growth this year? What are you prioritizing? And then what\\'s a little bit more of a longer-term project?\\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So on the OpEx, I\\'m going to ask Laura and take the first part of it and then I\\'ll add a little color on that and then I\\'ll also talk about the investment opportunities or feel free to chime in on both.\\nLaura Schenkein: Absolutely. Thank you, Chloe, for the question. When we look at the big picture for Q2 and the rest of 2023, we\\'re excited. We have a great luxury. We\\'re high growth. We\\'ve got profitability and we\\'ve got cash flow. I\\'m proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments over the past few years as it\\'s really paid off. Unlike many of our ad-funded peers and other high-growth tech companies, we\\'ve responsibly managed our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. And since our revenue is still growing well in the double digits while others are contracting or in the low single digits, we intend to and can stay the course and grab share even while our peers are pulling back. So we do expect for 2023 that our operating expenses will increase year-over-year both with and without stock-based compensation and we continue to be extremely deliberate in our investments and our hiring. So our headcount will grow this year but roughly half the rate as it did last year which sets us up nicely for the rest of the year and for 2024. And on the second part of the question, we still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV, data and retail media. So as we\\'ve seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops through to the bottom line. We saw that in Q1. And we are comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about growth this year and say that, especially as we think about significant tailwinds in 2023, that set The Trade Desk apart from other companies and that can help offset anything we see in the macro environment. And by that, I\\'m talking about a strong GBP pipeline which bodes very well for future growth. CTV as a channel continues to grow incredibly fast. And in the big picture, we still have a relatively small amount of share and lots of room to grow. And then as we\\'ve been talking about retail media, we\\'re really just scratching the surface of a $100 billion plus incremental TAM opportunity and all of that makes us extremely excited. Jeff, I don\\'t know if there\\'s anything you would add.\\nJeffrey Green: That was amazing. Very impressive, Laura. Thank you. I don\\'t have anything to add on the OpEx. On the investment side, I\\'ll just add, let me first just say I am so excited about the moment that we\\'re in right now in the ecosystem as well as just all the macro conditions that sort of frame this moment for us. And I recognize that there\\'s lots of uncertainty and managing that day to day isn\\'t always fun. But overall, it just creates this amazing opportunity for us and I just want to explain why. So first, we have an opportunity to continue to invest in our people and to grow our culture. So during the pandemic, managing our team and preserving our culture was really hard. Everybody was remote and things like that. It\\'s just -- it was very difficult, in part because of the decisions that Blake and I made to make certain that we didn\\'t invest too aggressively. We were -- we never had to do a layoff. We never had to hit the brakes too hard. And now we\\'re in a moment where we get to continue to hire and he\\'s really set things up well for me and Laura to continue on that path. We are hiring today. And unlike 1.5 years ago, where we were competing with every other company seemingly in the world, especially in Silicon Valley, now we\\'re hiring from those companies and we\\'re not competing with them at all. And so we\\'re able to very carefully choose people because we were one of the first to come back to the office. We were -- we have a culture that\\'s really well intact and we\\'re hiring into that and that allows us to grow. And when you\\'re trying to hire engineers, especially when there\\'s this opportunity to invest like in AI, this environment and this backdrop and our history makes it an amazing time and place to invest in people. As you know, just from knowing our financials at all, like that is our biggest investment, is in our people and it is also our greatest asset no matter what the numbers say. Also I\\'ll just say, of course, we\\'re going to continue to invest in CTV. This is the biggest secular tailwind we may ever see in this company\\'s history. I didn\\'t know that another one would come along when we ran into shopper marketing. Of course, there\\'s an opportunity for us to invest in the forward market which really has a lot to do with CTV. Of course, we\\'re going to keep investing in UID2 and that is going to continue to pay dividends for as far as we can see into the future. And of course, when you have a strong balance sheet like ours, you get to invest in things like AI but you also get to investment in things like a stock repurchase which we started to execute on but there\\'s more opportunity for us to do going forward; so -- just so many places for us to continue to invest. Those are some of the highlights. I\\'m sure I left off a dozen or more.\\nChris Toth: John, you can close out the call.\\nOperator: Thank you.

       "  Document(page_content='Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Trade Desk’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today from our Singapore office are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I am thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it’s been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth and it’s always inspiring to spend time here, more on that later, but first, on to our results. As you have seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled gardens in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment. Our vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found as we have predicted CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet, when possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren’t comparable to others. In short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever, because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side roadmap and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street. Because of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JBPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JBPs position the Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JBPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media, whether it’s decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising. With this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing. WPP’s GroupM predictive worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022 and we are growing at more than 3x that rate. CTV continues to be a key growth driver and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it’s only our third full quarter total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3. As we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk and more of the world’s leading retailers are also now following suit. The chorus of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet, while CTV maybe the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second. Political also continues to perform well. Mid-term election – over mid-term election, we have exponentially grown our business. We are proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides. With all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I’d like to touch on three areas. First is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet even in a volatile macro environment; second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value; and last is the critical mass of support that is growing around Unified ID 2.0. And why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet. So first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens. You only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world’s largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, “it is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend. That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.” Back in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hint of uncertainty. But what you are hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world everyday now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world’s most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform. We provide objective transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance and we provide access to the world’s most advanced data marketplace including many of the world’s biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals. We recently ran a campaign for Clarence, one of the world’s largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the UK. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multi-channel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement. As a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest. For years now, we have been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I will make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I have said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets like the UK and France are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category. Let me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C-class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets. ViewSonic is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets such as India, the Philippines, Germany and UK. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign. Back in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year, with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets. Our success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV. Not enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators who have long histories in advertising and what they are doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers’ experience. Peacock is one of our longest standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I am thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance. UID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let’s remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There is nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns. One of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo and the results they have seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad-spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform. The adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have. One of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world’s leading data aggregators such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world’s leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without it ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year, will be UID2 tag. With more and more of our publishers’ inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year. With this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year, because we have done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision, and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond. I’d like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I have spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices such as Melbourne and New Delhi as we have benefited from new JBPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here. As I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That’s true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand. Many inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile, and of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia-Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead. To come back to where I started in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don’t often comment on competitor performance, I do think it’s worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we are gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform. I could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we have discussed today and we will continue to innovate to lead the market and I am confident that the world’s leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail. As our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double-digits, while many companies in the ad funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We have also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers and we are building trust with our clients for the long-term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We are seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI. Q3 was another example of our ability to grow top line while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I’m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long-term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I’m fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions. From a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we’re encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend. Despite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget. Every ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we’re starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company’s unbiased partnership with them and that we don’t own inventory, we don’t compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021. While uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Hi, guys. Nice job on execution. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you expand and talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing with the macro? And then separately, just how you see the setup as we go into next year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, could you just talk a little bit more about the 4Q guide and just some of your assumptions there? Thank you, guys.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the question. So let me first start with the macro and talk about this year. So I don’t know that I have ever been more proud of our performance than what we just put up in Q3. And that’s in large part because of the relative outperformance where most other stocks are either negative or reporting single-digit growth. We put up 31% and we’re doing that in an environment that is a little bit more uncertain. If there was an advertising mix, it would be at an all-time high and it’s hard to say whether that’s because of macro headwinds or mostly macro uncertainty, but it would be high because of one of those themes in each case. But because we’re definitely in an environment regardless of where that’s coming from, where advertisers have to do more with less, it means more that we’re winning share in this environment. And I definitely believe that we’re grabbing land. So I take a lot of comfort in what Procter & Gamble said in their earnings report, which is that we are actively shifting our spend from linear and non-targeting TV into programmatic and digital that is a lot more precise. And so when you look at just the overall macro environment, I just think we’re just doing so incredibly well on a relative basis, that it’s hard not to be proud, it’s hard not to look at what we’ve done and see grabbing land. But when you turn our attention to 2023, and you start to look at all the new inventory that’s going to come into CTV, whether that’s from Disney+ or digital inventory from Peacock or HBO or Netflix or Paramount Plus or Fox or ESPN or Hulu or the fact that we reported in earnings that this year 11 markets outside the United States outperformed in the United States in premium video or connected television. And then you look at the UID tailwinds that we have, we just surpassed 600 partners in UID and that we’re activating data at an unprecedented level. We are going to go from a minority of our – or I’m sorry, of our data on our platform being enabled by UID to the majority of our third-party data being enabled by the beginning of next year. So we’ll finish that work this year going from minority to majority. I do believe that in 2023, we will have the best data marketplace that the ecosystem has ever had. I think we will have the best first-party data onboarding that we’ve ever had. And that’s not even talking about OpenPath, which we didn’t really have time to talk about in our prepared remarks, which will be direct integrations with hundreds of the world’s largest content owners and that will accelerate our growth and land grabbing around the world irrespective of the macro environment in 2023. And of course, last but not least, with us partnering with over 80% of the largest retailers in the United States and of course, partnering with many all over the world, all of those trends point to an incredible opportunity for us in 2023, that wouldn’t be possible without the grabbing of land that we’re doing right now. So with that, I’ll pass it over to Blake to just talk a little bit more about the second part of your question.\\nBlake Grayson: Hey, thanks, Shyam, for the question. So your question on Q4, just to start off on Q3, again, fundamentally great quarter, actually pretty steady, too, which was great to see 31% revenue growth off a relatively hard comp last year of 39%. And political has ramped up for us as well. So like you’ve already seen standout performance versus peers who are growing at much smaller or negative rates, again, CTV led the way, still opportunity there. Shopper marketing is ramping up well for us, too. The Solimar adoption is exciting. We’ve got the momentum on UID as well. And so just grabbing share from company zone, and you’ve heard us talk about these JBPs as well. That’s also been ramping and has been strong. And so as you think about, as when we think about going into Q4 in our setup, again, relative to the rest of the industry in Q4, we’re growing significantly faster, which, in my mind, just confirms we’re grabbing share. Advertisers are be more deliberate. I just personally believe we’re in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID. As a Chief Financial Officer or CFO, I definitely appreciate the uncertainty that so many of my peers are facing right now, right? Like the best CFOs are actively working to rationalize the investments that they are making and they are prioritizing the ones that have proven measurable returns. And in that environment, The Trade Desk we gained share because companies are now prioritizing programmatic as the first place to invest that first dollar. So while you can obviously dial programmatic up and down quickly, it’s doing really well for us. And to me, that just shows the power and the value of this model. Now specifically with regards to Q4 a couple of thoughts, not only is our Q4 sequential growth well into the double digits as many app funded companies are flat or negative. We’re actually forecasting accelerating growth on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And I recognize that there’s a political impact in there. But when I just step back a bit and look at a year-over-year acceleration in Q4 in this environment, to me, that’s a standout performance for us and it gives us a lot of optimism about our future and the momentum that we’ve got. And I hope that helps.\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First, maybe, Blake, can you talk about the – how you look at the expense structure for 2023, maybe talk about the puts and takes, growth versus the need to invest more? Do you expect margins to improve relative to where you are for – or will you end up in 2022? And Jeff, maybe going back to connected TV, very impressive kind of both numbers and color commentary. Can you maybe speak to the competitive positioning that you guys have relative to other CTV players? And do you believe that you are actually gaining share or losing share relative to other players that arguably are also benefiting from growth in CTV next year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Blake, first I’ll take the second and Tim, if you don’t mind, adding color after I deal on CTV.\\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Hi, Youssef, thanks for the question. So with regards to thinking about expense structure in 2023 and such I really just like stepping back a bit to remind everyone that the business model in the situation we’re in highly desirable, right? We’ve got a situation where we’re driving high top line growth. We’ve got high adjusted EBITDA growth with strong margins. And we’ve got not only strong free cash flow generation, but consistent free cash flow generation. So having all of those working together, which they are, it gives us an opportunity and ability to be deliberate with the choices that we make. I’m just also super proud of our ability to stay disciplined with our investments regardless of the operating environment. I – there’s a lot of companies out there that might have more resources than us that are pausing or even cutting their resources because they potentially invested too aggressively. And we didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. I think maybe like some of these companies did, and that’s paid off for us. We have the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and that includes hiring. As we think about 2023 specifically, should we see any significant changes in the situation, we definitely have levers available to make changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 during COVID, we can adapt. But still, the expense structure of the company today is better than it was pre-pandemic. But overall though, and I’ve said this on a number of calls, we’re always looking for ways to invest and drive growth that we think pays off for the long run. For 2023 specifically, I would say a couple of things. We do expect return-to-office expenses like travel and live events to return to pre COVID levels. And the other thing to keep in mind is I would expect seasonality of our expenses next year to be a bit more like 2016 to 2019 than they were in 2020, 2021. And just for example, we have our large company event that will finally move back to its regular timing in Q1, it was held in Q2 of this year. That’s just a great opportunity to bring our team together, especially after what’s gone on in the past few years, whether we’re solidifying our culture, framing our strategy versus the opportunity we’ve got. And also just highlighting, again, the discipline perspective we take as a company about driving profitable growth. So looking into 2023, I think we’re in a great position to drive more scale and efficiency and free cash flow. And we have so many opportunity areas to focus on. I’m really excited about that. And then...\\nJeff Green: I’ll start on CTV and then Tim if you want to speak to it as well. So I really think there’s two parts to talk about on the CTV question. The first is just talk about the category a little bit and then also to just talk about why we win specifically inside the category. So of course, right now, at The Trade Desk, we’re living a secular tailwind that I don’t know that we’ve ever seen before, and I don’t know that we’ll ever see again and that is going to continue into 2023, largely because of the amount of inventory that is coming online. But also as you look across the open Internet, and whether that’s inside of display or native or audio or any other channel because CTV is leading the way in forging the future of identity, CTV is not just leading in our business and not just the most interesting thing happening in programmatic, but it’s the most interesting thing happening in ad-funded media. And so as a result, CTV is the first – is quickly becoming the place where people spend their very first dollar and was not surprised at all to see our partner, Disney+ report 12 million new subscribers. And of course, Netflix added a couple of million themselves on just the promise of an ad-funded option coming soon. So there’s more inventory coming online, programmatic we’ll just continue to drive CTV. And I do believe that very soon, CTV will be the most data-driven channel. And that to me is one of the things to really just focus on in terms of why we’re winning inside of CTV. So why are we winning above everyone else. So in order to be competitive, you do have to be omni-channel. So you can’t just be focused on CTV because you take the data and the learnings from all other channels and then apply those to CTV where CTV is a top of the funnel activity where you’re typically creating awareness. And then all the other channels are follow-ups, if you will, to that really effective moving picture and sound that happens inside of CTV. And so in order to be most effective, you have to be holistic. So you have to be omnichannel, but you also have to be global and then very importantly, you have to be objective, which means you can’t compete with any of the content owners, which is one of the themes that is really a problem for most of the walled gardens, especially Google, which is that, of course, they have their own media in YouTube. And so content creators are not eager to part with somebody – or to partner with somebody that they compete with in their very – in the core of their business. So by being objective and not competing with them by being global, by being omni-channel and then there’s something that we say all the time to every content owner on the Internet, and that is that you have to have an authentication strategy and you have to have an identity strategy. And we’re able to go to the content owners and partner with them on both of those things. And you see this with Disney. Disney is doing extremely well. We’ve been very vocal. They have been very vocal about our partnership on UID. It is a part of their authentication and identity strategy. That is what makes personalized ads possible. That’s what makes high CPM as possible. That’s what makes low ad loads possible. So we become a really critical partner for them while not competing with them because we’re objective. You put all that together, and that’s the reason we’re winning. But I’m sure Tim, you can say more about this.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Youssef, thanks for the question. And as I look out next year and kind of why I think we’re differentiated and in a position to win, it’s a little bit of what Jeff said. So you’ve got a lot more inventory coming online. So as Jeff pointed out, we’ve got Disney+ and Netflix, they get a lot of the word count in the ecosystem right now. But let’s not forget, HBO Max, Paramount NBCU, Fox, the rest of Disney, Hulu, ESPN, ABC, etcetera are continuing to lean into programmatic. And the reason that they lean into us is if you think about it from their perspective, and they look back at the ecosystem of people who do what we do, a lot of those companies are competing with them. So they lean in heavily with us and they partner with us in a number of different ways, including on identity. So UID2, through our partnership with Disney, I think, is going to be a major catalyst for the CTV category. As a result, that inventory is going to have much richer decisioning going into next year across the entire category. So when I think about 2023, there’s this like perfect collision of addressability and scale in the premium content space that we’ve never seen before. And I think that’s going to be a huge benefit to The Trade Desk because it’s mostly to date in this CTV story. And I think in 2023, it’s going to be a programmatic CTV story. And so I’m really excited for that in 2023 because I think all of these things combining that addressability and that scale is going to create an environment for CTV to be the most data-driven channel in programmatic next year. And I am really excited for that. And as a result, I think CTV is going to very quickly become the first dollar spent in digital media, and I think The Trade Desk is well positioned going into next year.\\nYoussef Squali: Super helpful.\\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Laura Martin with Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey, Jeff, just following up on your comments about ID on connected television, the MAD data shows that 80% of viewing on connected television is shared does seem to undermine some of the targeting benefits that we had on individual devices like smartphones and tablets. That’s my first question. And then my second is China. You’re sitting in Singapore and you’re noticeably silent on China. So could you give us an update on what’s going on with China and your business these days? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Fantastic. Thanks, Laura. Really appreciate the question. So when it comes to shared viewing or the impact that, that has on CPMs or does it pose a threat to the ecosystem or is it a problem for CTV, let me just first sort of answer that emphatically, by saying it’s not a problem for the ecosystem whether you frame it is CTV worth it. The answer is yes. Does it have a frequency capping problem, the answer is no. The bottom line is when we are considering, targeting or customizing ads, there is an individual graph, there is a household graph. Both of those are considered when we are making the placement of ads and shared viewing doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s worth any less. And in fact, what we are competing with is an environment in linear or broadcast television that is almost always shared viewing, but it’s not measurable. So, finally, we have the ability to measure when it’s being shared and when it’s not. And of course, a lot of premium video is on personalized devices. And I have been reminded about it again and again this week as I am here in Asia and reminded how much premium video is consumed on mobile devices. So, household and individual graphs are both considered, but when you compare the sort of spray and pray a broadcast or traditional television, into the efficacy, the targeting, the identity-driven lower ad load with content that is more premium, you put all of that together, the impact on digital is exponentially more valuable than a linear broadcast and the efficacy has gone up way more than the cost. And as that phenomenon continues to unfold in 2023 that Tim was just describing really well, which is that it’s becoming a programmatic story where there is more inventory, and we can select more and more from the sort of wider selection of ads, the personalization, the customization, the efficacy is only going to continue to go up. So, it’s absolutely worth the shared viewing. I don’t even view as an issue. I don’t spend time thinking about it. So, as it relates to China, China is of course, one of the largest markets in the world, and we are constantly keeping our eye on the fact that while as a media market, it’s about half the size of the United States. It is growing at twice the pace. As you recall, last year, China was our fastest-growing office in the world. This year, that hasn’t been true, but that’s largely just because of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. So, we have been quiet, in large part because of those geopolitical issues and because there has been some slowdown. If the geopolitical issues weren’t enough, there is also COVID lockdown that has affected them in a very significant way. But we have been quarter-over-quarter, up over 100% in this environment. Shanghai is no longer our smallest office, which it was just 18 months ago. And we just – we continue to believe that while the English-speaking world has led much of CTV, the Chinese-speaking world is the second most important as it relates to the premium video play and that we continue to look at China and all the Chinese-speaking nations of the world as a very important battleground for the future of global television and premium video, so still excited and bullish just a bunch of things that make a fair amount of uncertainty. Thanks, Laura. Appreciate the question.\\nChris Toth: Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Two, if I can. Jeff, as you exit the year and have these data initiatives and OpenPath kicking in the year, how should we think about the competitive landscape and how that looks in 2023 versus what we have observed in the past? If I look at some recent commentary by Proctor & Gamble, it seems like there is a lot more programmatic budget and relationships up for grabs heading into next year. And then for Blake, I appreciate your color on the Q4 guide. Could you please put a finer point on some of the trends you observed quarter-to-date? And how we should think about growth over the rest of the quarter? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I think you are right in that. There is more and more budget that’s going into programmatic. I think the commentary that we have heard from Procter & Gamble is indicative of that. As you have heard us say before, the supply chains of the open Internet, but really the supply chains of the entire ad-funded Internet have become a little bit murky and as often happens when markets mature, become just much more complicated. So, it becomes more and more important for us to be obsessing about supply chains or supply pads. I have said before that I think one way to characterize the success of Amazon, it is that they have had an executive team that has just obsessed about the supply chain and just making certain that they are getting things as efficiently as possible so that they can deliver to their consumers the best product as fast as possible for the best possible price. We have applied that same sort of obsession to the media supply chain, which in some ways is even more complicated. And we have said, as often as possible, we want to make certain that no one in the middle is taking more in fees or tax than they are adding in value. And we do believe that, that happens a fair amount of time because of complication and because of sort of draconian tactics of some of the biggest tech players in the world. Our way of combating that is to release products like OpenPath, where we plug in directly with the biggest publishers in the world. We have had a number of conversations with content creators, whether that’s in CTV or in mobile apps or in traditional web development, where they have said they don’t feel like anyone is representing them the way they would like to and they would like to do their own yield management and plug in with us directly. That creates a more efficient supply chain, while us maintaining our role on the buy side as well as our objectivity. So, when you couple that with all the data initiatives going into 2023, and I have said in the prepared remarks that I believe because of Unified ID data, especially first-party data will be 10x more valuable in 2023 than it’s ever been historically. And that’s largely just because of the math of UID and the scale of UID and not having to sync like we did in cookies, not only is the Internet getting an upgrade because we are going from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet, but we are also getting rid of some of the clunkiness that cookies had, which makes a data-driven Internet just so much more effective. And of course, it’s better for consumers when it’s opt-in. You put all that together, we have a more effective supply chain. While budgets are up for grabs, we think that we are more likely to get the first dollar than anyone else. And what has happened over the most of the history of The Trade Desk is that we got the leftovers from search and social and the walled gardens. And what’s starting to happen now is we are getting the very first dollar, and that’s happening more and more. We expect that to continue as a secular tailwind that CTV continues. So, I appreciate the question.\\nBlake Grayson: And then, Justin, just on your question on the Q4 trend, one way maybe to think about it is, it’s a little bit of a tale of two cities like and you have heard us say this before, like or a cave shape recovery, if you will, for certain verticals. Some areas like travel and auto are outperforming and they are making up for lost time. Some areas are more challenged. You have heard us talk about Europe, but as we have said that before. But specific to Europe, as we have said, we have seen incredible CTV growth there, which is amazing in light of the macro challenges. So, it makes me super optimistic for the future for us there. And then the automotive growth, especially it’s been especially exciting to see some gains there. We have won new business and then some more existing from existing customers after a period of volatility over the past 2-or-so years. And so I think that – and then even if you talk about CPG companies, you got some that are doing incredibly well and then some that still have some supply chain challenges as well. So, I think that the breadth of the advertisers and the verticals that we represent bodes super well for us and like there is still areas of opportunity for us to gain share there, too.\\nJustin Patterson: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Justin.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Tom White at D.A. Davidson.\\nTom White: Great. Thanks. Given the elections here yesterday, I thought I would ask a question on political. Jeff, any big takeaways around political ad spend this cycle? Any learnings that we should kind of take away that you are taking away as to the future of political ad spend on CTV and I guess, just digital broadly? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, one thing that’s happened in the past is that we have seen them sort of focus on social and other parts of political. But what we have definitely seen this time is that CTV is the preferred channel for political advertisers, and it’s playing a larger role in every election cycle. One thing that is just really important for me to note is that as there has been more and more mistrust of specific tech platforms in the political environment, we are really proud of the work that we have done to focus on providing a better democratic process for both sides of the aisle and making certain that our platform is objective and independent so that we can power both Democrats and Republicans and anybody else for that matter. And I think our team has done a phenomenal job over really the last decade in winning trust and providing reassurance to both sides that we are going to provide them with an objective platform that’s going to make it possible for them to do the very best and sort of let the process do its thing. It’s our job to run a better process not to advocate for specific candidates or to get in the middle politics more specifically. And as a result of creating that arm’s length relationship, we once again believe we have run a better process and been a key contributor to running a healthy election. We expect that to grow in 2024 as we move into the next presidential cycle. But once again, CTV plays a very significant role, and we think it will play a bigger role in every election going forward. And we are really excited to see the election or election growth and expect that to continue into the future. So, I appreciate the question.\\nTom White: Thanks.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Tom.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, I want to know if you could talk about your decisioning intensity in CTV maybe versus other channels, particularly in the context of private marketplace deals and things of that ilk. Do you do as much heavy lifting there versus other channels? And do you get pushed back on pricing and any differences in the intensity there and also in CPMs?\\nJeff Green: Yes. I appreciate the question, Brian. So, we have been asked some form of this question over time in various ways. And it’s essentially to say do we add less value in CTV, or should we be charging less? So, it’s – are just two different ways of asking that question. And I would argue that we add more value in CTV than we do in any other channel. And also the value that we are adding is going up over time. So, the first part of that is the reason why we are adding more value is because the stakes are higher. If you in the stock market, if you buy stocks at random or you buy them all in ETFs, they tend to go up over time. But if you buy ads at random, you will get your kicked every single time that you have to select very carefully. And in the world of CTV, when you are buying very highly expensive or high-cost impressions, the stakes are higher. You have to make certain that you use data to buy the right ones, you have to get reach and frequency right. And I would argue the only platform in the world that manages reach and frequency well on CTV is The Trade Desk. So, we add more value. And as time goes on, when you add more impressions, there is more opportunity to outperform and select more carefully. So, while there have been a series of PMPs or ways of buying and limited decisioning methodologies, those have gone down over time. And those are typically training wheels are on ramps for advertisers that over time are replaced with just high decisioning. And that’s where all of our biggest advertisers are heading. That’s where our product has done. And we think over time that we just continue to add more value for essentially the same cost as we do in everything else, but our take rate having remained the same, pretty much our entire existence as a publicly traded company. So, I think it’s something that has been important for us to clarify. And so I really appreciate the question, Brian.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks Jeff.\\nChris Toth: Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, just a UID follow-up, we have heard concerns that publishers are being slow to adopt UID. What can you do to speed up adoption? And how are you thinking about this? Do you agree? Do you disagree? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I am constantly reminded that if you sat me down a year ago and said Jeff, write up a dream list of adopters. I don’t think I could have fictionalized or made up a list that’s more impressive than those that we have actually added AWS, Salesforce, Snowflake, Adobe, you heard us saying a year ago that we needed to add the infrastructure of the Internet. And those and hundreds of others represent that infrastructure with now approaching 600 partners. And that doesn’t even underscore the entire infrastructure of the data ecosystem of the Internet, names like Experian or InfoSum or so many others. So, with all of those coming online and then you add the CTV players companies like Disney, who have adopted it, and it will be just really critical next year that all CTV players are leveraging UID in order to get the personalization and the high CPMs that they all desperately need to compete. When you put all that together, I actually don’t have any idea where that assertion is coming from that publishers are going slow. The only way that I could possibly make sense of that, just that some of them, it takes a little bit of time to prioritize and actually implement. But in terms of commitment or signing or prioritizing, it’s there across the board. And we have so much momentum on the issue that I honestly, a year ago wouldn’t have thought it’s possible for us to have the momentum that we have now. And I believe it’s just critical for companies, especially content owners to be leveraging that in order to do well. And you will see us in 2023 push really hard to enable advertisers to bring their first-party data to bear. And I do think that, that will represent a very strong rebuttal to the value propositions of walled gardens and the leverage of first-party data and their ecosystems. Because here, they will get to put their first-party data to work and then measure relative performance, learn from it, take the learnings with them so that they can continue to improve their marketing and not just outsource advertising and marketing to walled gardens, which has historically been the only option that they have had. So, UID plays a really critical role in the future of the open Internet, and it’s doing its job.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Let’s take one more question Holly.\\nOperator: Your final question for today is coming from Michael Morris at Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning guys. I have two topics I would like to ask about. One about the joint business plan momentum and one about Asia. So, on the first topic of the JBPs, I would love to hear how – if there is some way you could quantify or help us understand how much more valuable a partnership through a JBP is compared to sort of your run rate business or somebody, a partner who is not involved in one of those, how much value does it add? And also how penetrated is the market at this point for those? How much more runway do you feel you have with respect to the kind of addressable market for partners that are of this size that it makes sense for. So, that’s the first topic. And then the second just on Asia. Jeff, you did spend a lot of time talking about the opportunity there. The Asia-Pac market historically has been a pretty tough market for Western companies as they compete with local players. So, I would love to hear a little bit about why you think you can be successful where maybe some companies in the past have not? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thank you. I am going to have Tim take the first part of the question on the JBPs, then I will add some color and talk about Asia.\\nTim Sims: Yes. Michael, thanks for the question on the JBPs. I will kind of try to cover everything that you mentioned there. So, first, starting with what’s the difference between a JBP and a typical engagement. One of the major differences in the JBP is that these tend to be multiyear agreements between The Trade Desk and a brand or agency. And they tend to set kind of a partnership framework that often includes milestones for that partnership over that multiyear agreement, which is typically a longer period of time than a standard MSA that we would sign with a client. So, within that framework, typically the way that these work is that the advertiser, we sit down and we set goals for ourselves around things like how do we move more spend into the platform, how do we think about adjusting their investment mix moving it towards more data-driven advertising, how do we think about using platform features that they may be underutilizing. It’s a really great framework to structure how we build a stronger partnership with that brand or agency over a longer period of time. And one of the incredible benefits of that is it creates a lot of stickiness and engagement with our partners over that period of time because we are constantly checking in on achievement against those milestones. And I think the way that we look at those as just these longer term engagements is it really creates a lot of a deeper conversation with our partners so that we can really figure out how we are structuring these that are going to see the best interest of their business and how we can kind of jointly agree on what we are going to try to achieve together over a multiyear period. So, in the end, all that leads to a much more interesting and dynamic conversation and discussion over time. And we are really excited about the momentum that we have right now, and we are expecting to continue to build on that into the future with more JBPs with more clients.\\nJeff Green: Thanks Tim. Well, said, I don’t have anything to add on the JBPs. I am excited to weigh in on Asia, though, because I really appreciate your question. And of course, we are also all sitting here in Singapore and nearing our 10-year anniversary of being here in the Asia market where we started here in Singapore. So, we have a team in our company that we are not an American company, we are a global company that happens to be based in the United States. And can we be successful in Asia, my response is we already are. 11 markets in CTV or premium video grew faster than the United States for us. So, when I say 11 markets, I am not – I am not talking about it in general. I am talking about The Trade Desk markets. Our spend grew faster in 11 markets for premium video outside the United States than it did inside the United States, the fastest region for growth around the world, Southeast Asia. It grew faster than Australia grew faster than North Asia, grew faster than Europe. It grew faster or South America. And that’s in large part because we are – just like in every other market, creating alternatives, especially UGC, where YouTube has a very dominant position in many of the markets here. But also you are seeing from the content creators that historically, they have had sort of a regional benefit where there is licensing that has prevented U.S. companies from competing with them in their markets. But one of the reasons why you have seen Australia a close rival to leading in terms of size or percentage of market moving to CTV with the U.S., those two leading the way is because with English language content that no longer having regional barriers, but English content is competing all over the world. And the same thing is happening with Chinese content and all others. So, what you are seeing is that the content owners are no longer viewing their next door neighbor in sort of broadcast as their biggest competitors, but instead looking at companies like Disney and Netflix is their biggest competitors around the world. So, they are all looking at the ad-funded options that those companies are creating around the world and saying that we quickly have to follow in order to compete. And so as a result, we are getting partnerships all over the world. We are setting up partnerships. That is the reason our executive team is here in Asia is because it’s not lost on us, but most of the GDP growth for the next 10 years is going to come out of Asia. And that in order for us to capture our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM, we have to be competitive in Asia as well as in other regions of the world. We are already doing that. And we have been doing that in this market despite things like the strong dollar and economic headwinds and some geopolitical issues, but we continue to do that because of strong partnership and a global mindset. And of course, we represent most of the largest brand in the world. And whether you are talking about Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola or McDonald’s, these brands advertise all over the world, and it’s not lost on them that GDP growth is going to come out of Asia. It’s not lost on them that the fastest-growing middle class in the world is here in Asia. So, you put all of that together, it’s a market that we are already winning in and we will continue to do so. We have over invested. If you look at our employee count versus our revenue, of course, we are early, not late. And that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Michael. And Holly, you can close up the call.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today’s conference call.

       "  Document(page_content='Operator: Greetings. Welcome to The Trade Desk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are both Founder and CEO, Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses and Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results could vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company’s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. Spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record. CTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. Our results are often benchmarked against the Rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company’s growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth. In times of market uncertainty, perhaps it’s most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by Dentsu, total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I’d like to focus on why we are winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future. Specifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we have reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth. I don’t think we have ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we’re gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they will prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens. With that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year, a more than two-thirds of the market according to Group M. What’s driving these two trends? Well, as I have said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. I’d like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions, because I think it will give you a sense of why I am so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I’d like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever and it’s because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I’d like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023. So, let’s start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is? A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those two consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google. Our goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incents more competition and improves privacy standards and that’s exactly what we are starting to see. If you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don’t think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solve the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy. To be clear, I am talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2. This is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we have ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser’s first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies, simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before. They can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value. At CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way. Of course, it’s not just on the data side that we are seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet, because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world’s leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we have talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio. Just a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn’t agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important and CTV will continue to lead the charge here, because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem. There is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad-supported lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there is pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way. Advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their targeted audience than without UID2. That’s astonishing progress. And it’s just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world. The CTV is the kingpin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open Internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It’s not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it’s fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rationale enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers, and of course, media companies. Because of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that every theme in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we will see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that’s the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years, but the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy. To adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today’s digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust to buy the CPMs required to power today’s content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data. We will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we’re hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what’s interesting about this event is that I don’t think there is any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising. It will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it’s not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, a global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as Vidio, WeTV and iflix. For this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they have been achieving against user-generated content and the click-through rate was 15x higher. In addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren’t possible a few years ago. The recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media. I’d like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there is a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy. As I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States and we are growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don’t exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens. Once again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023? From an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won’t be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the themes I am preparing for as the CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift. Retail Media Networks will continue to grow in influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic. First, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won’t be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value. Second, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel, because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market. As we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet. I will close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I’ve met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023 and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast growing channels like CTV, they are finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale. CMOs also understand that while the current macro environment maybe uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath. And the world’s leading media companies are integrating with us so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model. Everyone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven, decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet. Right now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and Retail Media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail. Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It’s a comprehensive look at how Google operates including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that’s because our mission has always been to provide an open objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens. We focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It’s the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another. I could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we’ve talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don’t like to comment on competitors’ performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment. We continue to sign JVPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways. And I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world. Q4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to share and significantly outpaces our peers on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the 9th year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides to our customers has increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy. Deliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business level. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy. Our shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It’s worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q4. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes. Unlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA. Income tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. And finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances. Turning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1. Turning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment. We’re also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. We are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs to the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022. In closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We’re executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we’re amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we’re adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Thank you. Hey, guys. Congrats on the continued strong performance. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about just what you’re seeing and how you’re thinking about the macro this year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, can you provide a bit more color on the 1Q guide and anything in terms of linearity, that’s worth noting? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: First of all, Shyam, thanks. I appreciate the question and the kind words. So first, let me just say that we’re incredibly proud of our performance in 2022 and the start to 2023, of course, especially on a relative basis. So far, of course, relative to all other scale ad platforms and companies, public or private, we feel like our relative outperformance is greater than it’s ever been during 2022 as well as so far in 2023. From a macro standpoint, in early January, we – it’s a little bit of a late start due to the calendar year. We also saw the way that both brands and agencies were planning was a little bit delayed. But then we’ve seen things start to unlock. And we saw instead of there being delayed – instead of there being canceled, there was just delays and then those have become unpaused and unlocked since then. As a result, we’ve seen more JVPs and we’ve seen a lot more activity so far in 2023 than we’ve seen at any time to this point in any year previously. So overall, we’re very encouraged by the trend in 2023 so far, extremely optimistic, especially as we continue to grab land relative to all of our competitors.\\nBlake Grayson: And Shyam, this is Blake. I’ll try to answer your other – your second question. Just to go back a bit on Q4 real quick. Fundamentally, a great quarter despite the macro uncertainty out there. I’m really happy with the 24% year-over-year growth. It’s a standout versus our peers, many of which seem to have shrunk in Q4. CTV again leads the way for us. We’re grabbing land now. It lays the foundation for us when times are better. In the prepared remarks, you heard me say data adoption is really encouraging as it spins our customers’ flywheels. With regards to the linearity question, just to lay a little bit more like what Jeff talked about, a bit larger deceleration in December than normal from what we saw in October and November. But we’ve accelerated off that pretty consistently so far here in Q1, which is really nice to see. So I’m cautiously optimistic for the quarter. Some places are more challenged because of that uncertainty. But we see strong growth, especially in CTV and relative to the rest of the industry, we’re growing significantly faster than I think so many of our peers who are signaling declining or negative growth, and we’re growing in into the double digits, which, to me, just confirms that we’re taking share. And so even though there is uncertainty out there, I think we could be in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID as advertisers are prioritizing programmatic spend more. The only other thing I’d maybe add about the Q1 guide, just want to comp perspective is if you exclude the political election spend that we had in Q4 ‘22 that low single-digit percent share of spend, our quarter-over-quarter seasonality is trending just slightly better than we’ve seen on average. So I feel really good about Q1 so far, and I’m optimistic about the quarter.\\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam, Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matt Swanson at RBC Capital Markets.\\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. I’ll add my congratulations on the execution as well. Jeff, I want to ask you on all the Google developments we’ve seen in the quarter. I think a lot of us have read your thought pieces on the subject, which have been really insightful. But could you elaborate a little bit on what you think the near and long-term impact on the market is of the antitrust? And I think especially the comment you made about the market will become more fair one way or another. And then if I could add a quick follow-up. There was a beta launch of the Privacy Sandbox for Android last night. Does this change any thoughts around maybe the potential cookie deprecation time line or how likely this is to happen?\\nJeff Green: Thanks a lot, Matt, for the kind words as well as the question. So let me first just talk about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. So let me just give the sort of punchline first, which is that I believe we will win regardless of the outcome. So no matter what happens, I think we’re going to win. We have been winning in an unfair market. So – of course, if the market becomes more fair, which we think it will, as a result of this, like I said, one way or another. Then of course, that signifies significantly better environment for us to perform it. The Department of Justice has clearly done their homework on this, which I am extremely encouraged by. I know there is some at Google who tried to suggest that we have been through this three or four times before. I do believe that this is fundamentally different. And part of that is just because of how detailed I think the case is outlined. I do believe there are many possible outcomes here. There is lots of people that are talking about breaking it up. There is lots of other potential outcomes. But I do believe that in any case, this will slow down Google, there is a 100% chance of that. And so with them slowed down, with the market moving towards just better competition and more fairness, I believe there is no way that this isn’t good for us. I do want to acknowledge that as there is some pressure to just break up assets, I don’t believe that, that alone is enough. And that if that’s all this done, I think technology could be replaced and some of the same practices that got us here could happen again. So to me, the most important thing that happens here is that any settlement or any conclusion to the case ends with more fairness and restrictions to make certain that the market stays fair, especially when leveraging assets that are extremely nearing monopoly, if you will. So as it relates to Privacy Sandbox, there has been a lot that have been discussed about Privacy Sandbox in the past. It’s often, I think, wrongly compared to the world of cookies and doesn’t necessarily acknowledge the importance of relevance in order to create a free and open Internet that can subsidize the content that currently exist on the open Internet. So I don’t actually think that, that has much to do with the antitrust case or the deprecation of cookies or UID2, but certainly something to launch.\\nChris Toth: Thank you, Matt. Next question, Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, guys. And congrats again on the really strong execution, all things considered. So I have two questions, one for Jeff and one for Blake. Jeff, can you maybe just share with us, based on the commentary you’ve made about walled gardens, etcetera, what signals are you looking for as an indication that if walled gardens will begin to take down their barriers, what will that look like for you guys? And then, Blake, can you maybe talk about your OpEx or just your margin expectations? Your Q1 margin implies basically you’re back to pre-COVID levels. You have to go back to like ‘18, ‘19 to get down to those low 20s margins. Is that kind of the right way of thinking about the cadence throughout the year? And then do you expect margin improvement this year relative to last year? Thank you.\\nJeff Green: I’ll have Blake first, and then I’ll follow on with the question about walled gardens.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. So let me just step back a second and then I’ll try to get to all the details of the questions that you asked. Just want to remind everyone about the power of this business model. I’m a huge fan of it. High top line, growth generates solid adjusted EBITDA with strong margins generate consistent free cash flow generation. I’m really proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments for the past few years really paid off for us. Unlike many companies, either in the ad funded space or in the technology space, we’ve been pretty responsible managing our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. We didn’t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. So there is – while many companies are pulling back or making some very tough decisions about the resourcing, we’re able to say the core grab share, combine that with actually growing into the double digit contracting. I think it sets us up really well. As we think about our operating expenses next year, it will increase year-over-year. That’s a combination of a couple of things. It’s a combination of the 2022 hiring flow-through that we’ve had. It’s also a combination of return-to-office expenses, including travel and live events. But again, we’re going to be deliberate about our investments in hiring and you heard on the prepared remarks, we’re going to grow our headcount in 2023. But as of right now, we’re thinking roughly at half the rate of 2022. We still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV and shopper marketing and be ready to capture those. The other thing I would say about Q1 is also just the seasonality of live events, there were live events that occurred in Q2 of 2022, and those will happen in Q1 of 2023. So the seasonality is important to pay a little bit of attention to. But overall, the way I would just say it is we’re comfortable with where things stand. I’m cautiously optimistic about our growth at the start of the year. Should we see a significant change? We have levers available to us to make those changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 with regards to the COVID. And I believe the operating expense structure of the company is actually is better than prior to the pandemic when you deal with that kind of seasonality issue that I was talking about. We’re in a great position to drive more long-term scale and efficiency as well as free cash flow. So I feel pretty good about that. Now Jeff?\\nJeff Green: To the first part of the question as it relates to walled gardens. So first, let me just remind everybody what walled garden is and I’ll give you just one of the definitions, which is that this is a destination that is essentially a must-have on a media plan. So that the owner of that destination, whether it’s a social network or a video platform or any other walled garden, the owner of that can afford to be draconian and set their own rules. And what’s happening in part because of CTV because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV is perfectly fragmented. And what it does is it makes it so that there are enough players that no one can afford to be draconian. And no one has enough market share to do that. But it’s also concentrated enough that you have very large sophisticated players that are making decisions, and so they are all hypercompetitive and actually hyperrational. So what I think that does is it puts a lot of pressure on walled gardens because of the fact that there is this alternative that are super competitive and super efficient. When you add to that, the CTV is driven by nearly 100% authentication. It lends itself to just highly personalized content in a way that no other channel has to deal with, whether we are talking about in the mobile environment where IDs are under pressure, in part because of Google and Apple or in the browsing web for the same reason, we are – in CTV, we have authentication nearly all the time. Additionally, because of those UIDs, we also have the opportunity for retail to do exceptionally well and all of that puts pressure on walled gardens in the open Internet now poses as a very viable alternative. So, whether we are talking about CTV, whether we are talking about retail, whether we are talking about the economic environment and pressure that, that puts on walled gardens to want to welcome incremental demand. All of that points towards an ecosystem, where more and more of them are considering bringing down the walls even the largest of them so that they can welcome incremental demand. And certainly, an environment like this is where you are most likely to see some of those changes. So, there is lots of activity considering that sort of stuff. And I do believe you will see announcements in 2023 suggesting more and more walls coming down. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Youssef. Next question Holly.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Vasily Karasyov at Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: Good morning. Jeff, can you please talk in more detail about the forward always on Connected TV event you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then connected to that, can you talk more about the – your forward market product that you mentioned today? And also, I think you spoke about it a couple of quarters ago. That seems like a very interesting product. And of course, fighting the upfront market is a pretty gargantuan task that you are undertaking here.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So, Vasily first, I really appreciate the question. You are right. The upfront market is huge. But I see that as an opportunity, one, because it of course, adds to the TAM, but also because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the upfront market hasn’t changed since 1962, much. And really it’s a shame that it hasn’t changed because the way the upfronts work today is that you can’t really bring data to the table. And so CTV is in a very interesting position right now, which is that it has been getting a premium largely because their scarcity. So, consumers have moved into CTV, into on-demand, over the Internet content. But as they have moved, the number of ads available for advertisers to put in front of those consumers hasn’t gone up nearly as quickly as consumers have moved over. So, that’s created a scarcity premium for all the ads. But we are seeing more and more inventory come online. And so some of the biggest content owners in the world are having to find ways to make the efficacy justify those prices instead of scarcity. And that’s part of the reason we talked about that the amazing case study with Disney, where they talked about 12x more effective as a result of using UID2 than alternative means of personalization that what is absolutely required to bridge that gap between what was coming from scarcity and now being provided via efficacy. And so of course, CTV is getting more effective. But if you don’t bring that same level of data to the upfronts, then you are going to miss out on almost half of television. So, what we have designed is an always-on forward market, which is essentially just a new version of the upfronts. But in this case, we are using technology to make it so that you can bring data to the table. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis. And when I say always on, the upfront is done once a year. You think about commodities and equities markets, those markets are on all the time. It doesn’t really make sense to only do it one week a year. And there is an opportunity for advertisers and content owners to constantly be evaluating the value of entering a commitment so that you can either get a discount or be assured that you are going to sell all of your inventory. I believe that’s going to be an important role in TV, the same – or in CTV, the same way that it was in traditional television. But we need a product that brings data to the table. Otherwise, it cannot justify the high CPMs that everyone has become accustomed to in CTV. And of course, advertisers aren’t going to pay high CPMs that the efficacy isn’t there. There is no way to bring all the best parts of digital to the table, leveraging the upfronts the way that they have existed to-date. So, we are very excited about it. We don’t think that we have to compete with anything other than a 1962 product. And because of our super low, I think we are in a really phenomenal position.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Vasily. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, can you talk about the opportunity to go direct to publishers with OpenPath and just broadly the benefits to the publisher, the advertiser and then Trade Desk as you think about measurement, targeting and economics, so kind of this broad question on basically the pitch to everybody about OpenPath? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So thanks. I really appreciate the question because I don’t know that most understand what OpenPath is. And so I appreciate the opportunity to just clarify. And so from the very beginning of the company, we have been pretty obsessed with improving the supply chain. And as I mentioned in other forums, I often look at the biggest technology companies in the world and try to study them for what they have done successfully. And I find a lot of inspiration from Amazon in this, which is just, I think as a company, one way to define their success is just they obsess over supply chains, how do we make it more effective for the end consumer. And that’s exactly the same thing that we have been doing, both with the ad tech ecosystem. There are a lot of steps between advertiser and publisher that are unnecessary at times and are in some cases, unfair or that people are taking more in fees than they are adding in value. And ultimately, that is to the detriment of us and the advertisers and agencies that we represent. Often also on the sell side and in the exchanges, there can be an auction that is unfair. I mean to some extent, that is exactly what the Department of Justice is filing suit against Google for an unfair auction dynamic. So, what we have been trying to do is to create a supply chain that is fair and transparent and competitive. We found in our discussions with publishers and content owners that often they are as frustrated as we are with the supply chain, and say, why can’t we just integrate directly. So, we made it very clear to the market, especially to SSPs that we are not interested in competing with SSPs. We are not interested in doing the yield management for publishers. But when a publisher wants to do their own yield management, we are happy to integrate with them directly so that together, we can ensure that the auction is fair and that the pipes are clean. And as a result, we also think that not only will we clean up the supply chain and make certain the fees aren’t extracted where they shouldn’t be, but we will also have greater transparency, and that will actually create better CPMs because efficacy will go up. So, this is especially important when we are talking about connected television in part because so many of the content owners have purchased SSPs, and so most of them own it. So, they have already made the decision to get in the business of yield management. So, we are extremely excited to be integrating with some of the largest. We have talked a lot about our partnership with Disney, and that’s in part because Disney, I think represents the largest amount of CTV ads anywhere on the Internet currently, meaning owned by one company. And with their commitment to both UID2, but as well as to integrating with us directly, we think that that sets the tone and the pattern from what will happen to everyone else. Of course, we have announced our partnerships on UID2 with CBS and Paramount Plus, and Disney and some of the others, but that lays groundwork for us and then continue to do the same on OpenPath. There is a long to publishers, not just in CTV, but in other channels that have also signed up with OpenPath. And we think that represents the start of a much cleaner supply chain in the open Internet. Thanks for the question.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Next question please.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, we saw a recent piece from the Head of Media, Bush, talking about her preferences for PMP deals within CTV versus programmatic guaranteed. She said because it helps me manage reach and freak across CTV destinations better, i.e. decisioning. But what trends are you seeing there? Are marketers shifting from programmatic guaranteed and saying we need reach and frequency control? And what’s the marketer kind of makes that step down the decisioning path, do they tend to use more of what you offer in terms of expressiveness and personalization and getting into kind of open auction environments?\\nJeff Green: First of all, thanks for the question. Second off, super impressed with how well you understand the business. That’s just implicit in the question is just a deep understanding of what’s going on in the space. You are spot on. The premise of your question is spot on, which is that inside of programmatic guarantee, you don’t have the same amount of decisioning as an advertiser. And so it means that you are often giving up your choices in terms of what you buy, and you are getting up your ability to control reach and frequency and just other things, which to me, doesn’t make a lot of sense. In equities markets, you wouldn’t necessarily just hand over all decisioning. If you are a portfolio manager, you want to make your own decisions. So, you want to decide what you are going to buy. And that’s exactly the people that we are appealing to. Those are the people you are talking about that are in highs [ph]. There are people who want to make decisions about what they are buying and selling and especially because if you are going to pay a premium, you want to make certain that you are controlling reach and frequency. And in fact, the math just doesn’t work, if you are not controlling reach and frequency, then the premium that you are paying to PMC TV is no longer justifiable. And so the math is putting decel towards using and leveraging more decisioning, but also just people wanting to be more effective, that’s the way that they had the most amount of control. And we are seeing more and more of the move towards PMCs and just anything that is fully decisioned. So, PMCs are going to present the most common way that that happens in CTVs and whether those PMCs are initiated by us or others really doesn’t matter. What is most important is that the advertisers themselves and/or their agency representing them, have a full decision in where they decide to put the ads. And when they have that, that’s where CTV is at its best. That’s where digital is at its best.\\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Brian. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mark Zgutowicz at The Benchmark Group.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Good morning guys. Jeff, just curious how much of your 4Q revenue you would attribute to UID2? And what do you expect that number to look like in – for the year? And then how many of the large pub UIDs that you are talking about are activated in your auction? And then separately, curious what you expect Apple will do with private related this year and what Google will do with its ID over the next, call it, 24 months and how that may impact ROEs on your data graph? Thanks.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, the first part of the question is pretty hard to answer in terms of how much of it came from UID2. And that’s in part because, of course, we use UID2 that then leverages the graph. And in that graph, it’s still of cookies and lots of other identifiers that we lean on for now and in some cases, won’t be there in the future. But we of course, could deduce the same thing with just slightly lower statistical confidence and still have lots of room to provide personalization across the Internet. So, we don’t really know how it’s impacting it until it’s not there. But UID2 continues to grow at a rapid pace. And it often is the connected tissue between all of those other things. And then when you couple the fact that in Q4, only about 15% of our data – our third-party data had UIDs associated with it, and we expect that to be over 70% in the first half of this year. There will be dramatic upticks in what’s happening with UID2, and it gets rid of much of the matching problem, but we did see large upticks in the use of data in the second half of the year, largely because of UID2. So, it’s hard to quantify, but in terms of the total revenue impact. But in terms of impressions and data that are leveraging that, it’s just substantial. It’s a substantial part of our business today. So, this is a huge driver for our business now. And every day that those buy is becoming more and more of the case. I am sorry, these are being leveraged more and more as time goes on. And in fact, our OpenPath initiatives as well as our initiatives to just get closer to publishers and SSPs in 2023, the IDs and global placement IDs are being adopted around the Internet. As it relates to Google’s ID, there is a bunch of different Google IDs. Of course, there is a single sign on. Of course, there is the Android ID, which there is a lot of discussions about in the future. And then of course, there is cookies. All of those are largely in the control of Google. One thing I think Google has done well on most of these is they have given announcements and said we are going to do this years from now. And some of those dates are end of 2024. So, we are talking about 2 years from now. I think it’s reasonable to expect that part of the reason why Google is putting timelines out like that. And so that they can see what happens with things like the Department of Justice litigation, they want to see how the dust settles. And they are kind of between a rock and a hard place as it relates to protecting privacy, but also guarding against antitrust pressure. So, I actually don’t think it’s in Google’s best interest to make those all go away. What I love about and some of the things that they have said publicly on this specific issue is that they have to consider the impact on the Internet – really on the open Internet and all the publishers that they support and especially with the amount of scrutiny that they have right now on the antitrust side. I am not sure that it’s ever in their interest to see those go away from the open Internet. But I think another way to look at it is that we are just hoping that things like UID2 to go really, really well and it takes some pressure off of them. So, it sort of goes back to the one way or another, things are going to get better. And I think with the pressure that Google is facing right now, I think that’s more true than ever.\\nChris Toth: Thanks Mark. Next question.\\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Laura Martin at Needham.\\nLaura Martin: Hey there. Jeff, tactically on the DoJ, so it’s 150 pages of how Google has been abusing their clients. My question is, have all the smart clients that could leave Google already come to The Trade Desk, or do you feel that in 2023, you are going to be getting incoming calls now that their clients have read this 150 page really draconian treatment of clients. So, do you benefit from that in the near-term? And then secondly, UGC, so I agree with you on the walled gardens. You have been writing that a long time that walled gardens are losing share to the open Internet. UGC, it’s the first time I have heard you talk about that. And I guess I hadn’t thought about it because I was thinking TikTok was taking share from the two big guys, meaning YouTube and Meta. Could you go more into why you think UGC is losing share to the premium because I don’t really understand that one?\\nJeff Green: Sure. So, on the first part of the question related to the Department of Justice and their litigation against Google and will that benefit The Trade Desk and our clients coming to us as a result, I definitely think that, that will continue. As you know, we have great relationships with most of the largest advertisers in the world. So, I wouldn’t say that there are not many that are extremely large that would move over that hadn’t already done something with us. But there are some that are changing the politicians, if you will. So, meaning they are doing less with Google and doing more with us. So, I do think that there is an opportunity for that to be positive for us, but pretty early to tell. As it relates to the UGC side, so – and why I think there is a change happening with UGC and more moving to premium. Let me just explain a little bit what I think is happening with the economics. And a lot of this comes back to UID2. So, because of the pressures that are being put on identity across the Internet, there is even more premium that is heading towards connected television because it’s nearly 100% authenticated. So, because of that 100% authentication that does enable personalization that is not likely to be changed or controlled by any one company. There is enough fragmentation whether you are looking across operating systems, or whether you are looking across content owners. And of course, you have to log-in with an e-mail address almost every time to watch content. So, that enables a level of personalization and pushes people towards the open Internet. While at the same time, UGC is having more supply than ever. And with less personalization and less control coming from advertisers, there is just a more stark contrast between what’s available in CTV and what’s available in UGC. Said another way, there is finally a viable, scaled alternative to massive UGC platforms that now make it. So, it’s not quite – it doesn’t give the same luxury to be draconian in those UGC platforms as you could be elsewhere.\\nLaura Martin: Thank you.\\nChris Toth: Thanks. And Holly, we have time for one more question.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Salmon at New Street Research.\\nDan Salmon: Hey. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me. The take rate stayed in that consistent 20% range once again, ticked down a couple – a little bit in the last couple of years, picked back up again. You have talked about the balance of large and small clients driving that in the past. Is there anything different going on there? And I would be interested to hear just a little bit more about how your JBPs, or joint business plans, compare on a take rate business and if that’s an important variable as well? Thanks guys.\\nBlake Grayson: Maybe I will take a stab, Jeff, if you want to follow-on.\\nJeff Green: Okay.\\nBlake Grayson: So right, 2022 marked I think, the ninth of the year, where we have had really consistent take rate trends. If you look at our take rate data from 2014 to 2022 over that 8-year period, I think we went up 4 years and we went down 4 years. So, it’s really been very consistently right around that 20% figure. Some years, it goes up a little bit, some years it goes down a little bit. But the real important thing to note about the take rate is that while it’s been really steady, and I said this I think on the – in the prepared remarks. We have made massive improvements for our platform, right. We are shipping new products. We are adding new features. We are innovating for customers. And we are effectively passing that surplus to them so they can create value and then grow spend with us and then spin our flywheel. And I don’t think there is any reason why that historical range changes for the near future. And we continue to expect that we will make further improvements to the platform and the data marketplace. And the focus is always about grabbing share and thinking about margin dollars, not just margin percentage. And with respect on the JBP side, there are just a lot of facets that go into that. It’s not just like a rate conversation we don’t have. So, we are incentivizing data usage. We are incentivizing the omnichannel benefit that we have as a company. And so it’s really not any type of a drag because you look at our JBP as a percentage of our spend and it’s been growing pretty nicely. And we went through a little bit of that in our Investor Day presentation in late last year.\\nJeff Green: I guess the only thing that I will add is, I just want to underline a couple of really important points here. First, our take rate has gone up 3 years of the last 6 years, and it’s gone down 3 years last 6 years, stayed pretty much the same the entire time for a publicly traded company. Important to note that during that time, of course we really shipped a lot of software. And what I have always been focused on, and we talked about this during the IPO roadshow. We wanted to make certain that we were adding to consumer surplus. I mean by consumer surplus, we mean our users so that we are giving them more and yet the price is essentially staying the same. I think we have done that over time, and that’s partly why our client retention rate has been so high and the satisfaction of our clients has been so high. We expect to continue to add to that consumer surplus that we want to make certain that our clients want to say. We believe that, that is the definition of economic sustainability to provide more value than you extract and we have been doing that over time. There is always a desire to try to figure out what are all the drivers of the take rate and what makes it go up and down. There is a lot of complex things, whether it’s about channel mix, whether it’s about geographical mix, whether it’s about size of clients, there is a whole bunch of things, also the use of data. But I think the single biggest contributor in 2022 to any change in take rate was largely just the way the data marketplace changed. And I expect changes in 2023 to continue to affect that. But we are always going to be looking for ways to keep that take rate essentially the same and increase the consumer surplus so that we spend the flywheel because at the end of the day, we are trying to grab land.\\nDan Salmon: Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you guys.\\nChris Toth: Holly, we can close the call.\\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

       "  Document(page_content=\"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\\nChris Toth : Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.  In particular, our expectations around the impact of the recent pandemic on our business and results of operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions or other macro events that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to our risk factors referenced in our press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\\nJeff Green : Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future. Our performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment. We now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives such as Connected TV, Shopper Data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us. As a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Group's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic in part because of the combination of our exceptional 95% plus retention rate and our significant growth rate. There are macroeconomic forces, which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also gives me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show out. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV. In fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lot of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient. So first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean we've used cookies as a make-shift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique community to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. The open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers. With this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers. UID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each Web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress. In terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it. Let me give you one quick example, which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like the Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a comScore top 5 lifestyle media platform with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.  MediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now. Momentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages, simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will [crater]. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2 with many already reporting strong CPM growth. The ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2. AppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet. We also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for Web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium. In the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today. In order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt. The CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still an opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability while significantly upgrading consumer privacy. And new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content.  Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments like CTV we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy. So in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement, partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants. There is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I'd like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it. Already, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair-step increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future. Related to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I'd like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies. I do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return. For example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters, the Washington Post, Gannett, Conde Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others, McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hearst Magazines and Newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle, the Tribune Group and several others. In the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including the L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet. As more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers. For those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment. Let me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers. On a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDB TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by Discovery Plus leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic. A tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted in mass to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them. For consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera.  In the past, nearly all channels have had ads. Now once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely set up a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further. It's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression. In all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day. HBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs. For CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience. CTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models like upfronts and even programmatic guarantees where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets. As advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers. With the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video in all of its forms has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content. We work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it. And we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply. Not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets. Premium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV. And so you'd think they'd be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content. It's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. An advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies. The Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data. As the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward. As I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers. Our profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details.\\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 started out strong with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. Solimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster. We are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up. With the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend, and audio represented about 5% of spend. Geographically, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1. We did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and food and drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1, and free cash flow was $136 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. I am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business with significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment. I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Shyam Patil from SIG.\\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the results. I had a couple of questions. First one, Jeff, when we look at your results and your outlook, they look a lot better than what we’ve seen from a lot of other ad-funded companies during earnings. Can you just talk about what you think is driving your outperformance? And then second question, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rest of the year shaping up?\\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Shyam. Appreciate it. So I – as I look at the outperformance for this quarter, and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter, it’s hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I don’t know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course, we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. It’s just a very exciting phenomenon. But I’m also just very encouraged by the fact that, of course, there’s macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course, the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment, what we’ve historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where they’re going to spend money, and they become very data-driven in the choices that they’re making. And in our case, that means they’re spending more with us. So I’m just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're –we’ve seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year, which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising, especially from the global players of CTV, I think it really sets up the second half of the year for – around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think we’re seeing even more of now. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year, we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP who’s just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Target’s media company, Roundel. So to have Walgreens, Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement, just unbelievable. But just again, nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then, of course, in the second half of the year, we’re also going to have a midterm election. From recent events, that seems to be one that’s going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think it’s – we’re very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So we’ll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words, we’ll move everything over to Solimar, the platform that we shipped on July 7, 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for, but now we’re extremely confident that we’ll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath, but we didn’t mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed, L.A. Times, Forbes, MediaVine, Red Ventures, which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others, have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second – or to the remainder of the year, say, second half, but to the remainder of the year.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities.\\nYoussef Squali: Two, if I can. Jeff, 3 to 4 years ago, you were already on the strong opinion or the strong belief that Netflix has to offer an ad-supported model. That was just a matter of time. How do you feel about your chances of potentially partnering with Netflix around that opportunity and – or the potential risk of Netflix potentially building its own DSP, Amazon? And Blake, Q2 EBITDA implies a pretty big sequential and year-on-year drop, I think, to that 33%. Can you maybe just flesh out the biggest areas of investments and whether there is a typical kind of conservative built into that or – and just how should we think about that for the remainder of the year?\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. Great. So you’re right, I’ve been saying for more than half a decade that I believe that Netflix will eventually have to show ads. And that’s really based on the fact that I believe that consumers want choice. And that while Netflix has done a phenomenal job of preserving an amazing experience for consumers that at some point, that becomes cost prohibitive because you have to just keep raising prices, that is exactly what’s happened over the years. And they’re now at a place where I believe they will benefit from offering that choice. I think they have more pressure on them. Because of that history, I believe they have more pressure on them to create an amazing ad experience than anybody in the streaming competition, if you will. It’s partly because of that, that – you may know, David Wells, who was the previous CFO of Netflix joined our Board almost 5 years ago. So we’ve had a great relationship with Netflix because of him, and I’m extremely optimistic in the potential for us to partner with Netflix. One thing that you should know – and Youssef, you – I think you put just words to something I’ve heard from a few other people as well is why wouldn’t Netflix build this themselves? So what most advertisers are trying to do, they are trying to manage what we call reach and frequency. Like how often do I show the same ad to the same consumer across apps and channels? And so if I just control how many times I show an ad on station 112 and then just control how they can they show an ad separately on station 114, and those 2 things don’t talk to each other at all, you can waste a lot of money and show a lot of repetitive apps. This is why in traditional television, there’s a lot of repetition. It’s also why the ad break has so many ad in that. If Netflix were to provide an ad experience that have lots of repetition, in order for them to make the money that they need, they would have to show lots of them because the CPMs will be lower because they’re less effective, which creates more repetition, and you get into that unfortunate cycle that I believe has happened in traditional television. The sure is way out of that is for them to partner with an objective independent DSP that manages reach and frequency and budgeting across all the fragmented pieces of streaming so that we can provide the very best ad experience for everybody because we’ll be paying the highest prices, because of the fact that it’s so much more efficient or effective. So I’m very optimistic that we’ll be able to create partnership with every major streaming company in the world, including Netflix. The fact that we have a phenomenal relationship with Discovery, and therefore, also Time Warner and HBO, we have great relationship with them. We have a fantastic relationship with Disney. We partnered for years with Peacock and with Paramount and so many others. Of course, I had the expectation that we’ll do the same thing with Netflix.\\nBlake Grayson: And Youssef, to follow up on your question on the EBITDA for Q2. Just to frame it up, I’m really happy with our situation and where we are. Like we mentioned on last quarter’s call, we do expect in 2022 to increase the pace of our investment as we focus on the long-term growth of our business. And that’s got a support from a very strong business model that produces strong free cash flow and has a really, really solid balance sheet. Our Q2 forecast reflects that. It includes accelerating hiring across the business, particularly in engineering, business development and account management roles that really play a huge factor in driving our long-term growth. We also expect our in-office expenses to start ramping this year to prepandemic levels. And we also anticipate hosting more employee events to get the team together. But in terms of this year, Q1 EBITDA was very strong. I’m comfortable with our EBITDA trajectory and where things stand over the remainder of the year. And like we said last quarter, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic. And as I’ve always said, this business is really built for and I’m really optimistic about driving meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow as we scale. So I think that lots of great opportunities in front of us, and I feel pretty good about it.\\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Swanson from RBC Capital.\\nMatt Swanson: I’ll add my congratulations on the quarter. Jeff, maybe staying on the theme of CTV and Netflix. You mentioned still having an abundance or maybe an overabundance of demand for CTV. Well, with the upfront is coming up, could you maybe give us an updated view on the supply-demand curve, especially for premium CTV content? And how you think about the addition of Netflix and Disney+ with all that content coming online and whether or not we’ll see lower CPMs? And then I guess as was kind of a follow-up. Jeff, you mentioned that obviously, you saw Netflix coming from a long term – a long time away. When we think about the maturity curve now, though, for any subscription model hitting that threshold of payers, do you think this is going to change how new products launch from here on out when they see a Disney and Netflix and HBO Max all leading ads? Is – are we going to see any subscription-only products still get launched?\\nJeff Green: First of all, I appreciate the congratulations. We’re extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction, most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first, let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And it’s in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and you’re paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result, when you’re adding new inventory, it’s desperately needed. There’s demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what I’anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that they’re, of course, in order to continue subscribers, which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers, which is the way they’re all graded, they have to have a great ad experience. They can’t alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance, and they have to provide very few ads. So that means we’re going to see scarcity for a while, for as far as we can see in the future, honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious – as obvious to everyone, so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that we’re just SVOD, I don’t think it’s strategically smart for anybody who’s just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. It’s like any product where over time as it evolves, if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesn’t have features that rivals the iPhone 13, and instead, it rivals the features of iPhone 1, you’re just not going to be competitive. You’ve got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that, that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\\nVasily Karasyov: I have a couple, if I may. One on Europe. You said in the prepared remarks that spend did slow down around the start of the war in Ukraine, but then recovered in April. So can you tell us your thought maybe in more detail about what the advertising environment is in Europe right now and where it’s going in your view? The second question is about political. You did make some comments on it, but wanted to see if you could give us more detail. So broadcasting companies have been reporting, and they’re saying that they see a record political cycle spending so far. So can you tell us, please, how you feel you are positioned? And do you think this could be some incremental revenue growth this year from political?\\nJeff Green: Yes. Sounds great. I’m going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them, and then I’ll also take time with both of them. So Blake?\\nA –Blake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So with regards to Europe, just first to put into context, historically, our growth has been driven by the very strong position we have in the U.S. Europe represents a single-digit share of our spend. CTV has been the primary driver behind our growth in the U.S., but European CTV also gaining share. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about that more than doubled – they grew in the triple digits in Q1. We did see more of that gap – of a gap between North America and international in the second half, but it did – it recovered a bit in April and recovered back to what we were seeing in January. But there is still some room to improve. I think that, that’s not a surprise, I think, for people who follow the space. The thing I think about when I think about opportunities like that is when customers become more deliberate with spend and they focus on the most efficient investment opportunities, that’s when The Trade Desk tends to shine because from my perspective, we proved it out in the second half of 2020 when we saw that as people needed to be more deliberate, they were focusing on the areas of investment that have the highest ROI, then they were consulting with us, and it worked out actually quite well in our favor. So I’m super optimistic about that. With regards to political, yes, it’s a great opportunity for us, and we’ll see how this ramps up because it’s going to probably start ramping up for us over the summer into November, obviously. You’ve seen reports that talk about midterm election spend on par or better than the 2020 presidential elections. The one thing I would encourage you to think about as you go through the forecasting is that seasonality is going to be different than we saw in 2020, so you’ll need to take that into account. There’s still a lot of factors to consider like the number of competitive races out there and stuff. But we do believe we’ve set ourselves up to be the kind of go-to platform for this political advertising versus maybe social media platforms and such. And we’ll have more color on this as we progress in 2022, more in the second half of the year, but definitely look forward to some tailwinds there. And then whatever, Jeff, you want to add on top.\\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. I’ll just add a little bit more color. So first, I’ve been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months, and that’s in large part because there’s just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets, we’re seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadn’t embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players, we’re seeing them move relatively quickly, which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where there’s pauses or there’s – I’ve seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA, the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So I’ve got both of the trips in the last 4 months, more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks, which is when there’s some economic pressure or they have to do more with less, they become very data-driven, and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And that’s exactly what I’m seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political, I’ll just underline what Blake said on – the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But I’ll just say lastly, on the political, we – I’m really proud of what we’ve proven in the last couple of election cycles, which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way, there’s room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums, including, in some cases, in social. So we’re really excited about what we’ve proven in the past and believe that we’ve set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\\nJason Helfstein: I’ll just ask one. Just want to focus back on CTV. So for a very long time, Google wanted to get into this, and the media companies don’t want them basically doing programmatic CTV. While they let them do YouTube TV, right, that YouTube isn’t doing the ads. And we’ve seen media companies try to own technology assets – ad tech assets and have not been good at it. And I guess, Jeff, your perspective, I mean, given what we’ve now almost seen as kind of like the undoing of some of the media mergers, where there’s like a clear idea that content owners need to be content owners and maybe just be the best of that because it’s so competitive, just how do you see how that kind of impacts your space on the board, and ultimately, to be potentially like the default partner to help the media companies with this transition?\\nJeff Green: Yes. So I think your assessment sort of that’s built into your question is spot on. I just – I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think it’s really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disney’s, of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think that’s somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think it’s just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space, being one of, and in many cases, the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world, and they’re leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. It’s just really incredible. And that’s largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We don’t own any content. We are constantly – well, publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain, but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think that’s the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are, to some extent, doing the exact same thing, they – even companies like that, that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because we’re all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything, right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic, especially in the intersection of media and tech.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\\nBrent Thill: Maybe if you can give us a quick update on Walmart and any critical milestones that you’ve had and how you look at that through the second half of ‘22.\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. Yes. If there’s any topic that didn’t get its due, it’s – I don’t know, it’s a rival between our data marketplace and our shopper marketing efforts. And so as I did mention, though, we just finished our first full quarter with Walmart. We saw over 200 advertisers. These are all very large brands – provide test budgets during that time. We expect even more large brands and more expansion as we continue forward. And we think that this is going to be just an amazing growth driver over the next 5 years. We, of course, saw some early tests and some amazing results from CPGs, as you might expect. But I don’t know that enough has been said about what is being done by companies like Walgreens and Target and Drizly, and this Target’s division Roundel because what they’re largely doing is really changing the way measurement works in CPG and really anything that’s primarily built – I’m sorry, bought off-line because what it makes possible is the ability t’ measure from the –me’you show the ad to the time somebody buys the product and measure that end-to-end using retail data instead of a walled garden or technology companies sort of grading their own homework data. And so by having that collection there, we now put together this mosaic that really creates this amazing marketplace that we even call the measurement marketplace for anybody that’s selling products that are largely bought in those stores. And then, of course, those stores spin their flywheel faster. So the green shoots are fantastic. We’ve merely scratched the surface, but we’re very excited about the start that we’ve had and very excited about our partnerships with Walmart, Walgreens and Drizly, Roundel, and GoJet and Flybuys and so many others. I’m not even listing half of the internationals, but very excited about all the progress.\\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company.\\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, I was just hoping you could maybe define what you consider the large publisher market in terms of having, I guess, the majority of loyal signed-in users and how many you think you need to sign on to UID2 for your platform to come close to replacing cookie scale, when and if Google shuts down cookies? And then just in terms of UID2, what's the status on finding an administrator for UID2, and particularly the importance of that in Europe? Appreciate answers to those.\\nJeff Green: You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users, it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on, but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept, there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in, in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly, this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general, we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in, in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much, much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?\\nMark Zgutowicz: Yes. So I was just wondering if you – what the progress is on finding an administrator for UID2? By administrator, meaning somebody who’s willing to accept liability for violations of GDPR.\\nA –Jeff Green: Yes. So because of the fact that – so first, there’s a European issue, and then there’s the administrator issue in other parts of the world as well, including in the United States. The position that we’ve taken so far is that we wanted to make UID2 an open source project so that it was available to everybody and sort of administering or managing that code base so that it could be available to everybody was the most important first order of business. And that we’ve done with the IAB, and we’ve done that based here in the United States, but it’s available everywhere in the world. As it relates to administration of its operation, because essentially, you’re handing over control at that point, it’s a double-edged sword. You can hand over a liability. You can also hand over some of its future. That’s something that we want to be very certain is good and secure before we hand that off. So we’re in no rush to do that, whether that’s with [IV] in the United States or any entity in Europe. And because in Europe, everybody is essentially taking some amount of risk if you take on the role of controller. So I don’t believe that it’s an effective way to distribute or mitigate risk at this point. So there’s nothing – we’re in no rush to do that. And instead, what we want to make certain that we do, especially in Europe, but really everywhere around the world, is develop a system that can scale and make sure that early on, we partner with companies that we believe are being responsible, that are doing the right thing and that we establish very clearly the quid pro quos and opt-outs that are in compliance with GDPR. And we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant ID in the world, but we will make it interoperable with others that we believe are also doing the right thing, and that’s going to create a better Internet, one that I think is really important for Europe and optimistic that we’ll continue to see scale. But we’re much more early days in EUID than we are in UID2 because there’s just a lot more things to consider and a much more political environment. So I’m just excited of the progress at this point.\\nOperator: The final question will be from Michael Morris from Guggenheim.\\nMichael Morris: I’ll try to squeeze in 2 final questions. The first one is on the pretty consistent comment that you made, Jeff, about The Trade Desk being the default DSP for the open Internet. Obviously, this implies potential for a pretty universal adoption across buyers. So I’m curious if you can elaborate on where you are now in terms of partner penetration. You referenced over 1,000 customers. But any frame of reference or what that means for full penetration, sort of how that’s been trending would be helpful. And the second question is a little bit of elaboration on the impacts of Netflix and other peers introducing these global ad-supported businesses, which are pretty new to market, of course. Does this drive an acceleration in your investment internationally? Any other kind of fundamental changes that this makes to the industry?\\nA –Jeff Green: You bet. So as it relates to partner penetration, I’m trying to think of the best way to quantify it. In general, I believe that we have only scratched the surface. I’m sometimes referencing last year, we had over $6 billion flow through the platform, but we’re still looking at a nearly $1 trillion TAM in terms of what’s spent in total global advertising. So we’re still just merely scratching the surface and a tiny amount of what’s possible. When you look at how many of those dollars are spent in the Fortune 500, while we’re very encouraged by what we’ve done inside of the Fortune 500 among the biggest advertisers, when you become the default for them and learn how to support the most sophisticated in the world, of course, it then gives you room to do similar things for midsized businesses, midsized agencies as we’ve always supported agencies. We continue to expand among – more and more midsized agencies, and that’s giving us a wider variety of clients, which is why we added so many advertisers both directly and through agencies in Q1. So I think this was a quarter where we added more to the sort of quantity of advertisers and agencies than we usually have. But it then tees up the opportunity for us to then get a greater share of wallet where I think there’s just still way more upside than sort of dollars we already have. You asked if the – the expansion that we’re seeing, especially from these global CTV players, if that will increase our investment around the world. I do think it will. Maybe not immediately, but I believe that investment will happen in the coming months and quarters. And that’s largely because it’s difficult to pay for a subscription and avoid the ads. Like in the prepared remarks, I made that reference or the analogy to traditional television where it’s really a luxury to pay for a station that doesn’t have any ads. It costs more. And so if you think about most markets outside the United States have a median household income that is lower than the United States. And so as a result, most of them would prefer to pay by seeing ads than by paying a premium. And especially if you’re fighting like hell to go get more subscribers, that becomes the very best way for you to grow in new markets. Incidentally, advertisers also love that, especially when you’re looking at places like Asia, but even some of the markets in Europe, where there’s just such a growth of middle class not to – occur – or occurring right now that just is a great time to advertise when people’s wealth is growing for the first time to levels that give them sort of unprecedented purchasing power. So I definitely think that will result in investments from us around the world. And I do think it will change the CTV landscape around the world to have companies that were historically U.S. companies that continue to become more of a force internationally. And I think ad-supported business models will make them stronger competitors around the world, not weaker.\\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference.
