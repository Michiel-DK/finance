Following an incredibly strong start to fiscal twenty two, we delivered an outstanding second quarter performance as our top line accelerated even further ahead of pre pandemic levels and we produced record Q2 EPS that well exceeded our expectations. With much stronger revenue highlighted by robust full price selling and good expense management, our second quarter profit for our footwear businesses also set a new record. 02:23 The levels at which our business performed during the first half of the year following a challenging fiscal twenty one reflects the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, close connections with our customers and the compelling execution of our footwear focused strategy to transform our business and deliver these results. 02:44 We are a stronger company coming out of the pandemic. Our results highlight the work we've done to accelerate online sales and enhance our store and omnichannel offerings as we create and curate leading footwear brands to be the destination for our consumers favorite fashion footwear. 03:04 Our teams continue to do a superb job providing the right product our customers are looking for combined with exceptional service and differentiated shopping experiences. Our outperformance was driven by better than anticipated results across the board with all businesses exceeding pre pandemic profit levels. 03:26 As excited as we are with the progress we are making, we are even more excited about our strategy and our future opportunity to build upon this foundation and drive growth, profit, and shareholder value. 03:41 I'll begin by providing some highlights from the quarter.

This was driven by a ninety seven percent increase in digital revenue compared to fiscal year twenty as we retained almost eighty percent of last year's volume which was elevated due to store closures. 04:40 Next, driving much higher conversion and transaction size to deliver store sales that were almost at pre pandemic levels, increasing gross margin by six forty basis points versus last year and fifty basis points compared to fiscal twenty driven primarily by higher full price selling. 04:59 Leveraging adjusted SG&A by two thirty basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels and further strengthening of our already strong balance sheet and cash position enabling a balanced approach of investing in our business while also returning capital to shareholders going forward. As the vaccine rollout continued and economies on both side of the Atlantic more broadly reopened, consumers aided by government stimulus, stepped up their footwear purchasing in the quarter and chose to shop with our brands to satisfy their pent up demand. 05:35 We were pleased that every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations. Digital has been a key strategic initiative and the investments we've made have allowed us to double our e-commerce business in two years. However, we've also talked about how much our customers enjoy our store experience and the important role of our stores as a strategic asset in a compelling omnichannel offering, which proved out once again this quarter. 06:05 So, turning now to discuss each business in more detail beginning\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",

The Journeys team once again did a tremendous job capitalizing on current market momentum and achieved record revenue and operating profit in the second quarter marking the third consecutive quarter with record profitability. 06:26 Journeys performance as we emerge from the pandemic, highlights the competitive advantage the business has built and how we are leveraging those advantages to further separate ourselves from the rest of the industry as the destination for fashion footwear for teens. 06:42 Leading into decades of experience, and its unparalleled vendor partnership, Journeys definitely navigated global supply chain disruptions to secure supply of the brands and styles most coveted by its customers. 06:57 The current fashion cycle, which has been shifting more to casual product placed into Journeys wheelhouse with strength in the assortment across the board, highlighted by the balance in its top ten brands evenly split in the quarter between casual and fashion athletic. 07:15 On trend merchandise assortments and effective consumer engagement through social and other channels fuel strong demand and full price selling with particular strength in women's and kids.

The Schuh team is taking advantage of this disruption, utilizing its advanced digital offering to strengthen consumer connections during the lockdowns. And those efforts are paying off as the market reopens and shoppers once again have the choice to engage with the brand either online or in-store. 08:54 Many of the product and brand trends driving Schuh’s performance as usual are the same as Journeys, but with a slightly heavier tilt towards fashion athletic. Another highlight of the second quarter was the more rapid than expected pace of Johnston & Murphy’s recovery, boosted by an improving market environment and strong demand for many of the brand's newest product offerings. 09:19 With a number of social events and family gatherings increasing and more customers returning to in person shopping. Retail traffic improved each successive month during the second quarter, building upon the gains in the first quarter. 09:34 At the same time, e-commerce revenue grew strongly, increasing over fifty percent compared to pre-pandemic levels as customers chose the digital channel to engage with the brand. We were especially pleased with the performance of J&M’s new athletically inspired casual assortment.

Rounding up the highlights from the quarter, licensed brands revenue more than doubled versus a year ago, reflecting the growing contribution from the footwear license we acquired in January twenty twenty. 11:00 Operating profit improved versus pre pandemic levels, although not at the rate we expected due to higher freight costs, which are temporarily pressuring near term margins. We continue to be very pleased with how Levi's product is selling in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys to Journeys kids to family footwear. 11:22 This has led to a strong order book for the back half and reinforces our excitement about the potential to create value by combining Powerful brand licenses with our fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities. 11:38 Turning now to the current quarter, we have been pleased with our results to date as sales track ahead of pre pandemic levels in August, and we are several weeks into the all important back to school selling season. 11:53 Last year's back to school was like none before since most children began the school year learning remotely.

       " Document(page_content=\"Tom George: 18:46 Thanks, Mimi. As Mimi mentioned, total Q2 results far exceeded our expectations and last year across the board. For comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our fiscal twenty provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance and the return of our business to pre-pandemic levels. However, when comparing to fiscal twenty, I would like to remind everyone how our strategy has changed our business. E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales and our licensed brand segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales. 19:33 These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses. While these changes will reshape the P and L, they have a positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital intensive business model. 20:00 Turning back to Q2 results, I'm pleased to report that not only did the second quarter continue, but it accelerated the sequential improvement of our operating results since the onset of the pandemic. Higher revenue and gross margin combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal twenty and Q2 adjusted earnings per share of one point zero five dollars compared to zero point one five dollars in fiscal twenty. 20:35 In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was five fifty five million, up fourteen percent compared to fiscal twenty, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, which is up ninety seven percent versus fiscal twenty, taking overall digital sales to nineteen percent of our retail business compared to ten percent in fiscal twenty twenty. 21:04 Digital growth combined with much higher wholesale revenue drove strong sales improvements for Journeys shoe and license brands\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='much higher wholesale revenue drove strong sales improvements for Journeys shoe and license brands compared to pre-pandemic levels, while J&M made significant strides narrowing its revenue gap. We did not provide overall or store comp results for Q2 as our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for seven consecutive days either this year or last year, and therefore, we feel that overall sales is a more meaningful metric. 21:40 With stores open for ninety seven percent of the possible days in the quarter, overall store revenue was down only one percent versus fiscal twenty. Consolidated gross margin was forty nine point one percent up fifty basis points from fiscal twenty, driven by full price selling, partially offset by the mix shift towards license brands and higher shipping costs from higher penetration of e-commerce. 22:12 While e-commerce puts pressure on our gross margin rate, as I mentioned, it comes with a lower cost structure and double digit operating income. Journeys gross margin increased two twenty basis points, driven by lower markdowns in both stores and online. Schuh’s gross margin decreased two hundred basis points due entirely to the higher shipping expense from the shift in e-commerce channel mix. 22:44 J&M’s gross margin increased five seventy basis points benefiting from fewer markdowns taken on pack-and-hold inventory and higher full price selling. 22:56 Finally, the revenue growth of license brands, typically our lowest gross margin rate negatively impacted the overall mix by ninety basis points. Adjusted SG&A expense was forty five point three percent, a two thirty basis point improvement compared to fiscal twenty twenty as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions around expense management. 23:25 The largest year over year savings came from occupancy cost, driven by the UK Government program, which provides property tax relief, rent concession across our businesses and ongoing rent savings on renewals. 23:42 The next', metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"relief, rent concession across our businesses and ongoing rent savings on renewals. 23:42 The next largest areas of savings came from the reduction in store salaries, thanks to the effective use of workforce management tools to drive higher conversion in the face of significant wage pressure. These savings were partially offset by higher incentive compensation, driven by improved profitability and increased marketing expenses needed to drive traffic in both stores and online. 24:14 As the multi-year shift in consumer traffic continues towards online and away from brick and mortar, our organization has been intently focused on the critical effort to right-size occupancy cost to be in line with store traffic. The pandemic has exacerbated the transition to digital and we continue to have even greater traction on rent reductions. 24:40 Year to date through Q2 we have negotiated seventy five renewals and achieved a twenty nine percent reduction in rent expense in North America. This was on top of a twenty two percent reduction for one hundred and twenty three renewals last year. These renewals are for even shorter term average in approximately two years compared to the three year average we have seen in recent years. 25:09 With over forty percent of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this will remain a key priority for us going forward. 25:18 In summary, the second quarter's adjusted operating income was twenty one point one million versus fiscal 2020’s four point seven million. All operating divisions achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal led by Journeys nearly one hundred and seventy percent increase. Our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was twenty five percent. 25:45 Turning now to the balance sheet. Q2 total inventory was down twenty seven percent compared to fiscal twenty on sales that were up fourteen percent as we remain challenged, keeping pace with the consumer demand levels and with delivery delays.

       " Document(page_content=\"as we remain challenged, keeping pace with the consumer demand levels and with delivery delays. Our ending net cash position was two eighty four million, seventy million dollars higher than the first quarter's level driven by strong cash generation from operations. 26:14 As a reminder, we currently have ninety million dollars remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase plan, and we have a solid track record of returning cash to our shareholders. Capital expenditures were eight million dollars as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel and depreciation and amortization was eleven million. We closed eight stores and opened three during the second quarter. 26:45 We will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or full fiscal twenty twenty two. However, I would like to provide some color around our expectations using the pre-pandemic fiscal twenty as the reference point. As we transition into Q3, thus far, we have experienced a more normalized back to school selling season for Journeys and Schuh, but is expected the impact from stimulus has moderated and due to the spread of the Delta variant, there are more questions around when customers will begin returning to their offices, which will impact J&M’s trend and whether Delta will disrupt in-store shopping. Supply chain disruptions persist, pressuring both the top line and product cost. 27:38 Now getting to more specifics of Q3 starting with revenue. We expect higher revenue compared to fiscal twenty levels, given the strength of our assortment. This is mainly due to continued strength from the Levi's business and growth at Journeys and Schuh. J&M will likely remain under fiscal twenty’s level. 28:03 Directionally, the overall sales increase for Q3 compared to fiscal twenty twenty could be up mid-to-high single-digits. From a channel perspective, the highest growth will once again come from wholesale and direct. We expect gross margin rates for Q3 will be somewhat under fiscal twenty levels,\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"and direct. We expect gross margin rates for Q3 will be somewhat under fiscal twenty levels, due to substantial pressure from import freight increases at J&M and license brands from supply chain disruptions. 28:37 We expect the retail promotional environment to remain favorable, offsetting the ongoing pressure from higher e-commerce penetration and the higher shipping cost that come with it, as well as the impact of licensed brands growth, on our business model as previously discussed. 28:59 We expect that Q3 adjusted SG&A will be a little better as a percentage of sales than in fiscal twenty twenty. Sequentially, we will not see the large SG&A leverage we saw in Q2 as revenue growth will be lower and the benefits from some government relief programs will be less than Q2. 29:23 That being said, compared to fiscal twenty, higher revenue will boost leverage in both occupancy and selling salaries partially offset by higher marketing and performance based compensation as we anticipate higher bonus expense than fiscal twenty twenty. 29:40 In summary, we expect the operating income to be similar to fiscal year twenty levels and the margin rate to be somewhat lower than fiscal year twenty due to these factors, in particular, the increased import freight in our branded businesses. 29:58 For taxes, we expect the Q3 tax rate to be around the twenty five percent we saw in Q2. The annual tax rate is expected to be approximately thirty percent. In addition when comparing results, we had some expense pickups like rent abatements in the back half of fiscal twenty one, particularly in Q4. We don't expect to recur in the back half this year. 30:27 Next, I would like to provide a brief update on our cost savings initiative. Given the shift of our business from stores to digital, accelerated by the impact from the pandemic, we continue to make progress on reshaping our cost structure and allocating resources towards digital growth. 30:45 As a reminder, our target for the year is to\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",

The entire organization is focused on this critical initiative, and I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress towards our target. 31:11 The teams have identified over twenty million dollars of savings with the largest amount coming from rent and the remainder in several areas, including increased selling salary productivity, travel conventions, inner store freight, marketing, compensation and other overheads. These savings benefit primarily the store channel and its profitability. 31:39 The cost savings initiative is a key pillar in our strategy to transform our business. Designed to reflect a more capital efficient model, focusing on driving further improvements in return on invested capital and allowing for improved flexibility in our operating model. Going forward, we see opportunities to be less dependent on store capital expenditures have lower lease obligations and continue to drive efficient use of inventory. 32:11 In conclusion, I would like to thank all our employees for such an incredible start to the fiscal year.

Please proceed with your question.\\nMitch Kummetz: 33:11 Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Let me start with the guidance or the outlook for Q3. So, I think you said sales up mid-to-high single-digits on a two year basis. Can you say kind of where August came in relative to that? Is August better than that? You're expecting some moderation or can you maybe just provide a little color on that?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 33:37 Sure. Let me – hi, Mitch, it’s Mimi. Let me start and then turn it over to Tom. I think that it's important to put August in the dimension of what happened last year with back to school and also this year. So things were a lot different a year ago. We estimated that two thirds of students attended school only virtually to start the year. 34:00 This year, we estimated that there was a real push to get kids back into school and we're estimating that essentially all students went back in person. And so, we had a great second quarter and coming into the quarter we thought that back to school also would be positive and we have continued to see, we've been pleased with the results so far, we've got the right assortment. We've been pleased with what we have seen. 34:28 One important note is that the Labor Day this year compared to fiscal year twenty and that's what we keep comparing to is, one week later. So, we're going to know basically this weekend, what the comparison period is. So, we're tracking to and above fiscal year twenty levels overall, and we'll know more when we complete the Labor Day weekend. We also think that there is a likelihood of back to school having a longer tail in September and October, like it did last year. 35:06 We didn't see a lot of sales in July and August last year, but people waited to see exactly what might happen in schools and there was more purchasing later on. And Tom I don’t know if you had anything to add to that?\\nTom George: 35:19 No, I think that's a good summary. We feel really good how we're tracking so far and keep in mind; we have more of a wholesale business this year as well relative to two years ago. So, that tracks really at a different pace than the retail business and we do expect some good growth out of our direct channel as well this year relative to two years ago. So, feel really good where we're tracking so far.\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 35:46 Yeah. And I'd also remind you mentioned that August is a really important month that's over forty percent of the third quarter because of how heavy back to school is. So, it's good to have that month behind us.\\nMitch Kummetz: 35:58 Okay. And then Tom on gross margin, you mentioned that you expect gross margin to be below twenty twenty levels for the quarter you just reported. I think you're up around fifty bps ahead of two years ago. So, is the difference all on freight or are there other factors that are putting a little bit more pressure on Q3 versus Q2 on a two year basis?\\nTom George: 36:23 The big difference there is freight. There's a significant amount of freight in the second quarter. I mean, we’re planning on approximately rounded numbers around seven million dollars of additional freight in the third quarter and that has a big impact on the gross margin percentage and a big impact on our operating income results relative to two years ago.\\nMitch Kummetz: 36:47 And just to be clear, is that seven million dollars more than two years ago or seven million more than what you saw in Q2, just help me understand with that?\\nTom George: 36:55 Relative to two years ago and it's a combination of additional vessel charges; it's a combination of airfreight things like that to get the product into our consumer’s hands. So, it's a big difference relative to two years ago. It's just a part of the results as some of the supply chain challenges out there, but we think we've got our hands around it to manage it and we think we've got our exposure included in the back half projection. And we also have some in the fourth quarter as well that have got in our projections just to be cautious.\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mitch Kummetz: 37:30 Okay. Do you know off offhand what the other freight was in Q2 versus years ago? It was more minimal when we really started to see the backup of the supply chain. And particularly in our branded business, we are having to airfreight product and that's pretty meaningful. I think you’ve seen the container cost go up pretty significantly. So, it's really much more pressure in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter.\\nTom George: 38:02 And Mitch in the second quarter it was almost two million dollars.\\nMitch Kummetz : 38:05 Okay. And then lastly, just on the supply chain, how much longer you think these disruptions will occur? I mean, does this linger in through like the first half of next year? And can you speak to kind of your ability to get product maybe versus some of your competition? I know that for a lot of your brands, you're the largest or one of the larger customers and I'm just wondering, kind of how much of a competitive that advantage that is in the environment of a challenging supply chain?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 38:38 Yes. So, we think it's a huge competitive advantage in this environment because is not a new problem. We've been managing through supply chain challenges really since the onset of the pandemic and we've been chasing inventory all the way through, basically last quarter what came in went right back out and yet sales were strong and sales has just continued to be strong. 39:05 So, in our retail business, we're seeing good products flow right now, but it's lower than we would like We have worked on mitigating the risk by ordering higher sales in our projection. So that would help us. And we – so that we can get caught up with some suppliers and we also ordered early and strong, certainly on some core retail style styles. We're an important partner to our brands. They've worked with us as much as possible. Journeys always get more than fair share of products. 39:38 So, we've got the window to re-inventory before holiday and think that it will certainly be challenge to holiday and from what we can see right now, even into the spring possibly, but there's a lot of time between here and there. Factories have been latest situation and there is time to address some of the situation there and then everybody is focused on clearing up some of the problems in the supply chain, but certainly through holiday and perhaps in the spring as well.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:08 Great. Thank you.\\nTom George: 40:11 I think maybe I’d add because we are such a strong strategic partner to our key suppliers, we took advantage of that and ordered early and higher on some key styles for fall.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:25 Perfect.

       " Document(page_content=\"Steve Marotta: 40:37 Good morning, Mimi and Tom, let me offer my congrats to on the second quarter. Can you please remind us the twenty five million dollars to thirty million dollars of cost savings? Can you talk about how that will be realized and what the cadence is there? And if there possible that there's anything behind that you've alluded to in prepared remarks, continued ways of making the business less capital intensive? Thanks.\\nTom George: 41:03 Yes, Steve. So, we're good progress. We've identified twenty that's on an annualized basis and we believe in the back half, we can realize half of that in the form of those items are outlined on the call. Occupancy expenses better selling salary productivity. We have fewer stores. We're going to have savings and depreciation. We've got some procurement initiatives. 41:27 So, roughly half of that twenty million dollars will be realized over the back half. And on the capital light model, I mean, we've got a good wholesale business now. And you can manage your inventories well, our situation we have with the Togast acquisition which is a very capital light model. 41:48 Fewer capital expenditures evolved obviously with the wholesale business because you're not opening up stores. Another driver of the capital light model is our digital business. It's a very variable cost model and we've made investments historically and we're leveraging off those investments going forward. 42:06 So, we feel really good how capital efficient the models come and we'll continue to look at cost savings as well as working on the capital base to continue to drive good returns on invested capital.\\nSteve Marotta: 42:21 That's helpful. And we're seeing across the space when cost savings like this are being implemented, a lot of that is being reinvested in digital marketing and demand creation investments. Is that your intent here as well? Or is it literally a net number coming right out of the P&L?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 42:41 So, Steve, certainly, we are investing a lot in digital marketing and in demand creation and we have to do that for both our websites and to our stores. I think the key here is that our e-commerce channel is profitable. And the investments that we're making in digital marketing are actually generating a return. And so we think about that in terms of those channel economics. 43:10 When we think about the brick and mortar side, the challenges there really are to reduce occupancy expense and that's why we've been so focused on that. And if you think about, if we can align occupancy to the appropriate level of traffic right now, and we are spending a little bit more on advertising. So part of the way we're thinking about being able to fund that advertising is through the rent reduction. So, the way we're thinking about this is channel on a channel specific basis.\\nSteve Marotta: 43:46 Very helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator: 43:51 Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\\nJonathan Komp: 43:57 Yeah. Good morning. Thank you and hope everyone is staying safe. I want to just first to follow-up on the supply chain topic. I know, you don't have guidance into next year, but just given the situation with the factories are there scenarios you're hearing from your brands where there might be a shortage of product to sell even more than – more so than what you've faced so far? Just wanted to get your current assessment of the situation with the factory closures and the impact it might have?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 44:29 Sure. Thanks for that question, John. I think that when you think about both Journeys and Schuh business, which represent probably eighty percent of our business. The key is that we are diversified across a number of suppliers. And I think that that gives us a real advantage and we've talked a little bit about how important we are to our suppliers, the great partnerships that we have had and the prioritization that we get as a result of how important we are to them. And so the key for us is just the diversification that all suppliers are working hard that they're in a number of different factories and in this case, having multiple brands is a benefit for us.\\nJonathan Komp: 45:16 Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe a bigger picture topic than on really the sustainability of the margin performance and coming off of a first half where you’re typically not very profitable and you were quite profitable this year. How should we think about really the ongoing ability to drive higher margin with everything you've talked about and the increased focus on footwear portfolio, but how are you thinking about what's sort of sustainable versus other benefits that maybe we should expect to continue and how that relates to your broader margin opportunity?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 45:59 Sure. So, John, it's a great question. And I think we're so pleased with the results that we had in the first half, there's no question that there were unique factors in terms of the consumer being in a really great place to spend because of stimulus and other government help, there was pent up demand as well. But I think if you look at what specifically we are doing to drive the business. The first thing is around digital and we've talked about how digital is such a profitable part of our overall business. 46:31 We were able to double the size of the e-com business to the course of the pandemic, which means significantly more profit contribution and that'll be in every quarter of the year. We've also talked about rent expense and how important an initiative that is to improve the profitability on the brick and mortar side. And Tom said today, our improvements are just a little under thirty percent and that's compounding on a twenty plus percent last year compounding on eight percent to ten percent in prior years. 47:04 So through a compounding effect, that helps as well. And so we feel like there is a real path to be able with those couple of things plus the growth of the branded side of our business those license brands and this opportunity to re-imagine Johnston & Murphy. We saw the same thing coming out of the great recession. We had a chance to really take the brand up to the next level. And we think there is tremendous opportunity to do that through re-invention of the product, re-invention of the marketing, which is underway right now. 47:40 And so we saw a doubling of Johnston & Murphy’s brand really coming out of the great recession. We think there's an opportunity again to take Johnston & Murphy to the level. So, I think the combination of those three things give us great earnings potential going forward irrespective of the things that were unique to the first half of the year.\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Tom George: 48:03 And I think I’d add again with being a key asset to all the major relevant brands in the retail side of our business. We have the ability because another strength we have is our ability to merchandise product and service product and convert sales, we got the ability, I think everything else being equal to drive some really good gross margins going forward to continue to do that. And with Johnston & Murphy and our license brands business, we have the ability to drive good gross margins and some improvement in those going forward. 48:36 And then just a reminder in the wholesale business on the operating income level, we've got visibility in line of sight that the wholesale business as well is going to be double-digit operating margin going forward.\\nJonathan Komp: 48:50 Okay, great. Just last one for me. The incentive compensation piece, can you just, sorry if I missed this, but can you give us an update where you're tracking this year given the increase in the corporate expenses that we can see and then how should we think about kind of a normalized level after this year? Thank you.\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'GCO', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2GCO'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Mimi Vaughn: 49:12 So, thanks for that question. So, I think an important point to make is that we paid no incentive compensation last year. The way that our program works is that since the pandemic caused substantial disruption, to our operating results even though our team navigated the pandemic so well, constraining expenses and capital and improving liquidity that's because we didn't have year over year improvement, no performance compensation was paid. 49:44 This year, there is a substantial improvement in earnings on a lower capital base and our plan is designed to be highly aligned with shareholder interest as the bonus is generated for the incremental improvement. And so part of what you are seeing in the corporate expense is the booking of bonus, higher level of bonus this year versus two years ago. And we will see a little bit of that in the back half as well, but given the strong performance, that's how the bonus centers up being booked in the second quarter.\\nJonathan Komp: 50:20 Any willingness to quantify just so we can understand the moving pieces in the SG&A?\\nTom George: 50:28 No, we normally don't get into that level at detail, John. I think another point to be made though is, reinforce just a huge year over year improvement we had in economic value added because we did have big year over year improvement earnings on a much lower capital base that this year would be – the bonus related incentive compensation would be higher than we'd normally expect in future years.\\nOperator: 50:58 Thank you.

Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 01:08 Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information.

       " Document(page_content=\"Leo Denault: 01:24 Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share, a very good start for the year. With favorable weather and higher-than-planned retail sales, we are ahead of schedule and solidly on track to achieve our 2022 objectives. And we remain on track for our longer-term outlooks. During the quarter, we continued to execute on both our near and long-term deliverables, just as we have over the last several years. We've made demonstrable progress on our operational, strategic and financial objectives. 02:03 Operationally, I'll start with some notable regulatory updates. We've continued to make meaningful progress on storm cost recovery. Texas is done and Louisiana's securitization proceeds from the 2020 storms, plus $1 billion towards IDA will be completed in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana's filing for the balance of IDA will be completed within the coming days, and the Entergy New Orleans filing will follow later this year. A financially strong utility is important for customers. Drew will discuss how securitization progress supports our balance sheet strength. 02:44 As expected, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual formula rate plan which enables continued customer-centric investment and supports our financial outlooks. We're continuing to drive progress on enhancing the resilience of our system, which benefits customers that supports local economic activity as well as our growth plan. Entergy Louisiana completed an important transmission upgrade in the southern part of the state. This $86 million project replaced approximately 80 structures to increase resilience along several miles of critical path transmission in La Pouch Paris, an area that was severely affected by Hurricane Ida last year. To create a solid foundation, the new infrastructure is placed in steel cases. 03:32 The line was built to withstand wind speeds of 150 miles per hour and will improve the resilience of the\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",

Entergy Louisiana also completed a $100 million project in North Louisiana, that positions the region for economic growth. The West Monroe project will provide additional transition capacity, improve reliability and is built to withstand extreme weather events. What that means for customers is enhanced reliability and resilience, better integration of clean generating resources and economic benefits to improved access to lower cost of power. Bottom line, the Entergy team continues to focus on delivering operational excellence across all facets of our business. 04:15 Strategically, I'll start with our merchant business wind down. The last step in our merchant nuclear exit is nearly complete. Palisades is on track to shut down at the end of May with the sale to Holtec following around mid-year. The Palisades team is fishing strong, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated service. We have worked to help employees with their career goals beyond the plant shutdown. Many will continue to work for Entergy at other locations. Some will continue to work for Holtec on decommissioning and others are retiring. 04:50 As you know, DOE recently announced a program to save nuclear plants that are about to shut down. Michigan's Governor issued a letter encouraging utilization of this program to keep Palisades open. We are supportive of federal initiatives to keep nuclear plants operating. However, we are five years into Palisades shutdown process. We're far down the path. There are significant technical and commercial hurdles to changing course at this point. That said, alongside Holtec, we will work with any qualified party that wants to explore acquiring the plant and obtaining federal funding. 05:29 But I do want to be very clear, this does not change our strategy.

       " Document(page_content=\"Entergy is exiting the merchant nuclear business, even if Palisades continues to operate as a part of Entergy. Across all of our operating companies, we continue to be a critical partner to support strong economic development, bringing new businesses, new jobs and new tax base in the communities we serve. For example, Entergy Arkansas, along with the Wynne Economic Development Corporation announced completion of the select site certification for a 37-acre industrial site. Certification streamlines site selection process. Initiatives like this help track new businesses and new projects like the U.S. Steel expansion that was announced earlier this year. 06:17 Over the past five years, our economic development team has helped bring to provision close to 300 announced projects, $42 billion of capital investments, and more than 25,000 jobs. These outcomes have been critical to the economic health of our communities and have been a significant factor in the 9% cumulative industrial sales growth we've achieved over the past five years. And we continue to expect significant industrial expansion in the next several years. 06:50 As we have discussed, growth from our industrial customers has been driven in large part by cost, labor, logistics and regulatory advantages of the Gulf Coast as well as favorable commodity spreads, which continue to support expansion. Further, the current geopolitical state of the world makes the U.S. and the Gulf Coast in particular, a top choice for stability. 07:15 LNG exporters in the Gulf are being called on to expand production to help reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy influence. This opportunity represents a win for our customers, communities and owners, not to mention the community.

That's more than half of the 11,000 megawatts of renewable resources in our supply plan through 2030. 08:05 We've made progress identifying new resources and active RFPs. Since our last call, Entergy Texas concluded evaluations of its 2021 solar RFP. Several resources were selected totaling at least 400 megawatts from owned and contracted proposals. We also made selections from the Louisiana and Arkansas 2021 RFPs earlier in the year. We will provide additional details about the resources selected from these proposals once parties reach definitive agreements. 08:39 We are also soliciting the next round of renewables. Entergy Arkansas recently issued its RFP seeking up to 500 megawatts of renewables to provide cost-effective clean energy, which furthers fuel diversity. Entergy Louisiana also issued notice to proceed with renewable RFP seeking up to 1,500 megawatts in Louisiana. Our customers' demand for decarbonization solutions, including green products is not slowing down. The long-term solar market continues to look favorable based on an improving technology curve and higher natural gas price scenarios. However, we fully recognize the near-term cost and schedule pressures that solar projects are facing. 09:25 Supply chain constraints have been exacerbated by the Department of Commerce investigation, which we expect will drive additional delays and the potential for further cost increases. These dynamics are affecting the entire U.S. solar industry, but we are continuing to work through these constraints and are executing on our solar expansion plans. It's important to note that not all of our projects are affected.

Roughly half of owned projects in the three-year horizon are not experiencing impacts of recent marketing constraints. A greater portion of our own projects are expected in the latter half of the decade, which would be past the current working insurance. As we've said before, we have a large backlog of customer-centric investments with the ability to rotate capital into our plan as an opening presents itself. The bottom line is that we recognize the near and medium-term constraints, still see strong market fundamentals in the long term supports our supply demand and customer objectives. 10:47 On our last call, we told you about the new U.S. Steel expansion. In support of this project and the customers' decarbonization goals, Entergy Arkansas filed for approval to acquire the 250 megawatt driver solar facility. Driver solar is an example of how we can partner with customers with their sustainability needs while accelerating the growth of our renewable portfolio in our regulated framework. It also highlights our unique growth strategy to help customers achieve the outcomes they desire, which in turn drives the outcomes for all Entergy’s stakeholders through more jobs and economic activity in our service area, increased capital deployment to support electrification, low growth to offset costs and higher rate of change towards societal decarbonization. 11:38 Nuclear also plays a critical role in our customer decarbonization strategy. Entergy is one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the nation due to our nuclear fleet. Customers are increasingly highlighting access to carbon renewable resources is key to economic development.

We continue to see examples in the industry that reinforce the need to balance reliability, supportability, environmental sustainability. Entergy's resource planning has always balanced these objectives. Our baseload nuclear plays an important role. 12:20 We have discussed the sizable long-term opportunity for Entergy to help our industrial customers decarbonize and achieve their sustainability unit levels. We had estimate an addressable market of approximately 30 terawatt hours by 2030. To put that into context, that's about 25% of our 2021 total retail sales. That's not to say that we capture the entire market, but we're working how to serve our customers' needs and maximize this opportunity. With many carbon reduction goals coming past 2030, achieve greater opportunities beyond the next 10 years. 12:59 Realizing this growth requires significant investment benefits to all stakeholders. This will include meaningful transmission and distribution investments to reliably serve the expansion of our renewable beyond the [indiscernible] in our current 2030 resource.

       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 15:12 Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for the first quarter. As you can see on Slide 3, we had adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share. The drivers are straightforward and keep us solidly on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year. We remain confident in our continued success and we are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlook. 15:37 Turning to Slide 4, you'll see the drivers for the quarter. As a result of our continued customer-centric investments, we saw higher levels of revenue as well as higher depreciation and interest expenses. Other O&M increases included higher customer service support and nuclear generation expenses. 15:56 Results for EWC are summarized on Slide 5. The drivers for that business are largely due to the shutdown sale of Indian Point last year. As Leo mentioned, we expect to complete our exit of the merchant nuclear business in the coming months. That will be a major strategic milestone. 16:19 Moving to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was higher than last year at $538 million. Higher utility revenue, lower fuel and purchase power payments and lower pension contributions were the largest drivers. As a reminder, fuel and purchase power payments were significantly impacted by winter storm Uri in 2021. Non-capital storm spending was higher than last year, which provided a partial offset. 16:48 Turning to credit and liquidity on Slide 7. We continue to make progress on securitizations that will strengthen our balance sheet to produce significant cost savings for our customers. Our regulators recognize that financially healthy utilities benefit our customers. To that end, Entergy Texas recently completed securitization for its 2020 storms. And on the day of our last call, the LPSC approved storm recovery and financing for the 2020 storm plus $1 million down payment on Hurricane Ida. 17:22 The approval included replenishment of Louisiana storm escrow to $290\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"on Hurricane Ida. 17:22 The approval included replenishment of Louisiana storm escrow to $290 million. Louisiana securitization is expected to be off balance sheet, and we anticipate a $3.2 billion issuance in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana plans to file for Ida cost recovery in the coming days, as Leo mentioned, we are targeting to receive proceeds by year-end. The timing of recovery ultimately depend on procedural schedule approved by the commission. 17:53 Entergy New Orleans is seeking approval on the New Orleans City Council to issue $150 million in securitized bonds to replenish the company's storm reserve. If approved, this reserve would enhance credit and ability to respond to potential future storms. In addition, ENO plans to file for Ida cost recovery later this year. Our net liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, being further supported by the tax securitization proceeds received on April 1, and the $3.2 billion Louisiana securitization proceeds once they are received. 18:33 Beyond securitization and liquidity, we continue to focus on resilience, which we will discuss in detail at our Analyst Day. Part of that discussion will include how we are actively applying for federal funding to help pay for resilience investments and mitigate customer insights. 18:53 Looking at Slide 8. It's been approximately two months since our last earnings call. And that time, we have reduced our equity needs by nearly $170 million through our ATM program, with roughly $570 million remaining to be executed between now and the end of 2024. Given the small amount, our plan is to close out the remaining days with the ATM program. 18:53 The four sectors shown on Slide 9 represent nearly half of our industrial sales.

So viability of the asset is really a Holtec question or could there be changes to the Holtec agreement? And maybe just elaborate a little bit on some of the technical challenges like refueling and the capital that's needed to halt decommissioning and can they even be overcome?\\nLeo Denault: 21:32 Yeah. I'm nearly not going to, Shar, get into any kind of details about what would or wouldn't work. The technical details, though, around operations, the plant will have to stop operating in May because we'll be out of fuel. We haven't ordered fuel. There's a lot of work that would need to be done at the plants to prepare it to continue to operate beyond that cycle. And we really haven't done the investigation into what that work would be because as you might guess, we have been planning for five years to shut the plant down. We do have an agreement with Holtec and obviously, that has certain features in it that by and large, have all been -- all the conditions have been met, except for the plant is still operating. So it's just a real heavy lift at the last hour. 22:27 And as I said, we couldn't be more supportive of the fact that continuing operation of the country's nuclear fleet is important, the reliability of the bulk electric system and to the ability for us to decarbonize the economy, shutting those plants down is just moving backwards. But -- so I'm encouraged by those -- what DOE has got going on for future plants just at this stage with Palisades.

The one that we cited, I think, last -- at the end of last year, I guess, on the last call, was around pension. And certainly, interest rates are changing that pension liability. The returns associated with the trust supporting the pension aren't as good as we were anticipating either all that kind of balancing out. That is something that we are watching closely, if rates continue to stay high and returns turn come back around to -- closer to our expectations, then it could create some more headroom in our credit metric. That's probably the one that we are looking at most closely right now, so we're monitoring that. 24:44 In terms of, obviously, we need to get the securitizations done. We need those to be off sheet as we've discussed. Those things are going to be big milestones in terms of taking some debt off of our balance sheet. And -- but we're watching that closely as well. Outside of that, our expectations around capital, which obviously also drives our equity needs. Those are things that we're watching closely. We do have some capital associated with solar in the near term. And we can -- I'm sure there's going to be a question on the call about that. We can talk about that here in a minute. But we have other capital projects that are waiting in the wings, particularly around resilience. So if there is extra headroom for us because of delays in solar, there's quite a bit of resilience investments that our customers are waiting on and expect us to achieve if there's an opportunity.

Thanks you for taking the question.\\nLeo Denault: 27:01 Good morning.\\nNicholas Campanella: 27:02 So I just wanted to hit solar supply chain risks quick and just the impact. Could you just help us just size the amount of megawatts going into rate base that would potentially be at risk? I think you said roughly half you're secured on over the three-year horizon. So is that like 300 to 400 megawatts? And just to confirm, I heard your last comments right, to the extent that capital shifts, you were just going to backfill that with potential distribution resiliency spend?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Roderick West: 27:31 Yeah. And this is Rod. Good morning. From Leo's comments, the near-term risk that we were referring to in terms of existing owned projects was roughly 280 megawatts because we we’re discrete about both -- we're explicit about both West Memphis and Walnut Bend. And so from a megawatt standpoint, they really don't represent a material amount of capacity. So we want to make sure that we put that in some context. And recall, Leo also mentioned the lion's share of our renewable capacity actually shows up on the back end of the decade. So we're calling it out because we recognize that there are some near-term constraints, but they really don't influence, how we're thinking about our build-out.\\nLeo Denault: 28:28 And I think to your last point, Nick, I think Drew mentioned it and I mentioned in the script, we've got a capital plan and timing that's laid out. We've got other things waiting in the wings that we could or couldn't accelerate. So the ability to roll something else into the plan that provides benefits to our customers in a different way is always there.\\nNicholas Campanella: 28:56 Absolutely. And then just Drew's comments on inflation. If anywhere, where would you kind of call out that you're kind of seeing the most pressure to the plan? And can you just kind of talk about just the current state of power markets, how you're kind of managing customer bill impacts and the ability to just continue to extend your rate base growth here, perhaps any levers that makes your jurisdiction more unique than others, that would be helpful.

       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 29:23 Thanks, Nick. This is Drew. So the way you phrase it was an interesting way to think about it, in terms of putting pressure on the plan. I would actually turn that around and say that it actually enhances the economics of the plan because we think about where the inflation -- what the inflation does to our two central investment themes beyond sort of our base capital in renewables. And in resilience, we think that inflation will actually strengthen the economic case from a customer's perspective to get those things done. Certainly, when you talk about renewables and higher gas prices, there's more economic headroom there right now. And that's accelerating the pressure to get the renewables done. We've already done a lot of work around improving our gas efficiency with the CCGTs that we've built historically. And of course, the Orange County Advanced Power Station is out there as well, a high-efficiency unit. So those things are helpful already, but we think it will accelerate our plan around renewables. 30:36 And then, of course, around resilience, a key piece of the plan is the costs associated with putting up hardened lines, distribution lines, transmission lines prior to a storm compared to the cost associated with doing it after the storm. And to the extent that there is inflation, that's going to exacerbate that difference, which is already substantial, and accelerate the need for customers to do it ahead of time in a planful way. And so obviously, those things have an impact on the customer bill, but the alternative of not doing it is an even greater impact on the customer bill. So I think it will drive customers who want to accelerate our plan, which will include renewables and resilience investment.\\nNicholas Campanella: 31:30 That was very detailed.

The other ongoing projects that we are expecting a bit of delay of the ones I referenced earlier, West Memphis and Walnut Bend. We're working with our BOT partners, both of whom are reputable firms, to lock down both price and schedule certainty.

And they are -- prior to the DOC action, they were already aware of tariff activity in that space. So we expect that these folks that we have -- that we are working with coming out of the RFP will be well situated to manage through the current environment and meet the expectations that they put through in the RFPs. 34:13 We expect that the DOC fees will be resolved at some point relatively near term.

       " Document(page_content=\"Roderick West: 35:19 Yeah, Jeremy. We're certainly monitoring what's going on in the SMR space. And as you might guess our nuclear folks are involved in advisory capacities and others with various entities to make sure that we're -- we've got our finger on the pulse of where that goes. I think that the success of the technology is going to be critical to the decarbonization objectives of the economy. When you think about the ability to build cost competitive, carbon-free, smaller projects that aren't -- the issue, for example, we have with the size of the capital budgets of the existing technologies is that they're as big as the companies that fund them. And that's problematic if you got issues in construction. So we're very excited about that opportunity, when and how it fits itself into our needs, we're continuing to monitor and it's a little bit difficult to say. But certainly, I think we should all be -- room for that technology to take root. 36:31 We are spending, I know probably more of our efforts in the hydrogen space because of the unique position that we have in the hydrogen market with producers, consumers, stores, transported all in the heart of our service territory. So there's a unique advantage there. But it doesn't mean we're not staying involved in what the SMR technology could do for us and for the economy in general.\\nJeremy Tonet: 36:59 Got it. It's very helpful, I leave it there. Thanks.\\nRoderick West: 37:03 Thank you.\\nOperator: 37:05 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Durgesh Chopra: 37:13 Hey. Good morning, guys and Drew long time no see. Just -- other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up from my side. Just can you confirm that the storm Ida balance of costs, which you haven't received sort of regulatory approval for? Does that still sit at $1.7 billion? I believe that was the number as of the end of the fourth quarter call. So if you could just confirm that or update us on where that sits now?\\nAndrew Marsh: 37:47 Yeah. So the answer is the total cost estimate for that storm is still at $2.7 billion in total, $1 billion of that is in the first securitization we expect to price in the next few weeks. And the balance would be towards the end of the year. The full $2.7 billion will be part of our filing that we are making in the next couple of days. We still be -- just to clarify, we have to get approval for the full amount to get cost recovery for the full amount. That hasn't -- $1 billion down payment is not pre-approval of those costs. It's just -- it's a prefinancing.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:29 I see. So essentially, you'll be seeking approval for the full $2.7 billion and the $1 billion that you've gotten already will be applied towards it. Is that the right way to think about it?\\nAndrew Marsh: 38:41 That is correct.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:43 Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the call today.

If I can, just to focus on the first quarter and some of the dynamics here. Can you comment a little bit on the industrial demand and the 6.5% in the first quarter here? And how do you see this trend through the balance of the year as you think about it, especially given the potential for export-oriented industries to do particularly well here? And could you talk also in tandem at the same time about some of those trends that you observed specifically around accelerating customer desire for renewables? You had specifically identified at the start of this year, a number of very large customers. But I have to imagine, based on your comments already that there are actually several other larger customers that you're talking to.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 39:46 Yes. So this is Drew. I'll take the first part, and I'll turn the second part over to Rod. And so certainly, in terms of the sales expectations, we did have higher-than-anticipated industrial sales in the quarter. A lot of -- most of it was actually more or less in line. In fact, I would say, compared to our expectations, obviously, refiners, seeing very high crack spreads performed well. We did have some unplanned outages in some of the chemical and petrochemical space, which pulled us down a bit. And then there are unplanned outages for our Cogent customers, and that actually lifted us back up. So that Cogent piece was actually fairly strong, where there were a number of outages that helped lift is back up. 40:33 I would say that the other part, the unplanned outages for our regular customers, that was fairly significant too. So I mean, all in all, it's probably about what we were expecting but a little bit higher. And as we sort of go through the balance of the year, and I showed you the statistics on one of the slides or some of our key industries, we do expect them to continue to run at high utilization rates. Aside from planned or unplanned outages, they're going to try and trim those off as much as they can to run as hard as they can, given the current commodity environment. 41:10 And I will also say LNG wasn't on that page, but LNG utilization rates are extremely high as well. So I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about other...\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Roderick West: 41:22 I was only going to elaborate on the LNG piece, and I'm not going to, Leo's point, give any pouch lines around Analyst Day because we'll give our point of view on our five-year outlook. But we are seeing greater interest in signing offtake contracts, which would support our view on expansion in the LNG space. We'll leave it to our customers to lead that conversation, but we'll note empirically that 85% of the projects are under FID consideration in the LNG space are in Entergy service territory. And so it just further supports our point of view that we have a unique growth story that is our customers have a unique growth story. And our ability to serve their expansions in addition to their -- helping them meet their ESG objectives remains a growth opportunity for us for us, and we still remain bullish about it.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:29 Excellent. And then just one other nuance here. I'm just seeing a lot of headlines here on insurance costs. I'm sure you guys have seen the headlines in Florida, but also in Louisiana itself, especially as it relates to catastrophic storms. Can you comment about any potential pressures from an inflationary perspective on your business specifics?\\nLeo Denault: 42:49 You're talking about insurance specifically, Julien?\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:51 Yeah. I mean I was thinking about insurance specifically, obviously, a broader backdrop here, but insurance seems to be getting headlines here outside of the utility space of very late.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Leo Denault: 43:05 Okay. So I'll -- now insurance is -- we aren't allowed to ensure our poles and wires. So that hasn't been a driver on that particular space. Just like everybody else, we have seen broad insurance premium pressure. And so we are working through that regardless of whether it's property or general liability or what have you, et cetera. So we are cyber. We're working through that and making sure that we continue to meet our overall O&M expectations on a go-forward basis. But that's, as you said, it's sort of symptomatic of a broader perspective around inflation. We certainly have seen inflation in the fuel space. We've talked about that a little bit. We are working with our stakeholders on how to manage that in the near term. I think long term, that is a commodity which cycles, and we expect the wildcatter spirit that's out there and the oil patch to take over at some point and help bring prices back down again. 44:13 As far as sort of inflation in the capital space, we talked about that a little bit with solar, we're seeing it in other materials and some of our other capital projects. But I think the thing to keep in mind on that is, we're seeing it for our current marginal capital projects, but they're being added to a much larger rate base, which is already invested in and fixed. And so it's a much smaller piece of the overall rate base when you added in. And so the pressure from a customer bill perspective is not that great. Certainly, as I mentioned, the fuel piece is something we're paying close attention to. And as far as just other operating costs, we haven't seen much pressure as of late. But we're certainly mindful of that, and we are driving our continuous improvement efforts to make sure that we stay ahead of that on an ongoing basis.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\\nSteve Fleishman: 45:32 Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just on the resilience plans that you have talked about. I think going back to last year, you talked about kind of having discussions with key stakeholders and the like. And just -- can you give any sense of how those have gone? And is there any -- do you get a sense of urgency from people on this?

And we're in that evaluation phase of the CapEx investment scenarios. And so what you're alluding to is the beginning of the formal and sometimes informal technical and stakeholder conferences and conversation. That actually begins in earnest tomorrow as we begin the conversation in New Orleans. And so the feedback loop is just beginning, and we'll have more color around it at Analyst Day. I can tell you that we have certainly had informal conversations as we were beginning the analytics. And there's a keen interest in understanding, one, what's our point of view around the risk and the benefits of acceleration. Obviously, in the current economic environment, most of the stakeholders, customers and regulators and others alike are always going to be interested in how we think through the cost and bill impact. 47:29 And so we're beginning, but I'm expecting a very active engagement from the stakeholders as we move through New Orleans. Certainly, Louisiana in route to what we believe to be our first formal filings in that July time frame for the City of New Orleans. And then the state of Louisiana certainly around that time frame, but not just likely later. Even in Texas, Steve, we have -- we've begun dropping ideas around how they ought to think about resiliency. They -- certainly, their point of view might be a little different in terms of the sense of urgency that you alluded to than say, Louisiana and New Orleans. But we certainly have their attention, especially given the role of our Texas service territory in the industrial growth space. And their interest in resiliency as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your question please.\\nJonathan Arnold: 49:08 Good morning, guys. One question, just -- can you give us a little bit of a sense, you've alluded to being conscious of commodity and gas prices and obviously, take your points about the longer-term benefits of some of your investment plans. But what is the sort of current build trajectory that you see over the coming months? And maybe we could just sort of focus in on that.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 49:41 Sure. This is Drew. So in the near term, of course, it depends on the jurisdiction. The one that you're probably most interested in, of course, is Louisiana and the securitization costs associated with that. It will depend on what the final pricing is of those securitization bonds, but somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% once all those securitization costs are into bills. And I think that includes a little bit of uptick in the interest rates that we see. So obviously, our customers are expecting that. They know it's out there. So we're managing through that with our stakeholders. And the bulk of that has already been approved by the commission. And so it's headed forward as we've discussed. 50:36 The gas price piece -- that reflects -- it depends on the jurisdiction, but it generally gets into bills fairly quickly in Louisiana, Texas, New Orleans. There is a little bit of hedging that goes on in Mississippi and Louisiana can help that, but it's pretty small. But they're used to the gas price volatility. Nevertheless, we're continuing to work through it, the continuous improvement program that we have as part of that. We also have levelized billing programs for customers that allow them to manage through their bill and avoid some of that volatility. So those are examples of things that we're doing to try to help customers go through that. And then over time, I think gas prices are a little bit above where our previous expectations were, but they're still in a manageable range. And as we said and as you were alluding to, Jonathan, the investments that we intend to make should help with gas price risk and inflation risk on a longer-term basis.\\nJonathan Arnold: 51:51 When you say over time, Drew, you're talking about sort of further out on the curve, right? Can you frame for us what the sort of 2022 impact on sort of top of the securitization might end up being on Louisiana customers, for example?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 52:08 On 2022, yeah, it's going to be a portion of what I was explaining earlier because it's not always the overall securitization costs. So maybe about two-thirds of that. So about a 5% or 6% increase by the -- once those get into the bills this year -- later this year.\\nJonathan Arnold: 52:30 And then I think the commodity piece is incremental to that? Or is that included in that number? I guess my...\\nAndrew Marsh: 52:36 No. The commodity piece -- you're talking about gas prices? Yes. I think a general rule of thumb around there is about $1 per MMBtu is about a 3% to 4% increase in gas prices, if that's sustained over a year. Of course, we haven't seen that yet, but that would be kind of the thought there.\\nJonathan Arnold: 53:00 Okay. Thank you for that color. If I could just on one other thing. When I look at your slide with the progress against guidance in the few buckets like utility O&M and the interest line and then also this is parent line that's now there. It seems like you're tracking -- you've had more than a quarter's worth of the pressure you were expecting from the year in first quarter. I know that other taxes piece, you said would be kind of more front-end loaded. But is that timing across the board? Or are these some things that are building, but then you hope that kind of the sales uptick is going to hold your homeless effective? I was just curious if you can frame that a bit for us.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 53:44 Yeah. Sure. So in terms of O&M, I think in the first quarter, you're talking to the timing elements. We are on track for our expectations for the balance of the year. And in terms of the interest expense element, we are seeing some interest expense that's a little bit higher than we would expect to stick as we go through the course of the year. But there's also some timing elements in that sort of category that we are seeing in the first quarter that will turn back around. So you're not seeing all of the interest expense in the first quarter and it goes away. It actually is going to be building over the balance of the year, but there are some timing elements in the first quarter that will turn around. But I think those are the two things that are going on.\\nJonathan Arnold: 54:30 Thank you for that. Thanks. Good luck. Look forward to [indiscernible].\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:32 All right.

Good morning, everyone.\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:44 Good morning, James.\\nJames Thalacker: 54:47 Just a real quick clarification just post Julien's question. With a slightly better sales outlook you guys have, have the drivers related to mix changed materially, Ergo? Is this really being driven more by a more robust C&I sales? Or are you seeing higher demand across all classes despite an increasing trend for return to work at this point?\\nRoderick West: 55:11 This is Rod. I think the short answer is it's been actually going the way that we expected. With residential demand trailing off as our residential customers are going back to work, school and kind of a pre-COVID life. And the growth story being driven by the C&I space that you alluded to. So from our vantage point, we're actually tracking according to plan there with a little bit of robustness in the C&I space, but that's about it.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"James Thalacker: 55:52 Okay. Great. And just following up on Jonathan's question too, just to clarify, the 10% increase you're talking about, that's in -- that's 10% increase across total retail sales, correct, in Louisiana?\\nRoderick West: 56:08 Yes.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:10 Is there somewhat of a skew across -- from a rate design basis like, is there a rough idea of like what that could mean for residential versus commercial versus industrial? Might be a little too granular at this point. I can follow up offline.\\nAndrew Marsh: 56:27 Yeah. I think Bill can cover that for you offline because I don't -- I can't actually answer that off the top of my head. There is a difference, of course. There's a big chunk of distribution costs and that is going to go mostly to residential and commercial customers, not as much on industrial customers.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:45 Okay. Great. I’ll follow up with Bill. Thanks so much.\\nOperator: 56:50 Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your question please.\\nRoss Fowler: 56:57 Good morning. How are you? So if I think about your base capital plan at $12 billion. And I think if I remember correctly from -- we're talking about $5 billion to $15 billion of potential incremental CapEx. I just wanted to understand or comment around federal funding. Is that $5 billion or $15 billion of incremental CapEx sort of net of that number or would any federal funding net that number down, whatever that number happens to be depending on the long-term opportunity set?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Andrew Marsh: 57:32 Yes. The federal funding would be outside of anything that we've got in our projections. So the $5 billion to $15 billion, that isn't over the next three years, that goes out through 2030. Just to be clear on that. And it's really an acceleration of work that we could do over time based on the fact that we might take things that are working today, but are old standard and pull them down and put up something of a new standard. It's that kind of work that we'd be looking at. So any kind of federal funding would be used to offset the cost. And then that provides headroom that you could potentially accelerate more. 58:16 So one way to think about it, Ross, would be if you were going to spend $10 billion, and then all of a sudden, you got $1 billion worth of federal funding, we may spend $11 million, would be one option to be able to -- and you get it for effectively $11 billion worth of resilience for $10 billion number. So that's the way we would think about it and likely propose it.\\nRoss Fowler: 58:40 Okay. That's the way I understood it. I just want to make sure I was understanding that correctly. And then maybe longer-term, as you get to the credit metrics you need on the balance sheet you want on the balance sheet. If you think about your 5% to 7% EPS growth. As you execute some of these opportunities and maybe grow rate base faster than that in the long term, but there might be an equity need attached to the capital. So does that bring your EPS growth rate back down. What -- how do you think about rates on bills and your long-term growth rate? In other words, is the $5 billion to $15 billion thinking about extending that 5% to 7% or maybe even the upper end of that 5% to 7% for a longer period of time? Or is there actually an opportunity to accelerate that 5% to 7% longer term given bill pressure and other things that might happen with inflation?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Leo Denault: 59:33 Yeah. I guess I'll kind of sum it up this way. We have a significant amount of growth opportunities because of the growth needs of our customers. The resilience spend is certainly one of those areas. The acceleration of renewables ahead of the schedule that we're on to meet decarbonization goals of our current customers as they want to get outsized access to clean resources could accelerate renewables at the same loan growth. The expansion of our industrial base is a growth opportunity, just the growth that we're seeing, as we've talked about, the utilization rates are high, inventories are low, all the commodity spreads are in the right place. That leaves itself pretty ripe for expansion. And that's what we're seeing as we have dialogue with our customers going forward. 60:31 And then the electrification side of things where they're going to take existing load or existing processes that are not electrified and electrify them, and that creates load growth. So there's all kinds of avenues for growth in customer demand for a higher level or a different level of service that could provide capital opportunities for us. I would say at a minimum, that just makes the runway pretty long for us in terms of where we are with the current outlook. Our objective would certainly be to have a better outlook going forward and balance all the things that you were talking about. The growth in sales, the growth in investment, and the growth in financing needs and balance all that out in a way that creates a different trajectory for us going forward. 61:18 And I think our customers are going to demand the types of investments we need to make that happen. But that's in the future. So I think all of those combined certainly bode well for a continuation of the growth that we've seen and demonstrated over the course of the last several years, pretty much like clockwork. And then I think our objective and the work we need to do is to find a way to make it better.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ETR', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ETR'}),\n",

And thank you very much for the opportunity to engage with you, again and for first having to thank you for our interim results for the period. It's also a pleasure and I think the feedback we get for this platform is very valuable. So myself and Lewanne Carminati CFO will be taking you through the key aspects of our results in this presentation, and hopefully have some time for Q&A afterwards. 1:12 So let me just jump straight into the overview of the financial year or the year. I think, first of all, from a production perspective, we were 11% down on the ounces on the corresponding period. But I think it's important to note that, we still had a solid production performance and the factors that contributed to the level production are basically isolated to two incidents, so the first one being the temporary production suspension at Lesedi. We announced just after our financial year, last year, and then subsequent water shortages and then secondly, the lower PGM Feed grades of open costs raw material we receiving at the point of operation particular and that affects both the PGM Feed grades and recovery efficiencies. So those two explain basically the production deterioration and I will cover that a bit more in detail a bit more later. 2:12 Important want to notice that the PGM Feed Tons a 17% down on the corresponding period is primarily because of the Lesedi county just lost to all the other operations met or exceeded their production performance for the period. So as I said, overall, quite encouraging that they managed to mitigate a lot of the impact. From the financial perspective, obviously, as we've seen in the last financial year, we are quite heavily impacted by the movements in the PGM price. And in this instance, with a PGM also process deteriorated is 7% period and period. The combined to the lower PGM production, my fortune revenues and profits were quite a bit lower. Nevertheless, it was still a solid performance\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"fortune revenues and profits were quite a bit lower. Nevertheless, it was still a solid performance generating still good cash and profits. And that enabled us to be able to stall the clear windfall dividend for the period of 2.25p that we would aim to pay in April. That's following on from 4p and your dividends were paid in December and also 3.75p we've paid in April last year. 3:21 So last one on the slide, which we will cover in more detail later in the presentation is obviously the group cash cost being up quite a bit in the remaining area of focus. And because of our large, fixed costs portion of our costs and the answers being down, our cash costs are quite a bit higher, and remain the focus here. And we'll deal a bit more of it later in the presentation. 3:49 I think a lot of people are familiar with location of operations, this just gives us the brief overview for anybody who's new on the – on our company, that they are to pause our presentation, you'll see like in the project when we talk about projects and growth as well. We primarily have six Chrome, beneficiation and PGM plants – processing implants that are located on the Eastern Western Limb of this African bushveld complex respectively. And that's the those are the operations currently generating all our revenue and profits. 4:25 And then secondly, to the top of the picture there in the middle North is the to mining right areas that we have, or a number of mining right here is the one is the Grasevally Chrome Mining project that is within announced in recent announcements that is a sale that's in progress. And then the other two is the Northern Limb and Volspruit projects, which we'll deal with later in the presentation. 4:54 Looking at the production profiles, and I've mentioned earlier that, we fundamentally this year saw their production – and the lower production primarily because of the impact of the Lesedi and I'm wondering you can see the yellow and blue bars being smaller for 2022.

We are ever looking at commissioning the Lesedi MF2 later and we will during the day towards the end of this quarter, to ramp up and stabilize during Q4. And we are looking at commissioning Tweefontein to later in this calendar year. So in the first half of the new financial year, and those 2 projects will help to ramp our profile up again, combined with us addressing the water issues and Lesedi, which I'll deal with in the next slide just now. I think also just worth noting on this little split is we show the these are 4E answers we're dealing with. And you saw our 4E Prill Split there on the side. But I have also just put a little table in on the slide that compares it to 6E. And you can see for instance for this period, the 32,400 ounces equates to about 41,860 ounces. And the only reason we doing that is for you to get an idea some of our peers and other companies in the industry announced only 6E ounces and then you can see what the ratio of the 2E is. 6:25 So if we look at more detail around the Lesedi problem and as I said with announced early last year, okay. After our financial again to the problems we've had, we've managed to successfully implement a number of mitigating measures that helped us to reinstate integrity of the dam to the current state where it's not a concern all the parameters are falling within our acceptable design and operating parameters. We have our ever from a production point of view incurred longer downtime than anticipated and the primary reason for that is when we started remining and recommissioning feed to the operation. At the end of September last year, we've had significant water shortages and also because we depositing on a temporary emergency tailings in the deposition facility, our return water rates, the recovery rates were lower than normal. And therefore it exacerbated the water problem and we had significant production\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",

It's been in construction during the last year and you can see the bottom right picture there. It's a state of the art tailings facility with suitable storage return-water dam [Indiscernible] water-dam facilities that will be able to manage the water a lot more efficiently going forward. 8:03 So overall, we believe that we will see Lesedi coming back to more sustainable production and from Q4 obviously in this current quarter January and February still partially impacted taking into account in our forecast for the year. When we look at the other two areas of focus last at the moment, the lower on grades and as I explained in previous announcements since our host mine scaled down some of the underground operations in early 2020. We have seen quite a reduction in PGM Feed Grade to our main way operation in particular, with PGM Feed 30% to 40%, lower. And various sampling campaigns investigations has been performed during the period to try and address that to those months. Obviously, the current mine is don't do PGM grade control at all, the primary current mine is because it's not the business and we from Sylvania point of view and our relationship with those mines employ external geologists, the mining engineers, specifically the focus on the PGM grade occurrence on the various sources, so that we can work with those found to try and improve the blending ratio to our operation. And we anticipate an improvement in the feed grades to come. 9:26 The last one at the bottom of the slide is water constraints and operations and it ties into what I've just discussed on the Lesedi.

But water generally in areas of the program, and we've also received on the piece of might have questions for investing meet quite a few questions relating to water. So I think it's worth maybe just looking at that what we're doing. They are various initiatives we have implemented since 2019 and that was really the first year where we had significant downtime between Mooinooi and Lesedi. We've had significant additional [Indiscernible] recover water around our own properties. We've also very innovative plan that employed a company called water enters to scavenge and reduce seepage water from around the perimeter of the tailings dams that added significantly to our water supply and helped us to balance the water better. And then finally, as I said, looking at better return-water facilities surround our designs in the new building facilities. We also continue to engage with our host minds with neighbouring minds with water specialist in the area to not only look on our own properties, but also conducting water studies, underground water surveys are now surrounds and there's a couple of projects that could potentially improve the long-term situation of water. So I think if it wasn't for the tailings dam issues at Lesedi, the impact would not have been so pronounced. But it is still a focus area for us in terms of long-term security. 11:01 From opportunity perspective, obviously we've – we quite happy that we are able to commission our Lesedi bond soon the MF2 which is the secondary milling and flotation MF2 as you would remember, this secondary billing and flotation. blonds is outflow from the very successful rollout of our Project ECHO or that we have rolled out MF2 plants to [Indiscernible] respectively, and which have been running very successfully for a number of years now.

Obviously, the existing ones we have is some smaller few sources to the tune of 2,000 ounces to 3,000 ounces a year we can add that's associated with some of our eastern operations. But then we also have various sampling campaigns where we continue to engage with the bodies to bring in secure more material online. 12:22 Fine chrome recovery is again, it's a project we've defined in terms of Unlocking Potential in otherwise sterilized resources with a PGM grade is too low in some of our old dumps. So instead of walking away from those dumps, because the PGM grade is low, there's lots of significant Chrome and there is a mutually beneficial business case for us and those mines to recover that Chrome and once you recover the significant amount of Fine Chrome you also upgrade the PGM to a stage where it is worth picking it another time for your operation. So therefore extending life of mine and we continue to focus on those projects. Lenox in particular is an example where this would work very well. 13:04 And then just finally, we manage to maintain a strong cash reserves and we continuously balance our existing capital projects to stay in business and interim expansion versus the need for future projects, looking at creating value for shareholders and the different instruments, and also then it gives us the advantage of having cash available in the event of opportunistic M&A. 13:34 So I'm gonna end over to Lewanne, just to take us through the financials and then we'll do a bit more some of the projects that the inbound the market and I'll do the details for us afterwards.

I'll go into the revenue a little more detail in the next slide. Cost of sales includes both direct and indirect costs of production, plus non-cash items, such as your depreciation, whichever has payments and we had provision movements. We've split out the Mineral Royalty Tax on the base of the statements given the increase in Royalty Attracting ounces, resulting in a much higher cost is typically disclosed. And then other expenses are [Indiscernible] G&A in South Africa, Mauritius, Bermuda and the UK and then a portion of that is also realized for its adjustments on revenue. 14:56 Lastly on this slide, is the income tax expense, which includes income tax that's payable on profits in South Africa at 28% deferred tax movements dividend withholding tax, which is declared on dividends declared by the South African operating entity upwards to the parent entity. And this brings us to a net profit of $24 million balance for the period. 15:26 Looking at revenue and net revenue is down 19% on the comparative prior period. The lower Basket price accounted for a decrease of $6.6 million and the lower ounce production a decrease of $9.3 million.

Platinum contributed 23% of revenue, which equates to about $15 million. Platinum 20%, Palladium 15%, which is about $10 million, and rhodium at 56% of our revenue at the $9 million.

A portion of this increase is due to the strengthening of the average rent dollar by 7% [Indiscernible]. So if you look at the cost in Rand terms, our cash was increased 23% with the main contributors being that 15% increase in electricity mining costs that were higher due to the subsidy paid to the host mine and as we said at year end results presentation was on a trial basis and has subsequently stopped so that that cost will be reduced. 17:16 We had higher consumable costs which are incurred as a result of more wrong material at the Lenox bronze. annual payroll increases were effective in July 2021 and then we had to higher maintenance costs as a result of course a material feed being processed to some of the clients.

I think very briefly, just a recap on the Prill Splits we've had earlier in the presentation as well. But it puts in perspective, when you look at the price trend at the bottom, we have the big increase, especially Erodium. That purple line in the bottom of the graph increased about mid last year, and then the sharp decline they after. But fortunately, we have started seeing uptick again since early this year. And I'll explain that a bit more in terms of the fundamentals on the next slide. But just you know you can see our Odium is 56% of our revenue for the past year. Our impact on the price of rhodium because we are pro is a good splits. So when it was all going well, and rhodium is up it's all positive and when rhodium is declining. It does have a negative side to results. 27:56 So when we look at a market and where we think the price will go I think it's important to understand in the metals that we deal with in the form a significant part of our basket. What drives that I think palladium and rhodium in very much getting together with the auto catalysts sales rates a significant portion 83% and 91% or setback roughly on the demand. And that was heavily impacted during the past year with a slowdown in internal combustion vehicle sales that was impacted by the global chip shortage. But we have seen as the sales are starting to improve and also forecast to improve significantly during the year, we have seen recovery starting in these metals and with analysts forecasting these metals to remain in deficit. For the short to medium term, we're quite positive that we should still experience robust process on palladium rhodium and some yes, we fully aware that battery electric vehicles are a threat to the internal combustion engine that [Indiscernible]. 29:07 But, you have to also look structurally at the capacity\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",

And we've seen very sharp increases already and those are factors that might slow down the battery electric vehicle rollout, they will list as I said, for the short-to-medium term, we're quite confident in the palladium and rhodium market. The Platinum on the other side of being in surplus at the price was more under pressure in recent years, however, with Platinum’s role in both us and industrial, chemical applications, and also the opportunity where some suppliers are looking at substitution from palladium to platinum in some more tickets. That is the demand for platinum we're looking for going forward is forecast to increase and I think, analysts vary slightly in the forecast. But between 5 and 7 years, we expect the Palladium price – the platinum price to increase more platinum plays quite a big role in the hydrogen economy in the sense of hydrogen catalysts, both in industrial catalysts and also in fuel cell vehicles. 30:31 So we'll keep our eye on that. And I think just when you look at some of the prices, we've heard from a few institutions, I think this first one the platinum and Standard Bank – Standard Bank corporate banks forecasts in terms of platinum, especially the long-term increasing is in line with that expected demand increase and Olbermann netbank have a more stable outlook. And then palladium and rhodium, you can see both have a declining profile, but still significantly higher than historic levels. While gold is quite flat, and but it's a minor portion, there's not 1% in our overall basket. 31:12 So in general, I think we were the process is at the moment, we don't anticipate the process necessarily to go back to where we've seen them in the first half of last calendar\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",

And we do that in the sense of creating positive – generate positive guests and returning value to the shareholders both by means of dividends. And we've done both NL and windfall dividends, and also regular share buybacks. And also by not going back to the market to ask for money to fund our growth projects. We haven't had the need to raise any capital in the market since 2009 and all our growth up to now has been funded from internal cash resources completely. So we want to maintain and continue with an annual stable sustainable annual dividend and a progressive dividend. For shareholders, we continue to generate cash there and then as we've done with this particular windfall, we have higher than anticipated metal prices, compared to consensus values for a period, we would look at sharing, again, additional money with our shareholders. And then obviously, you know, since 2015, we've had almost 50 million – 49 million shares that we bought back of which we cancelled nearly 13 million shares, retained by the shareholder so that's a philosophy that we will continue to do, obviously, in order to maintain flows back to our shareholders. We have to ensure that we continue generating profits and that we have a sustainable business going forward. And we do that in three ways. Firstly, with the normal R&D and press optimization initiatives where we focus on our existing operations, making them more efficient, and doing certain modifications employing new technology so that we can get more out of them and I think there's only two that is the way we've since about 2014, or the same number of operations managed to increase our rounds profile,\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",

Also, the fine chrome opportunity I've spoken about this is something that can follow in the short term approach, and then also feeding dump source into existing operations. 34:03 If you look more longer-term, and in terms of expanding capacity and creating longer life of mine, we've been over the years engaging with a number of third parties in the industry, to look at adding resources to our program and we are confident that both from the eastern and western levels respectively, that we're able to add those resources in the timeframe suggested that could add between 10,000 ounces and 20,000 ounces a year each. If we progress them, and we've currently busy with investigations on them, and if anyone on specific commercial terms will decide on how we roll out and what form it will take in terms of both funding from capital, we do have I've given them because the figure of say between $20 million and $25 million is what we expect on each of these projects, to bring them to commissioning. And, with our current cash generation forecasts that on cash reserves, we should be able to fund our projects and maintain a stable dividend. When we look longer-term, and probably deviating slightly from the current dump and current earnings business is the longer-term inspiration projects, that those are two mineral projects for which we own the mining rights – approved mining rights or they have been granted and that is purchased up in the northern limb.

So we stating the resource statement so that we can produce a higher grade concentrate that saleable to existing smelters and refineries, without us to having incur the cost and risk of own internal either metallurgical in Parliament political infrastructure and that's what we're looking at these projects. Obviously, from a timeline perspective, you would remember, I've announced earlier, when we launched the specialist studies on Prill Split and the northern Prill Split study outcomes we expected expecting during the next 6 months, we should be able to restate the resources and reserve to acceptable limits that we are able to make a decision on how we want to progress with the project. 36:44 The Northern Limb entailed some additional drilling, and those drilling work has been concluded at the end of December.

And then we will also hopefully, by year end of geological results to share and then a couple of months later, we will be able to have the money models run on that as well. 37:13 These projects, I think it's important to stress that, looking at the capital requirement to them and also the size is we – as a board will make a decision once we have the feedback on the studies and the results per se.

It is shallow resources as I said they are open but of all they can be opencast mining so the near surface and the philosophy change we made is that we can produce grants that are sellable to the current market.

Ladies and gentlemen, please do continue to submit your questions using the Q&A tab. It's just situates on the right hand corner of your screen. But just while the company take a few moments to review those questions already submitted, I'd like to remind you the recording of this presentation along with a copy of the slides and the published Q&A can be accessed by your investor dashboard. Jaco and Lewanne, we've received a number of pre-submitted questions from investors. And I wanted to start off the Q&A session with these.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 40:45 The first one I believe you touched on in the presentation. But maybe if you could write a bit more color, will the management team be looking at share buybacks moving forward?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 40:56 Yes, thank you, Jake (ph). No, as I said, it is a key consideration for us. And when we look at the current best cash position and capital requirements, we have agreed to make a sizable amount available for share buybacks in the near future, we'll always approach them on opportunity basis, we believe we can add value to shareholders. So that's something we will continue, and the board is committed to doing. And I think also positive in that regard is taking the balance of shares currently in Treasury that have to you need for employee share schemes and remuneration going forward. We don't need to buy any shares back for that, if initially as we would buy back in future would be canceled, and therefore add value.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 41:46 Thank you. The second question that we received pre submitted was, are any of the planned work overs or developments on unexploited assets expected to make any significant improvement to ounces produced? Or are these works just expected to keep us near current output?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Lewanne Carminati: 42:03 Yeah, look, I think that's important one, and I, without us having to have the exact apart from that project pipeline, the idea is that it's not just sustaining current level, we you have inflationary cross bridges over the time and if you're going to stay at the same production levels or declining production levels, you will erode your margins going forward. So the key is always to say, Listen, how do we grow the business more, and I think we've always had a growth plan. And in this last two years, it was unfortunate significantly hampered firstly, by COVID and then by the host mine cut back, otherwise, we would have seen the growth on our profiles, but we're also looking at a more significant growth going forward and into the projects that we're looking to add on the profile. So I think, when we shared profile earlier, we were looking at between 60,000 ounces and 70,000 ounces for about 7 to 10 years. We're after as most of our primary dump sources are curating your life anymore on current devices and dump it probably would have tapered down to say 40,000 ounces to 50,000 ounces, adding additional plants to the tune of 15 or 10,000 ounces to 20,000 ounces on Eastern Western and respectively, you suddenly move your margin to stay over, say about 100,000 ounces and then even longer-term, you can add the expression of projects if we decide to continue then even on top of that, so certainly the idea is to grow the profile rather than just maintaining the profile and replacing existing production. So, I hope that answered the question.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 43:39 That's great. The final pre submitted question that we have here reads as follows. The Global Automakers the signaling a massive ramp up in production this year, hopefully, basket price will be robust as a result, how can Sylvania take advantage of this could output be increased temporarily to build stocks and position to sell into high into high basket price?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Jaco Prinsloo: 44:00 Look, so that is, unfortunately, the flexibility is not that great? That way, suddenly, we can change our production plans to suit the market. The Prill Splits and others ratio of the platinum palladium rhodium in our orders are quite consistent and constant. So this unfortunate opportunity for us to do that, what we can do in what we continuously do is to evaluate, we often get approached by third parties to say, they have higher grade material, maybe from operations, whether the treatment facilities and can you treat it. And if we have an operation, for instance, we currently treating a low grade dump material, and you're able to substitute their feed with a higher grade material and then the incremental value we generate makes sense for both parties. Certainly, those are things we continuously evaluate and from our own mining perspectives, we can look at our own resources and CIP, we can optimize rates. But unfortunately, it's not huge flexibility in that regard. But it remains a consideration in how we approach our food sources and their business plans.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:09 That's great. Thank you so much for that, if I may, could I please ask you to open up that Q&A tab, which is on the right hand corner of your screen. As you can see, we received a number of questions throughout today's presentation and thank you once again, to all investors for submitting those questions. If I could please ask you to read out the questions and give response where it's appropriate to do so. And I'll pick up from you at the end.

       " Document(page_content=\"Unidentified Company Representative: 45:32 Okay, so I'm looking at one of the things, but I think maybe while I was talking, I don't know if it's been answered. So there was a question from David, say, you say you are using excess cash to buy back shares, or the shares being cancelled or held in Treasury and buybacks that to be to be having a positive impact on the share price. And I think I have indicated that, you know, we have sufficient trades and priority to fulfill the needs of our share schemes. So obviously, we would be looking at cancelling them and I know there's been a big debate of does the cancelling add value or not, we certainly have a number of our institutions shell as I said, they prefer the buyback over the dividends, this other search engines prefer the dividend. And we always try to maintain a balance. And that's also I would say, it's also just to have opportunistic approach to it and see, when in the spells, we'll be dealing with a lower share price that we do the buyback thing. And sometimes shareholders perceive it as not having any impact, but you put it well, at the share price declining further divide, that's not happened. So again that answer to the question from David.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 46:46 That was, David, if on the screen I see this a next question from David [Indiscernible] I'm not sure if the same David or another one. And he asked, and you can probably along the similar lines, can you comment on the poor valuation of the share price and why this is what I believe is a he said earnings of only for?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Lewanne Carminati: 47:05 And I think these leaning shoulders that raised their frustration about the valuation of the share price in recent years. And I mean, that's something we also try to work on, unfortunately, conflict roller, the share price, it's based on, on how the market perceive the value. But what I do think is, once you're able to have more tangible resources, I mean, we believe that the growth is there. But for analysts and investors to make proper long-term forecast, it always helps to have proper reserves and resources available. So there's a timeline is a clear indication of how much you have and for how long it will last, and I'm – I'm hoping that even next in this next year, we will be able to bring a lot more of that to the table whereas we update our resources on our exploration projects, we can do it the third part is re-engaging with approved the resource and reserve statements of that work and I think that will help shield us to ever a clear line of sight in terms of what our business is based on. It's always been difficult with our current arrangement of those mines, where you operate, to show you a commercial, confidential commercial agreement. And it's a private list of companies so they don't disclose any of their operations. And I believe that might be a big impact on why we're not seeing the valuation as strong as it could be, and understandably so. But I do think the situation that should improve going forward.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 48:42 I think this, the next question I see is from Michael D. He says, are you continuing to experience cost pressures in the business?\", metadata={'quarter': 2, 'symbol': 'SAPLF', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q2SAPLF'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Lewanne Carminati: 48:50 Look, obviously, I mentioned first one for us is the fact that we have a large, fixed cost portion. So obviously, when the answers are down, we are under pressure, there's our unit costs to hire from the external points. Yes, we've had recently a 15% increase in electricity. We have, our global national utility have asked or applied for a 20% increase rate for the next financial year and that's currently still have to be approved by the authorities. I think, a lot of the local analysts believe that they probably wouldn't be approved. But in any case, the electricity has been higher than standard inflation, the last few years. So electricity always remain a cost pressure. We fortunate enough that from a labor perspective, our labor portion is lower than typical conventional underground mines and we've been since we started the company, I've been able to always conclude wage negotiations on a reasonable industry related values. And so labor have also been in fine. I think on the projects, we see a bet on post [Indiscernible] supply of steel in electronics, and those kind of things a bit more of increase in prices. But from those normal running operations, the highest cost project is probably electricity demand. Thank God, if I look at my drop down screen, that's probably the…\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 50:35 Yes, I was just gonna say thank you for addressing all those questions that you can from investors today. And, of course, ladies and gentlemen, the company will have the opportunity to provide answers to any further questions where they believe it is appropriate to do so.

So thank you very much, then I think, looking over the results for the passport, although it's a robust set of results. These definitely room for improvement. And I hope that we have given the shell this assurance that we know exactly where the areas are and that we are putting adequate and sufficient plans in place to address them.

Since our last call, public health authorities in our region did report a peak in COVID cases from mid to late August and now been reporting substantial declines over the last eight weeks. We continue to see few restrictions on business activity in our primary markets and our operations have been much less impacted since our prior call. 01:42 We again remain positive about our credit profile and borrower performance. We continue to see limited number of relationships operating under modified terms under the CARES Act. We have four loans continuing under interest only modifications and are to borrowers in the hotel industry and totaled just under twenty four million dollars. We continue to analyze this portfolio closely and we have continued to see improvement by most of these customers. 02:13 PPP forgiveness continued in the September quarter. The release notes that we received almost thirty seven million dollars in PPP forgiveness during the September quarter, down slightly from the prior two months -- two quarters and twenty six million dollars in PPP loans remain outstanding. Accelerated fee recognition picked up some in the September quarter as the average fee was higher on second round loans that made up a larger percentage of those loans forgiven. As of September thirty, eighty seven percent of our PPP loans originated in both rounds one and two had been forgiven. 02:56 Our non-performing loans were slightly higher this quarter, up about three hundred thousand, but offsetting that was our adversely classified loans were slightly lower down from the prior quarter by one million dollars to seventeen point one million dollars, a year ago, they were twenty five million dollars.

These combined categories were at thirty nine point three million dollars at September thirty down from forty eight point four million dollars at June thirty and fifty point nine million dollars a year ago. 03:59 For agricultural update, ag production and other loans to farmers were up almost twenty two million dollars in the quarter and up five million dollars compared to this same period of last year. While ag real estate balances were up about five million dollars over the quarter and three million dollars compared to the September thirty of last year. Our agricultural borrowers are in the middle of harvest season and lenders node average to higher yields in their fall progress performance. 04:30 Our corn harvest is mostly complete and yielding one hundred and seventy five to two hundred bushel an acre for non-irrigated ground, and in the two fifty bushels an acre per irrigated ground.

       " Document(page_content=\"Matthew Funke: 06:45 Okay, Great. We earned a one point four three dollars diluted in the September quarter. September is the first quarter of our fiscal year. And that resulted down zero point one zero dollars from the linked June quarter, but up zero point three four dollars from the one point nine dollars that we earned in the September twenty twenty quarter. A year ago, we had a charge to earnings for our provision for credit losses as compared to a modest recovery with a negative provision in the current period, although, it's down from a larger negative provision in the linked June quarter. 07:17 Our net interest margin in the September quarter was four point zero one percent which is about, which included about six basis points of contribution from fair value discount accretion on acquired loan books or three hundred and seventy six thousand dollars in dollar terms. Also as forgiveness of PPP loans continued, we accelerated the origination fee accretion on those loans adding another two point two million dollars to interest income which contributed thirty four basis points to the margins. 07:51 In the year ago period, our margin was three point seven three percent of which six basis points resulted from fair value discount creation and has three hundred and thirty nine thousand and PPP loans weren't yet in the forgiveness process at that time. So, on what we see as a core basis, our margin was down almost seven basis points comparing September twenty one to September of twenty. We see our core loan yield as declining twenty eight basis points, while our core cost of deposits was down forty seven and our core total cost of funds down a similar forty eight basis points, but higher average cash balances drove the decline in the margin reducing our total interest earning asset yield, which dropped by thirty nine basis points outside of discount accretion or accelerated recognition of PPP origination fees. 08:44 In the linked June quarter, we reported a margin of\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'SMBC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1SMBC'}),\n",

So on what we would consider of course sequential basis, we see an increase of about fourteen basis points and we would note that about a third of that improvement is due to the current ninety two day quarter as compared to the ninety one day quarter in June. 09:20 Non-interest interest income was down four hundred twenty six thousand dollars compared to the year ago period. We saw continuing declines in gains on sale of residential loans originated for that purpose and their related servicing income. Increases in deposit service charges and bank card interchange income offset some of that decline. A net gain on fixed assets of one hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars was recorded on the sale of bank properties and compared to the linked quarter deposit service charges were higher while interchange income was lower, and servicing income was lower on the inclusion in June’s results of a positive fair value adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights. 10:00 Non-interest income was up one million dollars compared to the year ago quarter, increases were mostly attributable to compensation, occupancy, data a processing and advertising. Compared to the linked quarter, non-interest expense was little changed as higher compensation and occupancy was offset by lower legal and professional charges and advertising expenses. We reported no net charge offs in the September quarter, down even from the very low net charge off figure in the June quarter.

Compared to September thirty of twenty, gross loan balances were up ninety six million dollars or four point four percent.

Overall, we're very pleased with the loan growth totals that you've mentioned, and we feel like we're off to a good start for the new fiscal year. Seasonal lag draws were helpful again this last quarter and we also retained about six million dollars of residential loans that we normally would have sold in the secondary market. 13:49 Single and multi-family residential combined for about forty one million dollars our loan growth. Commercial balances dropped on the PPP forgiveness payments and we also saw construction lines payoff. Our East region saw some of the largest PPP payments received and outside of that factor all three regions contributed strongly to loan growth led by our South region. 14:17 Our outlook for the December quarter remains quite strong as our pipeline for loans to fund in ninety days was one hundred and eighty one million dollars at September thirty. Higher than where we stood at June thirty and about fifty percent higher and at the same time last year. With ag paydowns coming, we'll see some seasonal offset for the next several quarters and we should see PPP payments continue to come in over this timeframe. 14:48 We budgeted for between four percent to five percent growth outside of PPP forgiveness in fiscal twenty twenty two, but we currently believe there's a good chance that we will exceed those figures. Our non-owner CRE concentration was approximately two hundred and seventy two percent of regulatory capital at September thirty, relatively unchanged as compared to June thirty and as compared to two hundred and sixty seven percent one year ago. 15:17 In the current quarter, our loan growth in the relevant categories in total was in line with our consolidated capital growth.

Traditionally, we do see that September quarter is our weakest for deposit growth in December and March quarters to be much stronger. So seasonal factors may offset some anticipated runoff over the next several quarters. Time deposit balances showed some signs of stabilization after four quarters or more of significant declines. Our excess reserves trended back a bit higher in October, and remain somewhat above where we would normally want to see them.

They’ve become more active at reacquiring properties, again, a lot of the pipeline has been in multi-family, a lot of low income housing tax credit projects that they're buying that they are converting to market rents.\\nAndrew Liesch: 19:30 Okay. Good to hear the loan demand there. And then obviously, some bounding round on the different non-interest income categories from quarter-to-quarter. How do you see that I mean, if you take out the gain on the sale of the former branches, how do you see that four point four million dollars total playing out? It seems like there's -- maybe service charges might be a little bit higher as it was this quarter, but how do you see interchange in gain on loan sales playing also next two quarters?\\nMatthew Funke: 20:05 I think that secondary market activity, we probably or obviously will pass the peak on that. So don't want to overestimate where we may be able to run on that.

Just wondering your approach to deploying the buyback, while the deal is currently pending, I know you have a ton of capital, but just wanted to know kind of thoughts with employing that where valuation is and with the deal is that on the table?\\nMatthew Funke: 21:38 With the pending acquisition, giving stock in that we do have to be conscious of when that proxy with solicitation period begin, as we exit from our  period, our understanding is that we can be active and we're always going to look at the relative value of acquiring that stock and what payback period is on that versus holding onto that capital for some potential future use as well.\\nKelly Motta: 22:07 Great. And then maybe if you could add a few comments on the  branch acquisition, just we'll motivated that if there's potential saves from changing your location there or just anything to kind of help us out? Thanks.\\nGreg Steffens: 22:27 On the  location, There's two banks in  First National and our facility was in need of some significant rehabilitation and they actually approached us about us acquiring their location and they have a bigger location that would more fit a consolidated operation. And then on top of that, they have close to thirty million dollars in deposits, which was very similar in size to what we have and we felt like that there's some efficiencies that can be gained by combining the two operations into one.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'SMBC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1SMBC'}),\n",

Can you remind me any seasonality you have with the start of the year and kind of have you think about that progression, clearly done a nice job getting some positive operating leverage with expense control, but just wondering kind of how to -- if you could remind me on the seasonality of expenses would be helpful? Thank you.\\nMatthew Funke: 23:44 Sure. We do generally reassess employee compensation beginning in January, that along with resetting the clock on payroll taxes, usually does cause us to pick up a bigger percentage of our annual compensation expense build there. And then like everybody we're dealing with competition for talent right now and so I would expect that compared to normal we would see maybe a little more of a build on that line item than what we have over previous years.\\nKelly Motta: 24:20 Thanks, Matt.

As always, I want to thank all of our Adaptive employees for their dedication and for their solid execution during a quarter in which we completed a reorganization of our business. 02:14 This strategic restructuring focuses Adaptive in two business areas: MRD and immune medicine. Along with our recent headcount reduction these changes will result in a more streamlined organization to fuel growth as we navigate this turbulent market. We continue to hire talent strategically in key growth areas, such as our clonoSEQ sales team and our Cell Therapy Group in South San Francisco. We also look forward to formally welcoming our new CFO, Tycho Peterson and leveraging his extensive expertise. Tycho will officially start on June 1st, following completion of his garden leave. 02:54 Reprioritized the product development efforts for each business area and the teams are in place to execute towards our 2022 goals. Slide three shows the respective key drivers of our MRD and immune medicine businesses. The value of our MRD business is a combination of the clonoSEQ test offer to clinicians and the clonoSEQ MRD assay offer to pharma partners, who integrate MRD status and they are hem malignancy trials. Aligning these synergistic components of the MRD business under the same leadership at Adaptive will drive execution and enhanced visibility. 03:35 The immune medicine business is comprised of pharma, clinical testing and drug discovery, all of which are driven or informed by our T-cell receptor antigen map. As with our MRD business within immune medicine there is a synergistic value between the utility of the information for clinical diagnostics and to pharma partners in research and drug development. 04:00 As shown on Slide four, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with revenue of $38.6 million.

       " Document(page_content='reflect a solid start to the year with revenue of $38.6 million. Both business areas delivered key achievements and are set up for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Within the MRD business clonoSEQ test volume experienced strong growth of 45% versus prior year. The clonoSEQ sales team of 70 reps is now fully hired and train and is being deployed to hit the field, progress continued with payers, data generation and guideline expansion. 04:37 For our MRD pharma, we continue to grow our partnerships. This quarter we entered into an expanded MRD pan-portfolio partnership with a major pharma partner in multiple myeloma and CLL for the use of MRD as a clinical endpoint.  in medicine business is also delivered on multiple fronts generating a total of approximately $21 million this quarter. 05:02 Revenue from pharma partners that use immunoSEQ and data generated from our TCR antigen map grew 100% versus prior year. We are well positioned for continued growth as we expand the use of immunoSEQ in multiple therapeutic areas and secure additional key map deals beyond COVID. For example, this quarter, we entered into a new collaboration with J&J to map T-cell responses to RSV for its vaccine program. The clinical diagnostic pipeline with the key detect is advancing in both infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. And in drug discovery, we continue to make good progress with our shared and private product programs under our Genentech collaboration. 05:49 Moving onto MRD business on Slide five. Test delivered grew 12% to 7,698 tests versus prior quarter with double-digit growth observed in all three indications. Ordering HCPs and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 53% and 36% respectively versus prior year and unique patients tested also grew 59%. Growth in the community setting although off a small base was north of 60% during the quarter, demonstrating a strong start by our expanded sales force focused on increasing our reach beyond academic centers.', metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",

As part of our strategy to cement their leadership in lymphoid malignancies, we plan to expand into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using ctDNA, which is the best measure of relapse risk. We have submitted our application for DLBCL coverage to MolDX this quarter. We continue to enhance the overall customer experience by investing in the integration of clonoSEQ into customer ordering systems. This integration can positively impact both order volume and order pull through. We're off to a great start and on track to accelerate our growth trajectory for the remainder of the year. 07:19 I want to share on Slide six new data about using clonoSEQ and pediatric ALL patients. In this published study 143 pediatric ALL patients receiving CAR-T were tested for MRD at multiple time points using flow and clonoSEQ. Data show that clonoSEQ detected disease in blood that flow missed in marrow. Furthermore in bone marrow, the performance of clonoSEQ was very strong. clonoSEQ detected MRD in 100% of patients prior to relapse with a median lead time of 168 days versus 52 days using flow, giving the clinician significant lead time to inform treatment decisions. I look forward to sharing additional data readouts this year, further demonstrating the increasing utility of clonoSEQ MRD testing. 08:15 As mentioned before our MRD pharma partnerships are key component of our MRD business. Slide seven shows our pharma portfolio, which is comprised of partnerships with over to 60 companies that integrate clonoSEQ in their clinical trials. As efficacy of blood cancer drugs continue to improve, pharma companies are looking for more sensitive ways to measure response.

Almost every major pharma company developing a blood cancer drug is using clonoSEQ in their trials as a clinical endpoint. 08:55 From these partnerships, we have a portfolio of more than $330 million in future eligible milestones based on additional drug approval from ongoing and future studies. We continue to grow and expand our pharma partnerships and look forward to seeing clonoSEQ data derived from these pharma trials to further drive clinical utility of the clonoSEQ test to clinicians. 09:19 Now turning to our immune medicine business on Slide eight. Immune medicine business is comprised of three growth areas: pharma; clinical testing; and drug discovery. Each of these areas has multiple shots on goal to create value in the short, medium and long-term. This value is predominantly driven by data that we generate through our TCR Antigen Map. The pharma research area, which includes over 100 companies using our immunoSEQ or T-MAP products is expected to continue to grow significantly in the short and medium term. The clinical diagnostic area or T-Detect is in the early innings with its first indication launched last year, which also served to establish T-Detect as a new class of molecular T-Cell Diagnostics. We expect T-Detect to be a more meaningful contributor to revenue in the medium to long-term, as we generate and validate T-Cell signatures in multiple autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. 10:28 And the drug discovery area, which is currently focused on our cell therapy collaboration with Genentech is in early stage of development and is expected to be a significant growth contributor in the mid to long-term. We aim to secure additional collaborations beyond cancer cell therapy that could further accelerate our growth. 10:48 Let's take a closer look on Slide nine at the immune medicine business performance this quarter.

       " Document(page_content=\"closer look on Slide nine at the immune medicine business performance this quarter. Pharma was the biggest contributor of revenue growth in the quarter and represented 30% of the immune medicine business. Our immunoSEQ T-MAP product is gaining traction with additional COVID studies and a new RSV program, which I mentioned. We expect to expand the use of existing and future T-MAPs in more disease areas as we continue to generate data from our TCR Antigen Map. As for T-Detect COVID, this quarter orders decreased versus last quarter as we are seeing the virus moved from a pandemic to an endemic state. We continue to offer the test to consumers with modest promotional activities to maintain brand awareness. 11:35 We are focusing on making T-Detect Lyme available via our CLIA lab during this Lyme season, while we accelerate data generation and signal validation and select autoimmune disorders. Drug discovery revenue is attributed to the amortization of the Genentech upfront payment, which varies quarter-over-quarter. For our shared product this year we're on track to deliver up to two additional TCR packages. We also continue to work closely with Genentech to establish the private product specifications and to build our private product data package. 12:12 Zooming into T-Detect on Slide 10. T-Detect in infectious diseases has served as a proof of our T-Detect platform further investments in COVID and Lyme indications will be pursued opportunistically. Specifically in COVID our efforts to establish the T-Cell response as a correlate of protection continue. We have been making progress at a policy level. Couple of weeks ago Adaptive alongside a group of nearly 70 leading academics industry leaders and patient advocates sent a letter to the FDA urging the incorporation of T-Cell response and COVID vaccine studies. This could further drive opportunities for T-Detect and for T-MAP COVID. We also expect to make T-Detect Lyme available in the next quarter.

By making T-Detect available in our CLIA lab, we aim to implement the processes, which will be necessary for all future indications. In parallel, the team is working on initiating a clinical validation study in IBD and continues to improve our signal in MS. Our objective is to launch at least one autoimmune indication set by the end of 2023.

       " Document(page_content=\"Kyle Piskel: 14:01 Thanks, Chad. Turning to our financial results on Slide 11. Total revenue in the first quarter was $38.6 million, representing a slight increase from $38.4 million in the same period last year. In prior periods, we've disaggregated revenue in the sequencing and development category as you can see on the left side of the slide. This quarter our revenue reporting is now disaggregated to reflect the reorganization of our business around our MRD and immune medicine market opportunities. 14:31 Immune medicine consist of revenue generated from immunoSEQ and immunoSEQ T-MAP to pharma and research customers. Our T-Detect COVID test clinical customers and our collaboration agreements in drug discovery. MRD consist of revenue generated from clonoSEQ to clinical customers and our MRD services to pharma and research partners. We have included a revenue bridge for the last eight quarters in our earnings release and 10-Q to reflect the revised revenue disaggregation. 14:58 Our revenue mix for the first quarter consisted of 54% for immune medicines, 46% from MRD. Immune medicine revenue in the first quarter was $20.8 million, a 4% increase from the same period in 2021. Growth in immune medicine was primarily driven by $3.4 million increase in revenue from our pharma and research partners, partially offset by a $3.3 million reduction in the amortization of our Genentech upfront payment. 15:25 As a reminder, these revenue amortization amounts may vary quarter-over-quarter. MRD revenue was $17.8 million in the first quarter, down 3% from the same period last year. This change was primarily due to recognizing $7 million in regulatory milestones in Q1 of 2021 versus $3 million this quarter. This reduction was partially offset by $3.6 million increase in revenue from clonoSEQ clinical testing. clonoSEQ test funds also increased by 45% versus prior year. 15:59 Shifting now to our operating cost and guidance on Slide 12.

Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $101.7 million, representing a 28% increase of $79.7 million in the same quarter last year. Cost of revenue was $13.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year, representing a 32% increase. Higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in material cost, due to revenue simple volume growth and an increase in labor, overhead  16:35 Research and development expenses for the first quarter of ’22 were $37.8 million, compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter 2021, representing a 12% increase. This increase was mainly attributable to increased personnel costs, including expenses related to our restructuring activities. 16:54 Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $26.1 million, compared to $20.6 million of the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 27%. This growth was largely due to increased personnel costs, primarily due to the expansion of our clonoSEQ sales team and related customer operations teams, as well as increased travel and customer event-related expenses. One-time charges from our restructuring efforts contributed to the growth in expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses, due to reduced corporate marketing efforts. 17:28 General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022, were $24.1 million, compared to $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 62%. The increase was primarily driven by expanding our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses. Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $62.8 million, compared to the first quarter of 2021 net loss of $40.6 million. 17:55 With respect to our full-year guidance we’re reiterating our revenue range of $185 million to $195 million, which already contemplated the MRT milestone we recognized', metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",

Thank you.\\nBrian Weinstein: 19:47 Hey, I just wanted to go through the growth rate here a little bit, because I know there is some moving parts here, it seems like in the quarter, because you posted basically flattish growth, but Kyle or Chad, can you guys just go through some of the factors that kind of drove that flattish growth, I heard some Genentech stuff that was in there? And in some other things that might have sort of impacted that growth rate on a one-time basis. I just want to make sure that we understand what those things were?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Kyle Piskel: 20:17 Sure, I'll take that, Brian. I’d, kind of, first like to start with the two main components that drive a bit of quarter-to-quarter comparative challenges. The first thing the MRD milestones and just as a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had approximately $7 million of milestones from our MRD business and this quarter we have $3 million, so we’re seeing $4 million in compression there from a comp perspective. 20:43 The second component is the Genentech amortization and comparing that to last quarter -- last year we had about $16 million versus this quarter where we're about $12 million. So those two things kind of really compress the growth. And if you back those out you’d see about 47% year-over-year growth. So that's kind of driving some of that uptick.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:05 And when we think about the Genentech amortization, it’s always somewhat of a black box for us I think how we should we be thinking about that going forward, I mean just so that we're level set here so that we can turn it back that stuff out in -- with a little bit more visibility. It's always our somewhat confusing for us?\\nKyle Piskel: 21:25 Yes, I'd say for the -- it's tied to our expense investment in the Genentech collaboration, I'd say for the remainder of the full-year, we're still on track to be about the same total revenues last year, maybe a little bit of a bell curve this year for Q2 and Q3 and that come back down a little bit to Q4. But overall, I'd say it will be fairly consistent to last year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:49 Got it and then Chad for you, obviously the markets are very focused on pushes towards profitability, cash flow breakeven. I don't think you guys will give you kind of formal talks about that, but I'd love to kind of have some sort of past that you guys are thinking about towards profitability, the steps that you guys think that you'll need to take and any thoughts on timing there?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Chad Robins: 22:15 Yes, so first I'll just acknowledge that the path to profitability and at least cash flow neutrality is incredibly important for us for Adaptive and we -- I think we got out ahead of it earlier -- early this year and took proactive steps with doing the restructuring and the reduction in force. We continue to look at ways to manage expenses and at the same time, look, we're looking at opportunities to bring in what I'll call non-dilutive cash flow through different partnership and financing mechanisms, look, let's face it, the cost of capital is high right now and we are -- on a past to do what we can. So we don't have to take in capital that will be dilutive to the company in this economic environment. 23:03 That's a two, where Tycho coming on board, we were really sharpening that long-range plan and should have better visibility into that time horizon to get you, kind of, cash flow profitability and should be providing that for you within the back half of the year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 23:23 Okay, thanks guys.\\nChad Robins: 23:25 Sure.

If I can, I'll ask to all at once, I guess first nice growth from clonoSEQ this quarter. Can you just comment on your visibility of what you're seeing in the field? Are you guys fully open nearly to pre-pandemic levels? And maybe just comment about what kind of access you have reps in the field versus virtual? And then the second question is on Slide 17, you show, you've got Crohn's and MS and Celiac kind of in the lead for your autoimmune diseases, should we think of those as like the lead candidates, I guess what my question really boils down to is to what extent are you committed to advancing and investing in RA, obviously Crohn's and Colitis are linked, so can you just help us think about the priorities of the autoimmune disease portfolio?\\nKyle Piskel: 26:04 Sure. Hi, Mark. I'm going to have Nitin Sood, who is Head of our MRD business, take the first question.

This is Harlan, so we're focusing our resources where our signals are most advanced and we have the highest quality samples for early diagnosis of disease. And of course having a high unmet need, we prioritized MS and Crohn's higher than RA simply, because we have -- we're a little bit farther behind in collecting RA samples, not for any other particular reason. And the key -- the real key that we're focusing on is our -- as our differentiator is specificity here. So just as reference we're aiming to really reduce the number of false positives. So that we can hit an earlier diagnostic market and so that's really been the focus, and that's where we've had the biggest increase in our signals as we go. And we're going to take the learnings from this and apply it into other diseases as we create panels. And in particular for IBD as we’re going to initiate sample collection for clinical validation study into the coming months.\\nMark Massaro: 28:13 Great, thank you.\\nOperator: 28:16 We have your next question from the Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.

Would you elaborate on the plans to reduce the work for us, or the reduction mostly and administrative overhead R&D or commercial, what projects do you deprioritize and should we anticipate any delays in key timelines as it relates to clonoSEQ inflection, expansion into DLBCL, any color around that would be great.\\nChad Robins: 29:27 Yes, sure. Hey  I'll take that. So first, we -- there was many areas affected across the business, but it wasn't uniformly distributed, for example, there were very, very few cuts in the MRD business. So to your questions about kind of DLBCL, or any of that kind of project development pipeline is, is all on track. In addition, the -- that's kind of the cell therapy group in San Francisco had very little cut, so there were cuts across going to general and administration, project management and frankly some it's duplicate of our stack hiring as well that we had an opportunity, frankly where we thought we could gain some efficiencies and leverage in the existing business. So we are moving forward and as Harlan said we're being very, very, very clinical if you will to -- these upon here on how we're prioritizing the T-Detect program and we're also being very opportunistic about continued investments for example in COVID given that's taking more of an endemic state and we've seen some of the T-Detect orders, kind of, wane as COVID kind of becomes more normalized in the population. So hopefully that's helpful color to you in terms of kind of how we looked at the reduction in force and prioritization.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",

And then on the product development expansion efforts into NHL, could you walk us through the rationale for using cell-free DNA. Is there a specific advantage using cell-free DNA in NHL versus some of the other indications? And could this be a strategy that you would like to deploy on a go-forward basis?\\nNitin Sood: 31:28 Yes, so I'll ask answer that question, this is Nitin. Specifically for DLBCL there have been studies that have been published that demonstrate that cell-free DNA is a better handle light, but for other diseases, namely CLL, ALL and multiple myeloma, our cellular assay, does really well. So on an ongoing basis, I don't expect any changes on those three indications. But for not much as lymphoma and more specifically for DLBCL, we're going with the analytes know has the best performance. 32:10 And longer-term on -- we will also look at potentially combining both the analytes namely the cell-free DNA analyte and the cellular assay. Obviously, we're the one company that can do both. So, we potentially look at combining both at the analytes.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 32:30 Great, thank you so much for that color.\\nOperator: 32:34 We have your next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nDerik de Bruin: 32:40 Hi, sorry about that my phone dropped earlier. Hey, can you give us some color on the ASPs for clonoSEQ. I mean, you didn't break out the clinical sequencing revenues, I'd like historically. So can you give us some idea on coverage on just the ASP and just give us, bit more clarity?\\nNitin Sood: 33:00 Yes. So I think this is Nitin again, we've seen steady ASP growth for clonoSEQ or the past couple of years and we're anticipating that the growth will continue in the mid single-digit range over the next two to three years. We're very close to about $1,000 in ASP today and our expectation is in two to three years, we're in the $1,200 to $1,300 range for ASP.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'ADPT', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1ADPT'}),\n",

I mean, do you expect, I mean, the cash burn was quite a bit higher in the first quarter, do you expect that to ramp down throughout the rest of the year? Basically, as the question on, do you have enough cash this year?\\nKyle Piskel: 33:42 Yes, this is Kyle. Yes, so a couple of things in Q1, obviously you don't have the full effect of our restructuring efforts in the cash burn, because of the timing of when we initiated that was late March. The second thing as it relates to Q1 is a bit of seasonality, we have our corporate bonus payouts in Q1.

       " Document(page_content='Melinda Whittington: 2:09 Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon following the close of market, we reported our fiscal ’22 third quarter results, which included delivered consolidated sales of a strong 22% versus last Q3, including record delivered sales and operating profit for our company owned retail segment. Ongoing strong demand versus pre-pandemic levels $32 million, returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total up to $96 million and all time high and closing on 2 important acquisitions to five La-Z-Boy furniture gallery stores in the Alabama market and the Furnico (ph) Manufacturing Company in the UK. 2:59 While delivering strong top line growth, the quarter also had significant challenges. After a very strong November across the majority of our business, supply chain volatility amplified in the balance of the quarter, even beyond our previous expectations. This had a significant near-term impact on the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity ramp plans, affecting both sales and profit performance 3:27 Within our own manufacturing operations, which comprise the majority of our wholesale business, lack of availability of component parts, including electronic chips and actuators, continued to disrupt production plans but at a higher level than we expected. Beyond the obvious direct production delays, these outages drove inefficiencies as manufacturing cells are trained on specific unit styles and need to retrain on other styles until parts are available. This was exacerbated by such a large portion of our manufacturing staff being relatively new, given our significant capacity expansion, including 3 new facilities in Mexico over the past year. 4:11 Further, these parts outages are disproportionately affecting our higher end products, which sell at a greater level in our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, including our own retail, thereby magnifying the near-term', metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

In one particular instance, we have sent a La-Z-Boy team to work in the plant of one of our domestic suppliers to help increase their production of component parts for La-Z-Boy, as they too are experiencing labor challenges. We will continue to make progress here. The global supply chain disruptions remain prevalent and we will likely be managing them for a while. 5:10 Additionally, the 14-week COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam, where the majority of our casegoods product is sourced significantly impacted our wholesale segment resulting from minimal inventory available to ship to consumers and high freight costs during the quarter. Product is flowing again, and we expect casegoods sales and profits to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 when we were more consistently received product to ship to customers. 5:43 Further exacerbating the disruption this quarter, the Omicron variant impacted plant operations and production across all geographies. In January, at times we had as much as 20% of our manufacturing workforce out, due to contraction of the virus or exposure. As the health and safety of our team remains our highest priority. These peaks are orders of magnitude higher than our previous worst peaks last winter. As with much of North America, we're now seeing the number of COVID cases trend downward quickly, but it will take time to recover from the disruption. 6:24 Managing across these challenges, as well as the ongoing tight labor market and increasing input costs, has resulted in production gains being slower than expected, impacting the pace of delivered sales and profitability growth in the near\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

Our number one focus across the company is to improve the agility of our supply chain to increase production more quickly and efficiently. We have deployed SWAT teams comprised of some of our most experienced leaders to our newer, most challenged locations to assist in training and increasing output. We have hired additional key leadership with expertise from other industries to bring fresh perspectives to our challenges, working alongside our industry veterans. And as noted, we continue to identify and act on creative solutions to upstream supply challenges, including expanded sourcing diversity, protective inventory builds and even helping suppliers staff extra shifts to supply key component parts 7:33 These challenges while significant, are temporary in nature and each day we get better at managing through them. Ultimately, demand for our product is strong and we are already delivering sales at all-time record levels. But we must do better to weather each disruption, continue to increase our capacity, improve cost efficiencies, work down our backlog, and service our customers and consumers. While working toward the double digit profitability levels, we know we can achieve in the longer-term with our expanded North American footprint. 8:14 Turning back to the top line and demand for our products, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries Network increased 3% in the fiscal ’22 third quarter and we are at 9% compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 quarter for a compound annual growth rate of 4% across the 2 years. Sales to the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network represent about half of our total manufactured La-Z-Boy products and are directionally indicative of the continued strength of demand for our product over time. 8:52 For our company own stores, our retail segment written same-store sales were down 1% versus the prior year third', metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Bob Lucian: 10:27 Thank you, Melinda and good morning everyone. As a reminder, we present our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We believe a non-GAAP presentation better reflects the underlying operating trends and performance of the business. Non GAAP results exclude items which are detailed in our press release and in the tables in the appendix section of our conference call slides. 10:51 On a consolidated basis, fiscal ’22 third quarter sales increased 22% to $572 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting continued strong demand and ongoing manufacturing capacity increases as well as the effects of pricing and surcharge actions. Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter sales were 20% higher for a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the last 2 years. 11:21 Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $39 million versus the prior year period. And non-GAAP operating income was $40 million. Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.9% and non-GAAP operating margin was 7.0%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 for the fiscal ’22 third quarter versus $0.62 and the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 in the current year quarter versus $0.74 and last year's third quarter. 11:52 As I moved to the segment discussion, my comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise. Demand for and delivery of product across the enterprise remains strong. Starting with our wholesale segment delivered sales for the quarter grew 21% to $423 million compared with the prior year period, driven by pricing and surcharge actions as well as higher volume. 12:21 Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 6.5% versus 10.2% and last year’s third quarter. This reflects higher raw material and freight costs sourcing related tariff and duty increases in disruption from component parts shortages.

Additionally, COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam significantly impacted the product flow and margin performance of our casegoods business.

Fixed Costs leverage on higher volume and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales. 13:16 For the quarter, our retail segment delivered sales increased 19% to an all-time record $197 million, delivered same-store sales increase 16% versus the year ago quarter. Retail posted record high non-GAAP operating profit dollars and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 12.2% versus 8.9% in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by fixed costs leverage on the higher delivered sales volume in discipline expense management. Joybird, which is reported in corporate and other posted record sales of $45 million, a 56% increase versus the prior year quarter. On a two-year basis, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter deliver sales more than doubled, representing a compound annual growth rate of 43%. This reflects the Momentum Joybird is building in the direct to consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels. 14:23 Joybird’s profit for the quarter was roughly breakeven as we invested significantly in marketing to grow the business while experiencing increased raw material and freight costs which negatively impacted gross margin.

       " Document(page_content=\"we will continue to invest in marketing to deliver disproportionate brand growth while sustaining profitability. 14:52 Putting all of this together, consolidated non GAAP gross margin for the entire company for fiscal ’22 third quarter decreased 440 basis points versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to the challenges noted in wholesale offset partially by pricing and surcharge actions. 15:10 Consolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased 190 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed costs leverage on a higher sales volume across our wholesale and retail segments. Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal ’22 third quarter was 24.8% versus 27.7% and last year's third quarter. The third quarter of last year was unfavorably impacted by a non-deductible fair value adjustment of the contingent liability related to the acquisition of our Joybird business. Our effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to state taxes. We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal ’22 year to be to be between 25.5% and 26.5%. 16:02 Turning to cash year-to-date, we generated $45 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the period with $240 million in cash and no debt and held $30 million in investments to enhance returns on cash. Year-to-date, we've invested $83 million in higher inventory levels to help protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production and delivered sales. We have also spent $59 million in capital year-to-date primarily related to improve in store – retail stores. New upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico, plant upgrades at our manufacturing and distribution facilities and technology upgrades. 16:45 Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter, we continue to buy back shares, spending $25 million repurchasing more than 700,000 shares of stock in the open market, leaving 7.9 million shares in our existing authorized share repurchase\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

Year-to-date, we have returned $76 million to shareholders via share repurchase and $21 million through dividends including $70 million paid in dividends in the third quarter. 17:16 Before turning the call back to Melinda, let me highlight several important items for the remainder of fiscal ’22. As noted, demand trends are strong across the business and remain much higher than pre-COVID levels, and our backlog remains high. To address this strong demand, we will continue to improve our agility and ability to increase production capacity, although our near-term gains will be slower than previously anticipated. Efficient plant expansion will also benefit when global supply chain disruptions begin to stabilize although this timing is unknown, and these challenges will likely continue to disproportionately impact our higher end products, which sell a greater level and our La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Stores. 18:02 Specifically the casegoods import business, we expect operations to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 as we more consistently receive product and ship it to our customers. The fourth quarter will benefit by containing 14 production weeks compared to 12 production weeks in our third quarter. To recall fiscal ’22 will include 53 weeks of results versus 52 weeks last year. 18:29 Taking all of these factors into consideration, we now expect delivered sales per week in Q4 to be flat to slightly up versus the third quarter and consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to strengthen to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. We maintain our long-term commitment to steady margin progress, as we deliver incremental capacity increases with our rebalanced North America manufacturing footprint and improve our ability to adjust the supply chain disruptions. 19:00 This will enable us to better service the demand for our highest value products, which disproportionately sell', metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

So Bob, is the – is the cost pressures that we're seeing in supply chain wise is more in efficiencies and just having to expedite things and challenges that way versus, just pure cost of items, or you're going to have to take based on some of these more recent challenges you caught out, you're gonna have to take more pricing to get whole again, as well.\\nBob Lucian: 22:36 It's more of a, it's more of a former of what you talked about relative to some of the inefficiencies that we have in our operations and the hits that we're taking as it relates to supply chain disruptions, and the extra work and money and effort we have to spend to deal with that.\\nBobby Griffin: 22:50 Okay.\\nMelinda Whittington: 22:51 Now, that said, we're constantly watching input costs, and we'll continue to price as needed as we go forward.\\nBobby Griffin: 23:00 Okay, that makes sense. And then, I guess, secondly for me -- and that's helpful. I appreciate the detail on the last one. Secondly for me, I know we typically want to get the backlog once a year in the 10-K, but times are a little more unique now and given the size of the backlog. I was hoping maybe just to get a little color on directionally where it's at. Written trends have been positive year-to-date, production has increased.

And again, it's an equation of strong demand continued, and capacity ramping, but not fast enough to shorten our lead times.\\nBobby Griffin: 24:09 Okay, That’s helpful. And then I guess, lastly for me, we have gotten a couple of questions. When you look at the written same-store sales for the owned and licensed stores, sort of the whole La-Z-Boy network. On a two year basis, they did slow sequentially and now, I guess my question is, I understand timing wise, the price increases and stuff last year can mess with the seasonality.

And Canada, they were shut down a year ago, for the most part, you get a lot of different wiggles at any given period. But overall, the written trends still stay strong, and our businesses is 30% bigger than it was before the pandemic. So our focus is on continuing to grow that, obviously, we want to keep kind of that same-store sales, written business strong. I mentioned in my prepared comments that right now, our average is about $5 million per store on existing stores. And before the pandemic, it was $4 million. But at the same time, we'll look to expand stores and expand the number of stores we own as well.

This is Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti and company and good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So looking at the guidance for operating margin for Q4, what are the biggest factors as far as driving that sequential increase that you expect?\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Bob Lucian: 26:48 The biggest factors are continuing to make progress against increasing our capacity, getting the hire – continuing to hire and train and retain the folks that we need for that capacity, as well as opportunities that we have to improve our mix with better, I should say slightly improving parts outages on some of the higher cost products that we make and sell through our retail outlets. So those are the key factors that we expect, that will help us to drive it sequentially higher margin versus what we just delivered.\\nMelinda Whittington: 27:24 And those are really Anthony, the same – the same factors we've been looking at all along, we're marching towards stronger capacity and more efficient capacity builds. Unfortunately, this quarter, we had more setbacks than we expected on that trajectory. And it's going to recognize and it's going to take time, but it's really all about driving that capacity, servicing the consumer and getting more efficient as we go.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 27:57 Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the component shortages that you spoke about, so since the quarter ended last month, but has there been any notable change? Or is it just kind of more of the same?\\nBob Lucian: 28:09 There has been – there's been incremental sequential improvement, it's not fixed. I mean, we're some of the work that we're doing with some of our suppliers, and some of the extra suppliers that we're bringing online, are starting to have a more positive impact relative to their shortages. But it's not a just flip a switch, turn it on, and always problems go away. So that will just continue to improve as we move through the quarter and into the first half of next year.\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Anthony Lebiedzinski: 28:40 That's okay, so that's encouraging to hear. And the last question for me, so Joybird again, did very well. Now accounting for 8% of total sales for the quarter, longer-term hub, how should we think about the growth of that business as to how big it could ultimately become and as that happens? How should we think about profitability of that segment? Longer-term?\\nMelinda Whittington: 29:03 Yeah, we have, as we've laid out our Century Vision, we obviously a huge building block of that Century Vision for growth over time, we've said as a total company, we believe we can grow ahead of the industry. One pillar that is the La-Z-Boy brand, and really reinvigorating that brand. A second pillar is really leveraging the opportunity that the room that we believe we have for Joybird to grow as a consumer brand, so we will continue to invest in that brand. And we do believe it will disproportionately grow within our business and our focus is on maintaining a reasonable profitability with that business, but not necessarily expecting it to look like, an integrated profit on our La-Z-Boy brand, because it is in growth mode. So in different modes of its – of its maturity.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 30:00 Understood. Okay.

But maybe just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the written orders and wondering if you could provide any color on, how things trended through the quarter what you're seeing thus far. In February, we've obviously heard broader concerns about Omicron weather, and lapping stimulus payments as having been headwinds for the consumer of late. Just curious if you're seeing any of that in your business.\\nMelinda Whittington: 31:08 Yes. I can't say there's any dramatic trend change through the quarter other than, as I noted, we saw January hit by Omicron temporarily, right? That was fairly fast. If you think about, again, from a comparison standpoint, Canada was essentially shut down last year. Now they're open. So on a comparison basis, Canada looks great. But from a more long-term trend, I don't think we're seeing any dramatic change per se.\\nBradley Thomas: 31:47 That's helpful. And so with what you're seeing today, you feel like your fiscal fourth quarter is tracking up so far on a written basis, is that right?\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Melinda Whittington: 31:59 Yes. I guess I would – I'm not going to comment on written for fourth quarter right now as there are so many different moving pieces, including in the base. But I would just point out a couple of things as we think – I think written same-store sales is an important metric to kind of look at what are you doing with an existing asset base over time. 32:26 But I would also challenge that it's maybe – it certainly isn't the only metric to look at any of these businesses right now when the base period is so different than what it has been in the past. So today, our stores are averaging $5 million in delivered sales per year compared to 2 years ago pre-COVID, they were $4 million a year, right? So what the – what we are growing off of that base, what we are achieving off of that base of any given store is 30% more than it had been. 33:07 As we go forward, we'll continue to look at how do you drive more off of that same base of stores, for sure, that same written same-store sale number. But what we're also looking at is part of Century Vision, expanding the number of stores. And we've talked in the past around – we believe there's opportunity for, call it, about 50 additional stores just with an existing space where the marketplace would support additional stores. We'll continue to also grow through acquisition like we did at the Alabama stores here in the last couple of months through, as we have in the past on some of the independently owned. And then, of course, through our other businesses as well. 33:54 So written same-store sales is an important metric, and we believe it will continue to be directionally positive over time, but it's not the only metric by which to evaluate the growth of our business as we go forward, or anyone's business, I would say, coming off of this unusual pandemic time.\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Bradley Thomas: 34:15 Got you. That's helpful context. Thank you. And then I guess just as we think some of the product inability or longer-than-usual times that you're quoting and some of the mix dynamics, I guess just as we're thinking about on whatever basis you want to talk about, delivered sales and reported sales or written sales, is there any way that you think that sales of any sort are being impacted right now by what your offering is like? And if so, any ability to quantify it? Again, I'm just trying to put context around it. Some of the stuff.\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Melinda Whittington: 34:52 Sure, absolutely. So from – a couple of things. Right now, we're quoting 4 to 6 months lead time, and that is not where we would be. That's on our La-Z-Boy business. We're shorter on our Joybird business right now. That's not good service to our customers or our consumers, right? 35:10 And so it all sort of comes down to our whole focus is on getting that supply chain expansion up running and running as efficiently as our plants have run over time. That's got to happen. As we do that, just simply with what's in our backlog, our backlog is still at all-time highs on our La-Z-Boy business. So just with what's in our backlog alone, we will continue to drive increased delivered sales and improve profitability quarter-on-quarter. 35:47 And we've got a runway again, just with the orders that are already on the books to drive delivered sales incrementally improving week after week. This quarter, a little bit slower than what we had hoped, but we will continue to work through that and through as Bob noted, for quarters to come, we expect to see incremental improvement in capacity. And given even just the orders on the books, that turns into delivered sales right away. 36:16 At the same time, as we're looking at how do you keep filling the coffer again, right? We want to drive that backlog down because we want to be delivering better service to our customers and our consumers. But as we drive that backlog down, we want to be filling that coffer with more sales to deliver. And so with that, we will continue to drive, strengthening written sales. And we believe we can do that through the strength of our brands. And with our Century Vision, I'm really reinvigorating the brand equities as well, to ensure we're growing for the long term. 36:52 Now the exact pace of that on any given quarter may shift around a little bit, but we feel confident that our last – our trailing 12 months is about $2.2 billion in sales for total company.

       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Lucian: 37:25 One thing I'd add to that, just from a – how do you feel about the business. When a consumer walks in and they're paying more money for product, and we're telling them it's still going to take them 4 to 6 months to get that product and our sales -- our written sales are still strong, that's a good indication that the brand is strong and that some of the concerns that are out there, that you've written about around stimulus checks going away and other doom and gloom on the industry, we're a little bit more bullish from that standpoint, from an industry perspective, because we're able to weather the higher prices and the longer lead times. Not happy about either one of those things, but we're here to make sure that the consumers who come in want furniture, get that furniture.\\nBradley Thomas: 38:15 Absolutely. And no question the industry is facing just untested level of complexities and challenges right now and you're navigating many of those very well. Just on some of the guidance for the fourth quarter, I just want to make sure people are doing the math right here. I think if we looked at 12 weeks versus 14 weeks and on a per week basis being flat to up, that implies that sales may be up in your fiscal fourth quarter, perhaps high 20s to low 30s percent. Just with the consensus sitting here now, I think only 23% growth. I just want to make sure we're doing the math right there. Bob?\\nRobert Lucian: 38:56 The math is correct to take your Q3 divided by 12, multiply it by 14 and it will be that or slightly better than that.\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Bradley Thomas: 39:08 Perfect. And then just a last one for me about coming back to margins that are clearly a focal point here. I guess as you reflect on the third quarter and some of the guidance here for 4Q, how much do you think is kind of clear cut? Oh, this should go away if we just give it time. This is part of the transitory issues we're dealing with in the pandemic, versus issues that may be a little bit more structural. And I guess, how, if at all, is your kind of long-term outlook for operating margins for La-Z-Boy changing?\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Melinda Whittington: 39:40 Brad, I'll talk about that in a bit, and then Bob can add in. It's a little bit of each of those. So the first thing is we've got 3 brand-new plants that we've opened in Mexico, as well as the labor challenges in the U.S. So we've got a lot of new people making furniture. And we've talked in the past about it takes 6 to 9 months to sort of get them up to average – kind of average throughput and when that many people are new, that probably slows that down a little bit. 40:14 So a healthy chunk of what we saw this quarter is we were really now with -- we just in January, opened that third brand-new plant. We are every day adding more to the sales and the production capacity. What we saw this quarter is those continued and exacerbated disruptions on parts, the different – the Omicron, outages, and so you're always putting different – in the end, it's an artesian process. So you're always putting different people together trying to make furniture. 40:44 So what we saw is we didn't get the efficiency gains that we expected to in this quarter. That doesn't mean they're not there. And so a big piece of our progress on margin and we're just trying to be realistic about you're dealing with training thousands of people, we're trying to be realistic about how quickly we come up on that. But a big chunk of that progress forward is controlling our own destiny, right? It's getting better every day at training folks to be able to be very efficient on furniture production and getting better at weathering the uncontrollables. 41:24 So there's no doubt, again, the chip shortages continue they actuate as you pick your thing, and we're investing in inventory to manage as much of that disruption as possible. But there are some things like, you can't go buy more chips, right? They just don't exist. So some of those things are real, but we have to work on our own agility to manage that. 41:47 So yes, there will continue to be disruptions.

And at the end of this, we'll have a better distributed footprint of where our manufacturing facilities lie across all of North America that sets us up with a better overall structure, cost structure and service structure than we had pre-pandemic, even though I think some of the external headwinds will probably -- inflation and so forth, will exist for the longer-term.\", metadata={'quarter': 3, 'symbol': 'LZB', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q3LZB'}),\n",

The only material non-operating item this quarter was just over $10 million in merger-related expenses. Importantly, credit quality continues to be a bright spot for us. We reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter we've been able to post net recoveries. 02:24 We also reported a 22% decline in non-performing loans and leases during the quarter from an already relatively low position.

We're working well together and collaboration is very high. We've done extensive planning and testing for our conversion, which is in line with our original time frame, expecting to do our conversion in the early fourth quarter of this year. 03:55 We're seeing pretty positive growth for customers really throughout the footprint. Texas and Florida stood out this quarter from a community bank standpoint, and our corporate and specialty teams reported nice growth throughout the footprint. 04:07 As I spend time with our bankers, we're making a lot of calls. We're out knocking on doors. We've returned to the office. It's a bit of a hybrid model, but we're out looking for, of course, loans, deposits, but assets under management and more insurance business. We're doing a lot of blocking and tackling.

       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 04:34 Great. Thank you, Paul. Turning to this quarter's results Slide four provides a view of our summary income statement. And just as a reminder, with the October 29th closing of our merger, the first quarter of 2022 is the first reporting period that we've had a full quarter of the combined results of both legacy Cadence and legacy BancorpSouth. I would also remind you that fourth quarter 2021 results were adversely impacted by the day one provision for credit losses and other merger related items. 05:02 For the first quarter, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $112.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $121.6 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue or PPNR was $160 million or 1.36% of average assets. There are three key themes as you look at our results for the quarter. First, our continued loan growth has allowed us to grow net interest income and see positive movement in our margins. Second, our non-interest revenue businesses are performing very well. And third, credit quality continues to remain strong, supporting the lack of provision for credit losses for the quarter. 05:46 As shown on Slide five, we reported net interest income of $312 million and a net interest margin of 2.92% for the first quarter, up from 2.90% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of accretion, the linked quarter net interest margin increased by 3 basis points. The yield of net loans, excluding accretion was 3.96% for the first quarter, down 10 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to the full quarterly impact of the legacy Cadence variable rate loan portfolio, C&I portfolio. 06:21 Similarly, the full quarter's merger impact drove our securities yields higher and funding costs lower, offsetting the decline in loan yield. Our total cost of deposits declined to 15 basis points in the quarter. As we look forward, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",

As we look forward, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from rate increases with 69% of our loan portfolio floating or variable. 06:43 Slides six and seven provide some additional color on our non-interest revenue and non-interest expense. Included in non-interest revenue, the quarter's insurance commission revenue benefit from seasonality, a high retention rate and new customer wins. Mortgage banking revenue increased largely due to the impact of rising interest rates on our MSR assets. And as we look at our expenses for the quarter, first quarter is generally seasonally high as a result of resets of payroll taxes and 401(k) match, as well as higher commissions led to seasonally higher insurance revenue. 07:17 Even so, the quarter's adjusted efficiency ratio was stable at 63.5%, and we continue to expect full realization of the merger efficiencies during 2023. While not related to the first quarter, we did announce an increase of our minimum wage to $18 per hour effective the beginning of April, as we continue to see wage pressure, particularly in some of our larger markets. 07:41 Before turning it over to Chris, I would like to touch briefly on the changes in tangible book value. Like many others in the industry, our tangible book value was impacted this quarter by the AOCI marks that are available for sale securities portfolio, due to the rising rate environment. To help clarify the impact, we have disclosed tangible book value per share, both including AOCI and excluding it. Excluding AOCI, tangible book value per share of $19.29 actually increased during the quarter despite our active share repurchases. It is also important to remember what drove this quarter's change in AOCI as simply a change in fair valuation driven by interest rate changes, and this fair value adjustment does not impact our regulatory capital ratios in any way. 08:26 I'll turn it over to Chris for a little more on our business activities highlight.

I would like to expand on the three key highlights for the quarter mentioned by Valerie, loan growth, credit quality, and non-interest revenue growth. As reflected on Slide eight, we reported net organic loan growth for the quarter of just over $300 million or 4.6% annualized, coming primarily in our C&I book. Hank will make some additional comments on the loan growth efforts in a moment. But as Paul mentioned, we saw a nice growth in our Texas and Florida markets within the community bank and across our footprint in the corporate banking and specialty lending units. 09:04 Credit quality continues to be a positive story for us, which is highlighted on Slide 10. As Dan mentioned, we reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported net recoveries. Our total non-performing loans declined $34.5 million or 22% during the quarter, bringing period-end NPLs to net loans and leases to 44 basis points, while non-performing assets also experienced a similar decline. 09:32 Non-interest revenue, which is highlighted on Slide 13, thus insurance having a nice quarter and reporting total commission revenue, up $36 million for the quarter or 17% for the first quarter of last year. Growth came primarily in our property and casualty portfolio as retention rates remain high and as we also picked up some nice customer wins. Mortgage reported origination volume of $804 million for the quarter with just over 70% being purchased. While we are pleased with production volume, rising rates do pressure our gain on sale margin, which is 1.24% for the first quarter. 10:07 Finally, I'd like to highlight our Wealth and Trust teams, which reported revenue for the quarter of $21.7 million. I'd also like to highlight that this revenue number is up from $8.4 million for the same quarter of '21 and reflects the contribution of the legacy CADE trust and wealth services and the\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",

I was pleased to see that commercial loan growth in the quarter was spread throughout the corporate C&I teams across the footprint. Our bankers have been leveraging the expanded platform and bringing in more wins as the economy stabilized post-COVID. Specialized lending and renewable energy teams have been quite active, other areas are seeing payoff slow, and we have the teams in place to continue growth. 11:06 I am feeling positive about the growth this year as pipelines remain healthy. In particular, our technology, healthcare and C&I groups are seeing attractive opportunities in our combined markets and throughout the footprint. We are adding good CRE projects from our community bank and corporate CRE teams, primarily in multi-family housing. 11:25 Construction loans continue to fund, but we are still seeing lower utilization. Given the volatility in long-term interest rates, we do anticipate utilization in our construction portfolio to increase over the next 12 to 24 months to more normal or historical levels. Our focus on credit continues to be disciplined. We are not competing at higher leverage points with non-banks on EV loans. The markets continue to be competitive, but the pressure on terms and pricing seems to have settled some. Our teams have come together nicely, and I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm and commitment.

Good morning, everyone.\\nDan Rollins: 12:32 Hey, Jon.\\nJon Arfstrom: 12:34 You talked a little bit about overall growth expectations for the company. I saw you put up $300 million in organic growth. And just there's a lot of churn between the two companies, I would guess, but just talk a little bit about your expectations? And is that a reasonable pace? Or do you expect that, that can accelerate a bit?\\nDan Rollins: 12:52 I'll let everybody jump in on that. There's lots of activity going on, on the growth side of the house. There has been some churn. We continue to see payoffs on CRE flow-through. There's just a lot of activity. Pipelines are also big. So Hank and Chris, you guys are driving some of that to add in.\\nHank Holmes: 13:13 Hey Jon, appreciate the question. So as I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of balanced growth. The pipelines continue to be strong, in my opinion. And I think that with some of the areas like in our renewable energy and certainly the energy component of our bank with prices where they are, some opportunities there. And the C&I teams are just getting a lot of looks. And so the activity is high. Chris, do you want to add something to that?\\nChris Bagley: 13:39 Yes. Just with rates trending up, that's probably going to slow down some of the churn, especially on a community bank, refinance side. But -- it also could impact maybe opportunities as folks are looking at higher interest rates on their projects until that factors in. So how is that right down the middle of the fairway for you?\\nDan Rollins: 13:57 We have some pretty significant unfunded construction lines out there.\\nChris Bagley: 14:00 Right, we did.\\nDan Rollins: 14:02 So yes, there's some activity going on, Jon. We're excited about what the team has been able to do in light of all the changes that we keep throwing out.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:10 Okay. So it feels good, maybe a little bit better is a good summary?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Jon Arfstrom: 14:10 Okay. So it feels good, maybe a little bit better is a good summary?\\nDan Rollins: 14:13 I think, we feel excited about the opportunities.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:16 Okay. Plenty of other place I could go, but just as long as we're on this topic, Hank, you talked about the competitive environment being settled some. And I think that's somewhat encouraging others have said it's ultra competitive. But can you give us a little bit more in terms of examples of what you're seeing there?\\nHank Holmes: 14:31 Sure. It's -- we're always -- we're in a competitive business and it's always competitive. So where I see some slowdown is, we obviously, in CRE, we saw rates fall dramatically over the last 24 months. That seems to have settled down. We're not chasing terms and leverage points on EV and other areas that we compete in are modest or where I would say historically, we're not chasing at this point. So I feel pretty good about where we are from the terms and pricing, but it is competitive.\\nChris Bagley: 15:05 A lot that covered there, and bring the two companies together, there's a lot more emphasis or just the market and type of customer base on the CRE side for legacy CADE. That's floating rate, so that's a nice pickup for us, especially in the rate environment we're moving into. We are still seeing in the community bank markets, upward pressure on rates there, everybody hold it. It's still pretty competitive out there, recently as last month, we saw some three handles, but now you're seeing all that move into the four, kind of a four handle side, not as many three handles. So good upward pressure on the right field as well.\\nJon Arfstrom: 15:41 Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nDan Rollins: 15:44 Thanks, Jon.\\nOperator: 15:47 The next question is from Catherine Mealor of KBW.

Just want to say on the loan conversation and talk about loan yields. And maybe it's for Valerie. Just kind of walk us through, you mentioned 69% of your loan book is floating or variable. Can you just walk us through to remind us what percentage now today is floating immediately? And once we get past, let's just say we get 50 bps in May, so then we're kind of three rate hikes through, how much you're kind of coming off the floors? And then the -- kind of the timeline on the remaining variable piece of the portfolio, just to kind of get a sense as to how quickly we should see these loan yields move higher. Thanks.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 16:32 Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Catherine, for the questions. Great questions. Back -- last quarter, we said that it would take about 40 basis points movement in order to get our loans in average off the floors the $7.5 billion or so that we had on the floors. Well, we've had a whole lot of that movement actually in the market take place already. And so the next movement will definitely get those off their floors. We do have about $7.6 billion of our loan portfolio is actually floating. And so that's less than 30 days and so 28% of that book. 17:09 When you look at the total book, we've got about 50% of our entire portfolio that will reprice over the next year. And so that gives you a little bit better timing on some of that, with most of that actually coming in the next three month period. And so again, that positions us really nicely as we look at some of the increases that we expect coming down the road. 17:34 When you take a look at some of the portfolio, we are starting to see the impact of some of the rate increases on some of the renewals come through as not only renewals, but also loans that are simply just repricing, starting to see that come through, and we'll definitely see that impact more in the second quarter. New loans on average are coming on around the 360 level, but again, about two-thirds of those are variable rate. And so those will continue to move. Does that help, what you were looking for?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Catherine Mealor: 18:09 Yes, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then my next question is on the expenses. So I fully appreciate that this quarter is elevated, because it's a 1Q elevation and then we don't have the full impact of the cost savings in. Is there -- can you just kind of help us take a step back big picture maybe what's a good quarterly run rate we should get to kind of by the end of the year once we have the cost savings fully baked in? Or any kind of guidance you could give us on where you think the expense run rate is going just to make sure we're all on the same page. Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 18:42 I remember, we're on a 4Q integration plan. And so I don't know that we'll have a good clean run rate in 4Q. So I would put that out there first. I think we expect 1Q to be fully baked in, as we get into 4Q and we're -- as Paul said, we're on schedule, we're on task, we've actually completed two huge hurdles just in the last 1.5 months, working towards our full integration. But you're right, 1Q expense run is high. There's lots of things that are in there just naturally. And then when you look at the things we were doing through the merger, I feel pretty confident that we're on our run rate to exceed -- meet or exceed the numbers that we put out there. Valerie has been looking at numbers up while I've been talking.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 19:26 Yes. I think what might help, I know that the first quarter has a lot of noise and of course, the fourth quarter was very noisy given the timing of the merger date. Last quarter, we disclosed our combined third quarter F '21 expenses. And on an adjusted basis, that was $277 million, compared to the first quarter adjusted expenses of $281 million. But as we talked about, this first quarter did have the resets of the 401(k) match and the payroll taxes. 20:00 And so if you normalize that, and then we also had a bonus that we provided to a number of our employees for inflationary purposes in the first quarter. That amounted about $2.8 million. So when you combine all of that together, effectively, third quarter '21 to first quarter '21, expenses actually came down about $7.4 million. And so that will give you a little bit of a sense of some of the initial incremental merger cost saves that we're starting to see kind of in the underlying foundation. 20:35 That being said, it's going to be bumpy until we get through this conversion. We do have -- we talked about we did increase our hourly wage to $18 per hour. We also have our merit increases in the July 1 time period. And so all that will be a little bit bumpy until we do get finished with the conversion. But of course, none of this includes savings from any branch efficiencies -- and then certainly, some of the savings that we know will come after we are running on one operating system.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 21:10 The wage pressure is still big. And so Valerie hit two topics there. You want to make sure we cover again. So we did change our incoming wage minimum to $18 an hour on April 1. That's a pretty big run rate. That's going to be close to $10 million on an annual run to plug that in. And then our normal merit cycle for everyone that wasn't in that group hits on July 1. So we will see some upward pressure on comp, even excluding the savings and the drop-offs that are there, we are seeing, you saw headcount drop in the quarter, and we continue to see some of that. But as Valerie said, it's going to be bumpy as we move down the path.\\nCatherine Mealor: 21:55 Great. That's clear. Appreciate that, and it's very helpful. Thank you.\\nDan Rollins: 22:00 Thanks, Catherine.\\nOperator: 22:02 The next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist. Please go ahead.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:10 Thanks. Good morning.\\nDan Rollins: 22:11 Hey, Jenni.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:13 Hi. Just curious, the asset quality is very, very strong. But what do you think are the most vulnerable loan buckets as rates go up and most susceptible here to rising loan losses over the next several quarters?\\nDan Rollins: 22:32 Yes, that's a good question. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of net recoveries. We haven't experienced a lot of losses likely. So I guess looking forward is an important piece of that. I don't know that I have one bucket that I would want to call out. Paul, you got anything you want to add to that?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Paul Murphy: 22:46 Well, I would just observe that the -- really the merger is a huge de-risking of both balance sheet and diversification of the loan portfolio. And yes, like Dan, I wouldn't point to any one category as higher risk. I think the risk is well managed across the company. And I would say maybe the previous higher-risk energy portfolio has been de-risked significantly with higher rates as we're seeing profitability in the E&P sector is spectacular. And that, of course, benefits the midstream and the oilfield service portfolio. So -- it's a granular, very diverse credit profile and one of the key reasons why we like the combination so much.\\nDan Rollins: 23:35 Yes. From a credit quality perspective, this is the best credit we've been posting for either of us in quite some time.\\nHank Holmes: 23:41 And I would just add to that. And when you look at the balance sheets of the businesses, they're extremely strong, a lot of liquidity there. I think we're well positioned if we do have some bumps in the quarters to come from an economic perspective and with rates increasing, but I think we're well prepared for that. And I think our borrowers are as well.\\nJennifer Demba: 24:00 What do you think a normal range of annual loan losses is for this company over an economic cycle?\\nDan Rollins: 24:09 I don't have a number to stick on to that. I mean that's a good question. Valerie, you want to add?\\nValerie Toalson: 24:16 Yes. I think that's a little bit of a challenging number. But as far as like annualized net charge-offs, legacy Cadence, we would guide toward a 25 basis points normalized over a period of time, net charge-offs. I'd say that's lower from the legacy BancorpSouth history. And so something below those lines?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Paul Murphy: 24:42 When you look at the COVID stress test and some of the portfolios that you might have been concerned about hospitality at legacy BancorpSouth, I mean it just came through with great marks. And so I think Valerie is on the right path, 25 basis points might have been sort of what we thought about for CADE, but something less than that. So combined, I don't know, 10 to 15 basis points. But to hit a narrow range.\\nDan Rollins: 25:10 We're clearly watching the clouds that are out there. I mean, I think your question is fair. It appears that there could be some economic headwinds that were there. We're hoping that they blow by and we don't experience some of that. But we have to be prepared for that.\\nJennifer Demba: 25:27 Thanks so much.\\nDan Rollins: 25:28 Thanks, Jenni.\\nOperator: 25:31 The next question is from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Rose: 25:37 Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So it looks like the buybacks were weighted towards the back half of the quarter. But as we move forward, just given the drop in DCE and understand the conversation, Valerie, about the mechanics of the AOCI hit. But would that give any sort of pause to future repurchases? And should the stock remain under pressure? Is there capacity at this point? Do you think to actually increase the size of the repurchase? Thanks.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 26:14 Yes. So I think a couple of things. Valerie can certainly jump in here. But when you look at the tangible book value, excluding AOCI, we were actually up in the quarter. AOCI to use another word would be transitory and over time neither one of us have had a habit of trading in that portfolio, so that will work its way through over time and the fact that the tangible book value went up excluding that, which is on Page four of the deck, I think, is a positive thing. I think we want to be opportunistic on buyback. I don't think we want to be locked out of the market, but I also think we need to be cognizant of all the moving pieces, which includes AOCI, Valerie?\\nValerie Toalson: 26:51 Yes. No, I think you really hit on all the points. I think certainly, we've always been opportunistic in the past. The first quarter was pretty heavy activity. It may be a little bit more measured going forward. But again, we have a history, and I anticipate that we'll continue to be opportunistic and do what makes the most sense, balancing all the other things that we have going on. Obviously, loan growth continues to be picking up. And so that is obviously another primary use of capital.\\nMichael Rose: 27:23 Understood. Thanks. And then just on the accretion this quarter. Obviously, it was a little bit higher than I think I was looking for at least understand how much you have left. Was there any sort of accelerated paydowns in there? And then, I think you might have given a schedule or expectation last quarter should -- that we should kind of expect on a go-forward basis.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 27:46 Yes, that's a good question. There was a little bit of accelerated accretion there. That tends to be bumpy. We had -- we're still looking at, oh gosh, probably about $25 million, $30 million of additional accretion as we go through the rest of the year in scheduled. But again, I would anticipate that it's probably going to end up being a little bit more of that simply because of payoffs.\\nMichael Rose: 28:15 Understood. And maybe just finally for me, just two kind of quick housekeeping questions. With the conversion coming in the fourth quarter, I assume a lot of the cost saves will come in and around there. But how much of the cost saves have you realized today? Because I think you targeted 75% for this year. And then just on the one-time cost. Any changes there? I think you had originally estimated $125 million. Any changes there? And how much have you recognized to-date? Thanks.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 28:43 Yes. I don't know that there's any change in any of those numbers just the quick answer there. I think the one-time cost, those are hard for you to see sometimes, because some of those costs were incurred pre-closing on the seller side. So you don't see all of that flowing through. We had a relatively low number this quarter. I would suspect that we will see some increasing cost as we move into the next couple of quarters, because we have some things we've got to spend money forward through that computer conversion in 4Q. But from a cost save perspective, I think we feel like we're in really good shape to hit or exceed the numbers that we put out there. 29:19 You're right. As you're looking out to the back half of the year, the biggest pieces of it will fall off in the fourth quarter, but there's little pieces that have been coming along all the way through. Early on, I said we had converted our mortgage shop all onto the same origination platform early in the year. We're in the process of converting the mortgage servicing onto the same platform here in the not-too-distant future. I mentioned a minute ago that we passed now two pretty big hurdles. We actually upgraded and moved our main processing box just over the past weekend. It puts us in a position to be able to do what we need to do that way. 29:54 And we've also upgraded our card processing all the transactions that flow through on the debit card, credit card side, 100s of 1,000s of transactions a day are flowing through, and that was all upgraded just in the last month. So we're making great progress towards the conversion in the fourth quarter, and I think we're very confident we'll hit our numbers.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 30:14 Yes. The only other thing I would really add to that is, we've incurred about $55 million-ish or so pre-tax, when you look at the fourth quarter, first quarter and then actually looking back at the third quarter of '21, some of that, that was a little bit early. And so as Dan put it, there will be some more. We may end up beating that estimated overall cost.\\nDan Rollins: 30:42 Beating as an coming in less.\\nValerie Toalson: 30:43 Coming in less. It's a good clarification. But again, as Dan said it, there's a lot of activity happening in the latter half of this year.\\nMichael Rose: 30:53 Great. So progress continues. Thanks for taking all my questions.\\nDan Rollins: 30:56 Thanks, Michael. Good to hear from you.\\nOperator: 31:00 The next question is from Brad Milsaps of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDan Rollins: 31:05 Hi, Brad.\\nBrad Milsaps: 31:07 Hi, good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking my questions. Not to continue to belabor the cost name, but just kind of wanted to put a finer point on it, Valerie. It sounded like you said that from the third quarter to the first quarter, your expenses may have -- would have been down maybe $7 million from cost savings. I think you initially identified maybe $20 million quarterly, you're going to spend another $2 million, $2.5 million a quarter kind of on inflationary items. So kind of back of the envelope, would that give you sort of $10 million to kind of fall out of the quarterly run rate, all else equal as you get past the conversion date. Does that math still make sense?\\nDan Rollins: 31:46 Brad, you run that through my brain again.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 31:46 Brad, you run that through my brain again.\\nValerie Toalson: 31:49 Yes. So post conversion, as we look into 2023, we do anticipate achieving all of the cost saves that we laid out in the document. We talked in the announcement, that's $78 million. And then obviously, we have talked about the impact of the $18 per hour is about $10 million per year. And so there's obviously a little bit of puts and takes throughout there. But you can count on us achieving those merger cost saves. We're committed to that.\\nDan Rollins: 32:27 Yes, I think from a big perspective, Brad, when you look at us, I think, we're still very encouraged that the merger gives us the opportunity to not cost out. The wage pressure that we're feeling, that's affecting all of us. That's nothing unique to our company. Everybody is feeling the pressure that's on NSF/OD fees for the industry is impacting all of us not just us. So there are certainly some industry things that are impacting us, but we as a standalone, we think that the ability to bring cost out through our merger is a real positive for us, and we'll meet or exceed probably both sides of those numbers.\\nBrad Milsaps: 33:10 Great. Thank you. And then just as my follow-up, Valerie. Could you talk about maybe plans for the existing remaining liquidity that you have sitting in Fed funds? Do you plan to put that into the bond portfolio with rates higher or just kind of wait and see with what loan growth does. Just kind of curious kind of how to think about the size of the balance sheet and kind of the different categories going forward?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'CADE', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1CADE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Valerie Toalson: 33:34 Yes, absolutely. First quarter is -- has a lot of seasonality on our deposits. We do have a number of large municipal customers, who -- with the tax inflows come in, and then you see those come out in the second quarter. And so part of that liquidity will certainly be to offset some of that volatility and some of that seasonality shift that we will see -- or we anticipate seeing in the second quarter. That obviously using those funds for the loan growth is first and foremost. 34:05 And then it's really going to be effectively what's left over and making sure then that we invest it properly. We do have a lot of cash flow coming off that securities portfolio, about $700 million per quarter. And so that helps fund a whole lot of loans, but also may allow for some reinvestment at some higher rates. Over time, we would like to get the securities book as a percent of assets down as a percent, but that's going to take some time given where we are today.\\nDan Rollins: 34:38 The loan guys need to make more loans.\\nValerie Toalson: 34:39 Absolutely.\\nBrad Milsaps: 34:43 Great.

And it is on one hand you got hurt by rising rates on the AOCI. So it doesn't seem fair to just arbitrarily decide to exclude that. But you got -- it had been your practice or legacy BancorpSouth practice to exclude it when talking about core performance. So I'm just curious about is this a change going forward and how you're going to view it? And what would the puts and takes in deciding to keep that within core earnings? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 35:43 Yes, that's a great question. And you're spot on. I think when we look back over time, when we started pulling that out at legacy BXS, it was a big part of the number. It's become more and more immaterial in our process as we've grown, we've been looking at what peers are doing and what's out there. And so we did pull that out of our adjusted numbers, and we also adjusted the -- adjusted numbers looking backwards, so the -- what you see in the deck is all uniform across. But you're right, we've left it in, because it's a much less material number today than it was when we started adjusting for it as a much smaller organization when we were $10 billion.\\nValerie Toalson: 36:19 And that will be a consistent treatment as we go forward.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 36:23 Okay, okay. Great. And can you just give us a sense for a lot of -- how to view the ACL and where that settles going forward. On one hand, I think the combined -- I think you guys might have given up before that on a combined basis what your day one CECL might have been. But on the other hand, we have a little more uncertainty today just with inflation in geopolitical things. And just wondering how to view that ACL going forward, what we should expect?

       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 37:02 Yes, that's a really good question. It doesn't have a very good answer and you're exactly right, there's a lot of moving parts. The future risk that's out there is the dark cloud that you're looking at history, four quarters in a row of net recoveries would tell you that credit is in really fine shape. But what the future is bringing to us is the unknown, and so to be prepared for that. I don't know that we have a number to tell you where I think it would shake out. But we're certainly watching our modeling, we're making sure we're accounting for the potential risks that are out there.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 37:37 I guess, put it another way. I mean, there's -- I would suspect there's still opportunity for credit leverage for that ratio to come down, but maybe less aggressively than it might have been able to -- or we might have thought a quarter ago?\\nDan Rollins: 37:53 I think that's probably fair. I think, again, the unknown is what's happening in the economy with an inverted yield curve and potential military skirmishes around the world, I think that, that's the unknown and what that does to the economy. That puts the cloud over us without those things, I think your statement would be spot on.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 38:19 Okay. All right.

Good morning, everybody.\\nDan Rollins: 38:35 Good morning, Matt.\\nMatt Olney: 38:37 Most of my questions have been addressed, but I wanted to ask about deposit growth. Yes, it looked good in the quarter, but you mentioned there were some seasonal tailwinds that you guys benefited from. Can you quantify this? Just trying to appreciate if we saw any true sticky deposit growth in 1Q and then kind of the outlook for deposit growth from here?

       " Document(page_content=\"Dan Rollins: 38:58 Yes. So 1Q has historically been the best deposit growth quarter for both of our companies on a standalone. We've not experienced a second quarter as a combined company together yet. So this will be new for us. But second quarter has also been the weakest quarter historically for both of us. So I think the anticipation would be that with the municipal deposits that we were both carrying coming into the merger that we would see similar to what we had seen in the past as standalone entity. So when you look back, I think both of us had seen flat to down deposits in 2Q for the last several years, and I would think that all things being equal, I don't know why it wouldn't be the same this year.\\nMatt Olney: 39:38 Got it. Okay. That's helpful. On the mortgage front, it looked like the percent of production sold was down this quarter around 50%, it had been at 78% range over the last few years. Is this a timing issue? Or just structure you guys choosing to sell less the production and to balance sheet more of that? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 40:04 Yes, nothing has changed from a structure standpoint, there's timing and there's product. So if there's a product mix, we have been retaining the arms on the balance sheet. And so if we're putting more arms or producing more arms, those would stay, but there's been no change in our process. Chris, you want to add in there?\\nChris Bagley: 40:22 Yes, no change. There's probably some noise from the combination of the company. It just hasn't shook out yet as well because both sides are doing mortgages, portfolio mortgages, and we were doing a lot more volume relatively speaking, on the secondary market side. So I think it just takes some time for that to sort of balance itself and see some trends that make sense.\\nDan Rollins: 40:41 And remember, we finished the merger, the consolidation of all of our origination on the one platform in the first quarter.

       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 02:01 Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As most probably saw a few weeks ago, Chris Evans recently joined Axalta, the lead Investor Relations and we're very excited to have him as part of our team. 02:13 With that, I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Let me begin by sharing how proud I am of what we have been able to accomplish this quarter and thank our global team for their hard work. Momentum continues to build in each of our businesses today, because of our team's customer focus and dedication to ensure that we deliver on our goal. 02:37 The entire Axalta team deserves credit for fostering growth and minimizing the financial impact of the various geopolitical crises and the ongoing supply chain challenges. I want to specifically call out our China team where essential management and our manufacturing workforce volunteer to shelter in place at our plants and at our customers plants, throughout the weeks long COVID-19 lockdown to keep operations running and meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for your incredible commitment and resiliency. 03:11 Now to the key first quarter highlights on Slide three. We reported a strong result again this quarter and have a lot to be proud of given the overall environment. Constant-currency net sales growth of 13% exceeded our prior estimate in both Performance and Mobility Coatings. Adjusted EBIT of $120 million achieved the very top-end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was above our guidance range given the flow-through of strong earnings, modest benefits from a lower share count, and a slightly lower adjusted tax rate. I'm pleased with these results given the unprecedented degree of challenges, we had to overcome. 03:52 These include, first, the rapid pace of variable cost inflation, which we experienced across most cost categories and well above what we had factored into our original Q1 guidance construct; second, raw material and labor shortages, which\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"factored into our original Q1 guidance construct; second, raw material and labor shortages, which created a difficult operating environment constraining many customers in our ability to fully serve a healthy consumer demand environment; and finally, direct and indirect impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic issues, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as the effects of zero COVID policies in China. 04:27 Despite the approximately $22 million in earnings headwinds these three items created versus our January guidance framework we were still able to deliver a solid quarter and exceed our sales guidance, as strong pricing and better volumes yielded better-than-expected 10% year-over-year organic ex-FX growth, and also delivered EBIT at the top end of our range. 04:51 Volume improved 1% year-over-year with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, for the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth was supported by ongoing recovery, as well as from share gains that we are driving across the portfolio. These achievements reflect our customers' preference for our differentiated technologies and our nice recognition of the great work from our commercial teams across all of our business lines. Axalta is committed to driving secular growth and we are making encouraging progress, a stronger share position has allowed us to better leverage our fixed cost position driving higher incremental margins, which will serve us well as markets continue to recover the pre-pandemic levels. 05:35 We realized a remarkable 9% price-mix in the quarter, up from a reported 3.6% last quarter, driven by pricing actions that we have continued to implement in order to offset the impact of cost inflation. Both segments have shown strong pricing gains from past quarters with Mobility Coatings reaching record quarterly percent growth. While we are happy with our pricing progress the unprecedented rate of variable cost inflation was driven Q1 profitability well below our historical\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"unprecedented rate of variable cost inflation was driven Q1 profitability well below our historical low-20s percentage adjusted EBITDA margin range. New pricing actions are already underway to offset existing uncovered and anticipated further inflationary costs coming as a result of higher oil prices and tight supply-demand balances in many commodity chains. 06:25 We expect that our margins will begin to recover in the second quarter as we drive further price improvement and enhance our fixed cost leverage position. During the quarter, we also repurchased $175 million in shares. At the current valuation we see tremendous value in our equity and we'll remain opportunistic as we prioritize capital deployment for generating meaningful shareholder return while balancing a conservative balance sheet. 06:51 Moving onto Slide four. Axalta occupies unique and highly profitable positions in the coating industry. We're aligned with mega trends that we believe create a strong growth trajectory for years to come. However, supply chain challenges have drastically impacted global trade, constrained demand and reduced global GDP. Recent geopolitical dynamics have only increased the temporary strain on global operations and worse than short-term visibility. While we continue to have strong conviction in our strategic ambitions and direction, the degree of macro uncertainty today makes it challenging to forecast beyond the near-term with high confidence. Therefore, we're only providing Q2 guidance today. 07:35 Nonetheless I continue to see strong underlying trends. We're launching new innovative products every quarter and each business is making strong progress toward our growth ambition by executing on topline growth. In Refinish our highly profitable industry leading aftermarket Auto Coatings business, the team is delivering on several strategic imperatives. First, increased market access, this quarter we won over 500 net body shops globally and well over 200 new stock point\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"access, this quarter we won over 500 net body shops globally and well over 200 new stock point through distribution customers. Second we're growing our premium market leadership, we are the leader with MSOs, who continued to be allocated more workflow from insurance companies in North America, as well as independent body shops. We are retaining and winning new customers each quarter as we capitalize on our unique customer value proposition. Third, we continue to gain share in mainstream and economy segment, where we haven't had as large of historical presence. 08:38 The addition of new points of distribution is helping to build a sales pipeline in under-represented geographies and markets. We have witnessed good growth progress and execution on all fronts this quarter as evident in our above market volume growth. Another area of focus is the integration of U-POL. We are well underway in integrating the business and executing on cost synergies, but our true enthusiasm for the acquisition is centered around realizing commercial synergies, which we believe will further the U-POL value creation opportunity beyond what we previously communicated. U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in the automotive, body repair business namely in fillers, putties, glazes and aerosols, where Axalta did not participate in a meaningful way. 09:27 Moving into these categories positions us to capture more repair dollars per vehicle. We can also drive commercial synergies through maximizing the cross-selling of Axalta and U-POL products across our global customer base. We're already beginning to see the value creation play out as our distribution partners and key body shop accounts are beginning to stock U-POL products. In addition U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in both consumer and industrial protective coatings. 09:58 In Industrial Coatings, we are driving organic growth in a constrained environment led by strong pricing gains. Industrial price-mix increased by a mid-teens\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"constrained environment led by strong pricing gains. Industrial price-mix increased by a mid-teens percentage year-over-year and by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. A number of additional pricing actions were instituted in late Q1, which should sustain positive pricing momentum into the remainder of the year reporting a return to significantly higher profitability. 10:24 In Mobility Coatings, our industry-leading light-vehicle and commercial OEM business, we secured record pricing gains and outperformed the market from a volume perspective in Q1. Pricing momentum is building every month. While we are negotiating better pricing we are also building a more inflation resilient portfolio by partnering with our customers to increase the percentage of Mobility customer contracts with indexed pricing mechanisms, now between 35% and 40% for the entire segment. 10:56 Recent share gains and light vehicle are driving above market growth and setting us up with the right customer mix -- when global production returns to normalized levels in the future. In commercial vehicle, we continue to hold the leadership position globally in heavy-duty truck market. We are focused on pricing traction to help offset cost inflation and see strong market demand despite customer production constraints. Lastly, we're driving growth across all end markets with innovative and differentiated product offering. Two new exciting product launches just received recognition with the prestigious 2022 Edison Award, which on are some of the most innovative product developments in the world. Our patented Spies Hecker full waterborne repaired system technology was awarded bronze in Edison sustainability category and represents the first paint offering for the collision repair market where all coatings layers from primer to clear coat are water based. 11:59 This is truly sustainable solution provides best-in-class appearance and performance, while reducing solvent emissions by more than 60%.

Next Axalta’s high resolution digital paint coating system won bronze in Edison's material science category. This patent in coating technology supports the mass customization megatrend with a novel coating it can be applied with zero over spray and reduces energy consumption as well as waste generated from the masking process. These are just two great examples of Axalta's innovation pipeline and product differentiation, which we are supporting customers productivity needs in sustainability ambitions, creating a large market pull for our offering. 12:44 Turning to Slide five and six for a discussion of key market and demand trends. Vehicle miles traveled in the United States and Europe have nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but changes in driving behavior, namely the prevalence of work-from-home, seems to have led to lower congestion levels and less collision claims than before the start of the pandemic. Based on paint consumption data from our proprietary e-commerce platform we estimate Q1 body shop activity remained in the mid-80s% and low 90s% respectively for the US and Europe relative to 2019, consistent with the level of collision claims. 13:23 Within the quarter our U.S. body shop customers reported a step-up in activity during March that we believe reflected some modest market improvement though remains constrained by a growing backlog of repair work given parts and labor shortages at the body-shop level. We believe that return to in-person work is an important factor in driving market recovery and are encouraged by U.S. office occupancy, which improved from the low 20s% to 42% versus prior year. 13:55 In Industrial coatings, a healthy demand environment was again limited by supply constraints, namely in Building Products and General Industrial. In total these constraints represented a mid-to-high single digit percent drag against our 1% volume growth in the\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"constraints represented a mid-to-high single digit percent drag against our 1% volume growth in the period. Regionally North America and Asia Pacific contributed most significantly to our year-over-year growth. 14:19 Moving to Mobility Coatings, the expected normalization of global auto production rates in 2022 has been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as China COVID-19 lockdowns, resulting in downward revisions of earlier production estimates. Full-year 2022 global production industry estimates are now forecasted to be 80.6 million, 4% above 2021, but still 9% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. 14:50 Once supply chain constraints and cost headwinds abate the benefit to Axalta will be significant. This is highlighted by an approximately $140 million earnings gap between our trailing 12-month Mobility Coatings Adjusted EBIT and our pre-pandemic 2019 profitability levels, when global auto builds reached 89 million. We're not sitting still and waiting for the market to recover. In the current environment we focus on what we can control, prioritizing productivity, better price to offset cost inflation, and new market gains. Following these actions, we expect to be in an even better position once supply chain constraints diminish and the market recovers. 15:36 In Commercial Vehicle, where we have an industry-leading share in North America and EMEA, strong demand is outpacing constrained production rates. Heavy-duty and medium-duty truck order backlog is now 11-months and eight months, respectively, creating a long-dated growth dynamic for production rates to climb beyond 2022. 15:56 Moving to Slide seven, I’ll cover price cost and our focus on margin recovery. First, I’d like to remind everyone that we have a successful history of managing inflationary periods and quickly recovering loss profitability, our business is resilient. We have the ability to increase price when it's needed. 16:15 From the chart on this slide you can get a sense of the pace of\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"price when it's needed. 16:15 From the chart on this slide you can get a sense of the pace of inflation we have experienced. Even though this inflationary period is uniquely rapid and broad-based, we are already making great progress towards offsetting the impact. 16:28 In Performance Coatings, we have been able to quickly raise price and have offset the majority of the $220 million cumulative year-over-year variable cost and logistics inflation incurred since the second of 2021. In Mobility Coatings, lagging index pricing mechanisms in some contracts, and multi-quarter pricing discussions in others, mean we have begun to accelerate pricing. Every business at Axalta is focused on margin recovery and we expect to cover the majority of existing price cost gaps and incremental headwinds by Q4 of this year at the consolidated level. 17:07 Before I turn the call over to Sean to discuss our financial results, I wanted to touch briefly on some ESG highlights from the quarter on Slide eight. As you may remember we announced our 2030 ESG goals in January, which reflect how meaningful progress in environmental, social and corporate governance is central to Axalta’s strategy and success. We have already begun to execute against these goals and have engaged with many of our customers and other stakeholders to discuss our plans. 17:36 A major commitment is for us to develop new sustainable technologies and increase the proportion of our sales and sustainable solutions. As many of our mobility customers are rapidly shifting to produce more electric vehicles we're aligning our technology to support them and to drive growth in our own business.

       " Document(page_content='Sean Lannon: 18:30 Thanks, Robert, and good morning. As you heard the first quarter delivered strong pricing execution with contributions from across the portfolio. Healthy demand environment supported volume growth, but the continuation of supply constraints was a headwind and also contributed to further challenges from cost inflation. 18:48 Net sales of $1.2 billion increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter, while constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by pricing actions, demand strength across most of our businesses, and benefits from two acquisitions we completed in 2021. 19:05 Constant currency net sales growth included a 19% increase from Performance Coatings and 3% growth from Mobility Coatings, reflecting Light Vehicle up 1% while Commercial Vehicle was up an impressive 10%. First quarter volume improved 1% with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, offset by a low single-digits percent decline in Light Vehicle volumes, which outpaced the approximate 5% decline in global Q1 auto production. 19:34 Price-mix contribution increased 9% in the aggregate, up from our reported 3.6% last quarter, with improvement across all end-markets led by mid-teens improvement in Industrial Coatings. FX translation was a headwind of 3% for Q1, driven by the weaker Euro and Turkish Lira. 19:53 First quarter Adjusted EBIT was $120 million versus $183 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting pricing actions, strong demand, and volume trends across all end-markets except Light Vehicle, which was more than offset by substantial increases in raw material and logistics cost inflation realized versus the first quarter of 2021. I did want to note that we took a $6 million accounting charge associated with accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence reserves, and these are excluded from our adjusted EBIT stemming from sanctions imposed on Russia. 20:28 Turning to Slide 10.

Performance Coatings Q1 net sales increased 15.1% year-over-year and 18.6% ex-FX, driven by 2.5% higher volumes, a 10.7% increase in average price-mix, up from the 4.6% reported last quarter, and a 5.4% increase from acquisitions. 20:50 Refinish reported a 15.6% net sales increase, or 19.7% ex-FX, driven by a high single-digit price-mix benefits, above-market volume growth, and by a high single-digit contribution from the U-POL acquisition. Volumes increased in every region despite raw material supply impacting our ability to meet all of our demand with the exception of China, where COVID-19 lockdowns drove a modest volume decline. 21:17 Industrial Q1 net sales increased 14.5%, or 17.3% ex-FX, driven largely by mid-teens percent improvement in average price-mix, as well as a low single-digit acquisition contribution, and slightly positive volume growth. Demand trends in most of the Industrial end-businesses we serve remained healthy during the period; though supply constraints were a limiting factor, representing a high-single digit percent drag on sales. 21:46 Performance Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $95 million versus $117 million in Q1 2021, driven by ongoing volume growth and drop through benefits of price-mix, which were more than offset by headwinds from higher variable costs. The adjusted EBIT margin for the segment decreased to 11.6% from 16.6% in the prior-year period given the drivers noted. 22:11 Moving to Slide 11. Mobility Coatings net sales increased 3% in Q1 ex-FX, including a 4.9% price-mix tailwind offset by 1.9% lower volumes. The 1.9% volume decreases improved markedly from the 11% decrease last quarter thanks to stronger demand from our customer base, including new business starting to come on line. 22:35 Light Vehicle net sales increased 1% ex-FX in the quarter, including a 3.5% volume decrease, which outperformed a global auto production decline of approximately 5%.

Price-mix also increased mid single-digits. 23:01 Mobility Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $1 million versus $39 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBIT and associated margins in Q1 were impacted by variable cost inflation, with only modest offsets and positive pricing. Pricing gains are accelerating and we expect to cover the majority of incremental variable cost inflation between Q2 and Q4. 23:23 Moving to our debt and liquidity summary on Slide 12. Axalta’s Q1 balance sheet and liquidity profile remained solid. We ended the quarter with slightly over $1.1 billion in total liquidity. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1 times, reflecting an increase from 3.5 times at December 31st. Net leverage remains somewhat elevated due to the seasonal phasing of free cash flow and share repurchases totaling $175 million in the quarter. We continue to expect this to drop as we move to the back end of the year on stronger full-year operating results and normal free cash flow generation. 24:00 On Slide 13, we'll review Q2 guidance and full-year commentary. For the second quarter net sales we expect between 11% and 13% year-over-year growth, including a 4% FX headwinds and a 4% positive M&A contribution. The top line guide assumes low double-digit better pricing, continuing the acceleration of gains we've seen in recent quarters. Our forecast also includes a 2% to 3% sales headwind from China COVID lock-downs and from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 24:33 We expect to generate adjusted EBIT of $135 million to $165 million in the second quarter.

Within our second quarter forecast, we further assume raw material inflation in the high '20s as a percentage versus Q2, 2021. 25:11 As we look for the full-year, it remains challenging to provide a detailed forecast given the degree of supply chain and geopolitical uncertainty. Nonetheless looking ahead, we expect strong mid-teens annual organic growth in both Performance and Mobility Coatings, driven by pricing actions already being executed and volume growth from modest market recoveries and share gains. 25:34 We are encouraged by refinish recovery given improved vehicle miles driven and upward trending office occupancy rates. But we remain measured in our outlook as we monitor the possible impacts from regional and global impacts from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as impacts from the extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China. 25:53 For mobility global auto build rates have been revised lower month-after-month by industry consultants and have settled close to our current 80 million production rate assumption, which is slightly above the 79 million we last forecasted. At these levels, we expect to see annual volume uplift from market growth plus upside from new customer wins. Likewise global medium-duty and heavy-duty truck build rates are projected to increase 4% in 2022, ex-China with our commercial vehicle volumes likely to exceed market rates given our strong and growing positions. 26:28 Regarding cost factors, our current assessment is that rates of overall raw material and cost inflation will continue at high levels.

So I think our expectation continues to be that we'll see the refinish market recover to pre-pandemic levels and we again remain very bullish on that business. 30:32 And I’ve highlight with the acquisition of U-POL we just have a wonderful opportunity to leverage our sales and distribution channels further by pushing additional products and services through existing sales and distribution channel. So that's also an added plus to the secular direction of the refinish business. Within Industrial, very happy to see the strong sequential volume growth, as well as robust pricing gains that led to the 15% sales increase. If we look at some of the markets within Industrial just in the first quarter Building Product sales were, up 22%; Energy Solutions sales were, up 25%; and General Industrial was, up 11% for the quarter versus the prior year. So with that just highlights is that we're executing extremely well against our strategic plan, which was to accelerate growth in Building Products and Energy Solutions and further build out our platform in Energy Solutions, which we'll be talking more about in the future. 31:38 And with regard to Mobility, Mobility showing strong signs of return as we see sequential year-over-year volume improvement.

Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\\nJohn McNulty: 32:44 Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So in the Mobility business you had commented you're about $140 million behind, kind of, where you were pre-COVID. I guess can you help us to understand how much of that is volume driven? And how much of that is price versus raws as you're starting to, kind of, see the acceleration in pricing and starting to catch up, maybe how much of that we can narrow back down even without a recovery in the volumes? I guess, can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 33:14 Yes. John, it's probably 50-50 going back to 2019 levels, we are at 89 million builds. Certainly the controllable right now is catching up on price and clearly you saw that momentum pick up from fourth quarter of the first quarter, you're going to see it again essentially double in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter. But once we get back to sort of that 89 million, 90 million builds, you know, coupled with the fact of pricing traction you're going to see the effect into Chris Parkinson's earlier question, the volumes are camouflage and all the progress we've made from a cost structure perspective, so it's really going to help margins when we get back to those levels.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"John McNulty: 33:53 Got it, got it. No, that makes sense. And then from a capital allocation perspective, so the buyback was kind of off the charts, at least relative to kind of how we were expecting things to play out at least in the quarter. I guess can you speak to how much of that was just the buying opportunity just given how weak the stock had been earlier in the quarter versus how much is around your confidence and the ability to squeeze out more cash as the year goes on to kind of further, kind of, fill up or strengthen the balance sheet and get your kind of, cash flows back on track again? And can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 34:35 The magnitude of the buyout that you saw in the first quarter was really a reflection of how undervalued. We believe our equity was and as we’d always stated we would have a stock repurchase program that would offset dilution, plus an additional few percentage points each year. However, we would remain opportunistic and if we ever really saw a dislocation in the intrinsic value of the company and the equity price that we would step in and step in strongly, and that's what you saw in the first quarter.\\nSean Lannon: 35:07 Yes. And John on your point on cash flow getting back on track. I mean 2020 we did over $440 million, last year we did $455 million. So we've been dropping through cash flow over 50% of EBITDA. So we're happy with the progress we're making, we're confident we're going to delever as long as we don't do anything big on the M&A front. So we're -- again we're being opportunistic given where the share price sits in the first quarter, but we expect the normal seasonality of cash flow build in the back half of 2022.\\nJohn McNulty: 35:37 Got it.

       " Document(page_content=\"Matt Krieger: 35:49 Hi, everyone. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krieger on the line, sitting in for Ghansham. My first question is obviously you delivered results that were ahead of your initial first quarter expectations. But can you talk about some of the key variances relative to your initial guide that drove that? And how those variances have fared as we've moved into early 2Q?\\nSean Lannon: 36:15 Yes. I mean volume was probably the bright spot on the light vehicle side, we had initially assumed 17 million global builds, IHS came in closer to 19.5 million builds and certainly, we benefited from outperforming the actual overall market. We saw volume improvement also within the performance side of the business and then the other bright spot is clearly pricing we were initially expecting around 7% price, we got upwards of 9%, but that has actually offset the impacts that we saw with Russia and the China dynamics, as well as the fact that we saw incrementally about $20 million in variable logistics and variable raw material costs.\\nRobert Bryant: 37:00 Yes, I would just add to what Sean said Matt to the second part of your question regarding April conditions. I think when you look at what we accomplished in the first quarter, it's really impressive, I mean we would have had a blow out quarter had we not had the incremental headwinds and approximately $22 million more in earnings. And I think that's worth noting, but thus far in April top line sales conditions really appear to be similar to what we've seen on -- in the first quarter. And on the cost side, we're seeing oil trade slightly better than our guidance outlook, but the price does remain pretty volatile. So that could be the other variable as we think about the second quarter. We're also closely monitoring the developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation in China, but really at this time April hasn't given us much of a reason to move guidance up or down at this point.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Matt Krieger: 37:56 Great. That's definitely helpful. And then just focusing on the bottom line here, can you provide some added detail on what a realistic timeline for price cost parity across your various business units might look like? And then expanding on that, what level of pricing do we need to see across your portfolio to offset the level of inflation that you're currently experiencing in the high '20s range? Is that mid-teens pricing, high teens pricing, 20% plus pricing flow through. Give us a sense of what we should be looking for from that perspective?\\nSean Lannon: 38:32 So if we hit average oil and there is not a perfect correlation with all the raw material baskets, but if average oil for 2022 is up around $115 per barrel, we're going to need to get almost 10% price to offset exiting 2021, we had roughly at $70 million gap including logistics. We had called out roughly $50 million just raw materials, but we're solving for the full cost stack for the full-year.\\nMatt Krieger: 39:01 Great. That's helpful, thanks.\\nOperator: 39:07 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\\nPJ Juvekar: 39:15 Yes. Hi, good morning, you know, question on your industrial business, you got really good pricing there, volumes were a bit soft due to supply chain issues. So it seems like the underlying demand was still strong, but you had some -- the supply chain issues. But the question on this underlying demand with Europe slowing down with the war and China shut downs recently with COVID, how do you see the underlying demand perform for rest of the year?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 39:46 I think is -- there is a question of underlying demand and then there's a question of what we're able to supply. And just given the mix of raw materials, as well as the overall volume of the Industrial business, that's really the inhibitor, PJ. But if you look at the demand profile of the business, demand was exceptionally strong in North America in particular and we’d again we talk about each one of our unique businesses. We did see Building products, as well as energy solutions grow quite strongly and even Industrial -- general industrial being up being up 11%. Could we see some softness in particular in the general industrial business in Europe, just given some of the pressures there? 40:36 Yes, we could see some softness there, I think it's too early to really tell, but I think the other -- each one of the regions is stronger and each one of the individual industrial segments. So they do kind of balance each other out somewhat. And it's also just important to remember that it's a very highly fragmented customer base, so we are able to increase price. And it does also give us some insulation from some of those macro trends.\\nPJ Juvekar: 41:06 Great, thank you. And can you talk about your battery coatings products for EVs at the PAT level? And what's in the pipeline there? And what would you say your market share is in that business?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",

But we're really one of the top companies in the world when it comes to electric motors in our Energy Solutions business or Energy Solutions Coatings for which we've won multiple Technology Awards they're used in electric motors and vehicles, industrial applications, wind turbines, transmission towers, electrical conduits, but also fuel storage containers, battery trays, closures and covers. And so we have now leveraged our Energy Solutions business to grow into battery cells, battery modules and battery packs. 41:58 Now that being said, we see a much larger opportunity in the global electrification market and we'll be talking about that more in the future.

Robert you mentioned some new wins in Mobility, could you discuss how are you pricing those wins? Are they being done at margins sort of similar to what we see today in the segment? Or some normalized level of how you make sure that there is good return in capital for those new deals?\\nRobert Bryant: 42:51 Sure, at a variable contribution level we've been pricing all of our new business at what we have historically deemed to be attractive levels, and I would say that are reflective of current market conditions. And in particular the business that we have won in China has been at very attractive margins.\\nSean Lannon: 43:12 And Alex just on return on invested capital, I mean, we don't necessarily need to invest additional assets, I mean, we're essentially filling up our plants with the volume.

       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 43:26 I mean that really just your question, I think the increasing sales in Mobility has really been through our technology, our customer intimacy and relationships and frankly our service. And our team in Mobility in particular in Asia has just been doing an outstanding job.\\nAlex Yefremov: 43:46 Thank you, very helpful. Turning to Refinish it sounds like your customers continue to pay shortages of materials and personnel. Do you have any insight weather these issues are getting better not getting better? Or and what could be the pace of improvement here for the rest of the year?\\nRobert Bryant: 44:12 It does still remain an issue for body shops in particular in the U.S., anecdotally we have heard over the last month that it has been getting better, but again I would characterize that is anecdotal as opposed to data driven.\\nAlex Yefremov: 44:29 Got it. Thanks a lot.\\nOperator: 44:34 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nKevin McCarthy: 44:41 Yes, good morning, Robert in your prepared remarks, you referenced company stronger share position and you went on to allude to penetration in the economy segment of Refinish and it sounds like you picked up some share in Mobility. Is there a way to size how much volume uplift you might be enjoying in those businesses or perhaps other businesses where you've gained share relative to underlying market growth?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 45:12 Well, I think we take a look at volume in particular and if we look at volume in the first quarter at least, our volume growth was the strongest in Refinish in particular in North America and Latin America followed by commercial vehicle in EMEA and Latin America. And then industrial in North America and then as we've highlighted our light vehicle business in China. And our penetration, I think would have been even greater of we have had sufficient raw materials. If you think about it, the lack of raw materials is kind of left us with a current backlog in Refinish and Industrial of approximately $50 million, which is about 4% of Q1 sales. So we actually had even more demand and potentially could have had even more share, if we have been able to get our hands on those raw materials. 46:09 So I think the team is doing a great job, not only in the Mobility business, but also in the Industrial business and in Refinish. And in Refinish, as we've highlighted the mainstream in the economy segments have been areas of focus for us and we've made in particular good inroads there in Latin America with a new business model, as well as with China and U-POL only allows us to further leverage that position, because most of U-POL sales and distribution network goes to more mainstream and economy sites, which has allowed us from a cross-selling perspective to more deeply penetrate with our Refinish products, as well as getting our U-POL products into more of our distribution, as well as some of our larger body shops in Europe and in the US.\\nKevin McCarthy: 47:05 And then secondly, if I may, can you comment on what you saw in China in the first quarter in both here in auto and industrial businesses? And what was the trajectory as COVID re-surged in March into early April, curious as to your thoughts on the underlying economy there?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 47:30 I think when you look again at underlying demand in China, demand there has remained really strong. The lockdowns however have made it more challenging to service our customers, but our team there has been doing a great job keeping customers running, even if it's meant living at their sites, which they've voluntarily been doing. So I think we feel really good about what's going on there. On the Mobility side, again, we’ve made some changes from an organizational perspective over the last 18-months, that have really helped us more deeply penetrate the market in particular with Chinese domestics, we've had a pretty significant amount of growth in China. 48:14 And then on the Industrial side, we've also brought in new talent over the past year with very specific domain expertise in the industrial markets that are the largest and play best with our technology portfolio in China and they've also made really, really good inroads. Now in terms of the financial impact as we look at the quarter the COVID-19 lockdowns in China we saw really kind of create a relatively modest headwind in Q1. We expect it to be a little bit more material in Q2 with the shutdowns, so the April results we expect to be most impacted as the lockdowns are kind of in full swing in Shanghai. But we expect the business should start to normalize in May, unless we see COVID spread to other areas and then our guidance assumption is kind of, if there is a full return to normal operations in June. If the lockdowns are lifted. So again all of that depends on the trajectory of where we go from here. Again as a reminder, China is about 10% of our annual sales and we've assumed about a 1.5 month impact in the second quarter.\\nKevin McCarthy: 49:34 That's really helpful.

Just wanted to get a little more insight into the 35% to 40% of the index pricing, you have now, which is up from prior indication. Where are you looking to get that figure? And what is it that's driving those customers onto those contracts versus the ones that are staying often. Is it new folks that are coming in where you have new wins? Or is it you're converting existing customers or both. And as a follow-up to that, just when we get to a period of deflation, which hopefully eventually we will get to presumably those contracts will automatically reset on some timeframe, but then you'll be looking to hold on to price in the balance of the business. Maybe just wanted to sort of get some insight into that interplay?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 50:39 The optimal level of -- I’d say the optimal level of index contracts is difficult to say, it's really more of a customer preference. There are some customers that prefer to have an index contracts in place, it just makes the amount of time that we as well as our customers spend on price negotiations, run a lot more smoothly every, every customer is different and every purchasing organization within each OEM is different, some prefer not to have an index contracts and just to have price negotiations verbally. So it's really more a function of what our customer preferences are. 51:19 Most of the contracts on average have about a six-month adjustment. So for example, July 1st we'll see an adjustment to the majority of the index contracts that will start to see that flow through at the beginning of the third quarter. And then likewise, if you were to see raw material prices come down, you would see those prices come down six months later. I think the important element to emphasize there is the through cycle profitability and so as we've structured these arrangements with our customers, we have tried to put them through the mid-point of the cycle on attractive level of profitability for us, which we think we've achieved in terms of how we've structured those contract. And in particular, you know, versus the amount of value that we actually create for our OEM customers, which as you know is quite substantial.\\nVincent Andrews: 52:13 And then maybe just a follow-up on U-POL, I think you've had the business since September and obviously it's been a tricky time with raw materials and pricing. Have they been able to be as nimble as you've wanted them to be? Or if you had to come in with best practices or just how is pricing going with the acquisition?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",

On the cost side, we only had roughly $10 million of synergies, we're well on track. We have targeted 12 to 18-months on that front. So we're in good shape on the cost side. As far as the commercial synergies and Robert covered this a bit in his prepared remarks but we're making really good progress as far as integrating their commercial teams and really driving those efforts and actually seeing the progress. The expectation pre-all the additional pricing we are expecting to do high-teens as far as growth rates and slightly higher than that from an EBITDA perspective. With the additional pricing, we expect to be north of that, but I would characterize U-POL very similar to the overall Refinish with good pricing hour and we’ll make good progress on that front.\\nVincent Andrews: 53:23 Great, thank you very much.\\nOperator: 53:27 Thank you.

In terms of mobility you -- at the 80.6 million auto build outlook that you have for ’22, is there good improvement in the second half? Is pricing catches up? Or are we still sort of at this breakeven point given you gave us an outlook for the auto build?\\nSean Lannon: 53:54 Yes, we will be making steady progress as we work through the year. We're expecting volumes to continue to pick up sequentially, coupled with the fact that pricing will start to outpace that the COGS inflation rates.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",

And then yes, no just as a quick follow-up on the business, there's not a lot of businesses I don't think that are kind of losing money in Coatings and I think that's probably for everybody. But is this a good business for Axalta longer term given how cyclical it's been. I understand it's been kind of weird unprecedented times, but when you think about where you could redeploy potentially and I know timing is a bad? Is this something that you should hold onto or maybe the vast at some point and then invest in things in Performance Coatings, which is held up a lot better?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'AXTA', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1AXTA'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 54:50 I think to answer your question, we have to look at kind of the moment in history that we are right now, which is fairly, fairly unprecedented. I think if you take COVID and then on top of COVID, you ask -- you add massive cost inflation and then you add a semiconductor shortage and then on top of that, you add supply chain issues. It does create a rather unique point in history that we would certainly hope would never be repeated. As we think about the business over the longer term again, we think that over the next five years once those conditions ameliorate, we are going to see secular demand that is going to make this business an extremely strong performer within our portfolio. The lack of inventory at OEMs at dealer life, the need of car rental companies to replenish their fleets, there's just a tremendous amount of secular demand. 55:51 In addition to the continued conversion from Ice vehicles to electric vehicles where we have additional content per vehicle that will also be an impetus and is the business changes in works, we also have some additional technologies, as well as some additional areas of market focus that we think are going to even improve potentially the margin profile of the business to that of a higher level than sort of the 2016, 2017 period. So again, as far as Light Vehicle we do remain positive on that business. It's just a tough point in time when you have this many exogenous variables go against you.\\nSean Lannon: 56:32 And Mike, I just -- I did want to call out one point, because I think some folks lose sight of this, light vehicle is still EBITDA positive. EBIT has been impacted by all the depreciation and amortization from the carve-out from DuPont back in ’13, but it's still is generating cash and I did want to highlight that point.\\nMike Sison: 56:51 Got it.

       " Document(page_content=\"Mike Leithead: 57:02 Great, thanks, good morning guys. Just one from me, I wanted to circle back to John's earlier question on the buyback. Robert, you obviously talked about finding great value in your equity price in 1Q. And when I just look at your current share price, it's maybe I don't know 10-ish percent below your average acquired price in 1Q? So should we expect healthy buybacks to continue into 2Q here?\\nSean Lannon: 57:26 So we're not providing discrete guidance on that. I think we're going to remain opportunistic, we also are keeping an eye on M&A activities, as well as deleveraging over time. But it's certainly on the agenda that continue to look at.\\nMike Leithead: 57:44 I guess maybe a different way to come at it we have your average 1Q share diluted count. What did the quarter end that, I'm just trying to back into your 2Q shares outstanding guidance there? Thanks.\\nRobert Bryant: 57:59 So we acquired 6.4 million shares, we got roughly a $4 million diluted average benefit in the first quarter and we're expecting Q2 guide to be at $2.22. I'm not sure if I answered your question precisely, there.\\nMike Leithead: 58:17 No, I think that's helpful. We can follow-up offline. Thank you.\\nOperator: 58:22 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\\nLucas Beaumont: Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. I just wanted to go back to the contract re-pricing in Light Vehicle if we could. So could you tell us sort of roughly how much of your contracts have sort of been repriced already today?

       " Document(page_content=\"Robert Bryant: 58:46 The way to think about that is that the contracts vary and linked between three and four years. So in any given year there is about 25% to 33% of the contracts that are coming up for quote or for rebidding. So you have an built-in price adjuster of about a quarter of the business at least kind of every year as business is rebid and requited. The other element to keep in mind is that the color palette of all so as you might have a given vehicle platform is there is a color change? Of course, you'll be repricing those colors at current economics.\\nLucas Beaumont: 59:29 Great, thanks. And then, so just thinking about if mobility markets going to fail to improve or end up remaining like a strain for a number of additional quarters. Do you guys have any like contingency plans, where you would think about taking any temporary or sort of permanent cost actions. I guess how meaningful could that be? Or it gives you more, you would just wait it out until we sort of get through it? Thanks.\\nSean Lannon: 59:58 So at this point, you know, over the last two years, we've done a fair amount of reductions both structural, as well as holding on the -- some of the temporary savings. So unless we saw a significant demand destruction, I think we're in a pretty good place, right now it's just to focus on price. And I think what you're going to see in the second quarter is a nice uptick and price realization to continue to help our margins.\\nOperator: 60:28 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

We reported net income today of $1.80 per share in the first quarter compared to net income of $1.94 per share for the same period last year. 02:01 Results for 2021 include a $0.09 per share benefit related to severe cold weather event in February last year. Setting that aside, financial results in 2022 were driven by new rates in Washington and customer growth, as well as continued growth in expenses as we invest in our natural gas utility system. 02:21 We also see positive momentum in our local Portland Metro area economy, the strong labor market helped to drive unemployment down to near historic lows. Unemployment rates in Oregon declined to 3.8% in March 2022, compared to 6.1% a year ago. Single-family housing activity remains robust. The average sales price of a home was up over 10% for the first quarter of March 2022 compared to last year. Single-family permits issued were up almost 3% in Oregon through February 2022, compared to the prior period. Construction and development remained robust in our region. 02:59 We continue to see a healthy pipeline of conversions to natural gas in single-family homes. In the last 12 months, 2,200 customers have converted in our service territory. These conversions, along with new construction translated into nearly 11,000 customers connected to our gas system during the last 12 months. That equates to a growth rate of about 1.4%. 03:21 Our water and wastewater utilities also continue to grow. Strong residential housing construction primarily in Idaho and Texas translated into a 3.1% organic customer growth rate over the last 12 months ended March 31. The combination of this organic growth and acquisitions resulted in a 27% increase in our water utility connections. 03:43 Turning to our', metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"and acquisitions resulted in a 27% increase in our water utility connections. 03:43 Turning to our decarbonization activities. We continue to make progress under the landmark Oregon Senate Bill 98 legislation which supports renewable energy procurement and investment by natural gas utilities. In January this year, Northwest Natural reached an important milestone as the first RNG facility with Tyson Foods and BioCarbN began operations. Northwest Natural is the first local gas distribution utility in the Continental United States to invest in and own an RNG facility on behalf of all of its sales customers as we work to decarbonize our gas portfolio. 04:21 Construction of our second facility has begun with commission slated for early 2023. To date, we signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG on behalf of our customers, totaling about 3% of Northwest Natural's current annual sales volume in Oregon. I am very proud of the progress we've made in less than two years. To put that into perspective, today wind and solar account for about 12% of our nation's electric supply, after decades of investment. In March we also interconnected an RNG facility in Eugene, Oregon to our system. We're excited to keep flowing renewables through our own pipeline system here in Oregon. 05:01 Reflecting our dedication to decarbonization, Northwest Natural was recently made an environmental champion among 140 of the largest utilities in a national study by Escalent. I'm proud of our customers' recognition of our dedication and leadership in this area and thank them greatly. 05:18 With that, let me turn it over to Frank to cover the financials of the quarter.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Frank Burkhartsmeyer: 05:21 Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing the highlights of the first quarter of 2022 results and conclude with guidance for the year. I'll describe the earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. 05:36 As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of the revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months. 05:45 For the quarter, we reported net income of $56.2 million or $1.80 per share compared to net income of $59.5 million or $1.94 for the same period in 2021, a decline of $0.14 per share. The decrease in net income largely reflects the $2.8 million or $0.09 per share benefit of the February 2021 cold weather event. The gas utility posted a $0.01 per share increase in earnings, while results from our other businesses declined $0.15 per share. 06:16 Higher earnings at the gas utility were primarily related to new rates in Washington, customer growth and an improvement in the results from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as the prior year included the effect of purchasing higher-priced gas during the February weather event. As a result of these factors, utility margin increased $3.7 million. 06:36 Utility O&M increased $3.5 million, reflecting higher levels of expense from payroll, contractor and professional services and IT upgrades. Utility depreciation and general taxes increased $900,000 due to higher property, plant and equipment as we continue to invest in our system. Other income increased $1.9 million, driven by lower pension costs. Net income from our other businesses decreased $4.7 million as the prior period benefited from higher asset management revenues related to the cold weather event. 07:08 For 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $141 million, an increase of $4 million compared to last year. We invested $70 million into the business, most of which was for gas\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",

The company reaffirmed 2022 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations. We continue to target our long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6%. 08:01 With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"David Anderson: 08:04 Thanks, Frank. We continue to progress and execute on our business strategy. Our focus is maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated gas utilities and positioning our business for incremental long-term growth by investment in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas business. 08:21 In addition to moving our gas utility towards a renewable future, last year we also launched a competitive renewable natural gas strategy. We're committed to leading in the energy transition and providing renewable natural gas to the utility, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors. We're focused on providing cost-effective solutions to help these sectors decarbonize, while existing waste streams and renewable energy sources were using the existing waste streams and renewable energy sources. 08:51 As you know, we've already taken our first steps with the 20-year RNG supply agreement and a total of $50 million committed investment in two RNG facilities. Construction has begun on both of those facilities and we expect them to be placed into service in early 2023. At the end of January, Mike Kotick joined our team to lead our competitive RNG efforts. In just a few short months, Mike has hired additional members to the RNG team who comes with significant RNG experience. The team is fully engaged, pursuing incremental opportunities and putting the final touches on the business plan. We'll share more details on that in the coming months. 09:28 Turning to our water and wastewater utility businesses. As previously mentioned, in December 2021 we signed our largest acquisition to date to acquire Far West Water and wastewater utilities in Yuma, Arizona, a very fast-growing region which currently serves approximately 25,000 customers. We've met with all the Arizona utility commissioners and look forward to working closely with them in SAP. In March, we submitted the application for approval of the transaction to the Arizona Commission.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",

We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year and it to be accretive to earnings per share after its first full year of operations. 10:05 In the first quarter, we also announced additional agreements to acquire two water utilities near our existing systems in Texas. We remain excited about the investment potential for this business and we look forward to more announcements soon. And finally, this morning I'm proud that Northwest Natural Holdings being named one of 2022's World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere.

Our first question for today comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America.\\nDavid Anderson: 11:32 Good morning.\\nKody Clark: Hey, good morning, David and Frank. This is Kody Clark on for Julien. Thanks for the time. So first, curious if you can share more on what you're seeing with the current inflationary backdrop? And specifically, how much is expected as it relates to the IT program for '22 versus some other pressures that we've seen with the backdrop?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 11:57 Hello, good morning, Kody, it's Frank. Yes, I wouldn't -- I don't want to describe the O&M change that you're seeing as inflationary. It's really an effort that we're making right now. A lot of that impact is coming from some investments that we're having to make in IT. And part of that is taking on some cloud arrangements which flows through O&M now. That's a fair piece of that. The rest of it is salary and benefits are up. I wouldn't call that inflationary. We didn't see a huge, say, extraordinary change in our salary and benefits year-over-year. And then we also have a little bit more business development. We're doing RNG now, it's in a competitive market as well as the water business. 12:39 So, you kind of have those three things and then just your ordinary -- the business is growing. This is why we filed the rate case or a big part of it year-over-year. Just we knew this growth was coming. I will say though that the first quarter shows a bigger change, if you looked at a percentage, probably almost double what we would expect for the full year. So we expect O&M to grow this year. Nothing unusual there. But in the first quarter, there's a little bit of a timing impact that makes the first quarter versus the first quarter last year look a bit higher. So that will normalize as the year plays out.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Kody Clark: 13:13 Understood. Got it. And on regulated RNG, you're at 3% of volumes. But as we think about the caps in '25 and beyond, how should we be thinking about your ability to rebate investments versus just offtake? So what's the difference in customer costs, if any? And any data points or color there that you can point to would be helpful.\\nDavid Anderson: 13:37 Yes. Kody, I think the number one thing that you -- that everybody should understand is, we're going to do all we can to decarbonize as much of our product as we can under Senate Bill 98 and that will be through -- it could be through investments or it could be through just direct purchases, whatever is in the best interest of our customers. And right now, we've done that and we've done it through a rate base investment with the Tyson opportunity that I referenced in my prepared remarks and then we've also got purchase agreements. 14:04 So I expect more coming down as we continue to progress and hopefully, it reaches close to the limit of Senate Bill 98 as quickly as we possibly can. So it's a little hard right now to say X amount will come from rate base, X amount will come from purchases. Again, we'll do what is in the best interest of our customers, which I believe going forward will be a combination of both.\\nKody Clark: 14:29 Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze it in on competitive RNG. And you mentioned potentially getting some additional announcements here. But wondering if there's any timing that you can point to? Is it a matter of getting those first projects under your belt and in service in early 2023 before committing to anything incremental or could we see some additional announcements sooner?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",

I'm really pleased with the progress that Mike has made with his team of getting the team established. There's already incremental opportunities that we're looking at and it's one of the reasons when we came out with the strategy late last year that we raised our earnings growth guidance from the 3% to 5% through 4% to 6% because we do see additional opportunities here that will help the company grow faster than it would without that. 15:21 So more details to come in the coming months but you're right, Kody, I think we need to do some more transactions and then we'll be a little bit more descriptive when those transactions happen. And some of those can be development, some of them could be contract purchases and we market them, there's various options that Mike is working through with the team right now.\\nKody Clark: 15:41 Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks so much for the time, and good luck.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 15:45 You bet. Thank you.\\nOperator: 15:49 Thank you.  Our next question for today comes from Selman Akyol from Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nSelman Akyol: 16:02 Thank you. Good morning. Just staying with renewables. Was there any update on hydrogen? I mean, we're just starting to hear more about it.

Nikki, why don't you kind of give an indication of what we're working on?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Nikki Sparley: 16:18 Sure. We have a couple of efforts that are active right now. One of them is continuation of our work with the Eugene Electric Utility to develop a hydrogen blending project in Eugene, where we're at there is we have an engineer and an equipment consultants working on finishing the project plan. We also hired a consultant to do a system audit. It's a readiness audit in that site and where we're going to be blending in that area that helps us understand hydrogen readiness for all our pipes and components and meters. 16:55 And we expect that work to be done in July and then we'll be wrapping on that into a potential filing under Senate Bill 98 here in Oregon, along with securing potentially other funding from a clean energy fund in the United States. The other thing that we're doing is continuing our hydrogen blend cap at our Sherwood facility in Oregon. We've been blending about 5% hydrogen in a section of that facility for about 1.5 years, testing end-use applications, furnaces, water heaters, fireplaces. 17:35 Our 2022 goals are to step up that blend to a 24/7 operation with a ramp-up at a 15% blend and 5% increment through this year, of course, subject to performance, both in our system and on the end-use equipment. And we're looking at other opportunities with hydrogen in our area and nationally partnering with other groups. The application that I mentioned for the Eugene project with the -- under that Senate Bill 98, that is legislation that was passed several years ago in Oregon that allows natural gas utilities to apply for spending on projects that reduce emissions that would otherwise not be cost-effective. 18:24 So it's an avenue that we have to work collectively with the EWEB Electric Utility. And I'm sorry, it's SD844, I said 98, I apologize, that's our RNG legislation. But a lot of activity and you're right, we're hearing a lot of interest in hydrogen and we're working hard on it ourselves.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'NWN', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1NWN'}),\n",

Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there and maybe your pipeline and just how pricing is going or is there upward pressure on the systems that you're seeing in terms of pricing or is it sort of in line with what you've been doing?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 19:21 Yes.

We continue to see a robust set of opportunities in pipeline in the water space. It is competitive and there are a number of players out there that are also pursuing opportunities. That competition varies a little bit depending on the specific market. But we are pleased with the progress we've been making and we see a fairly robust pipeline of opportunities going forward. We will continue to tuck-in smaller acquisitions around our existing service territories and we're working hard on investing in the existing utilities that we own. We actually just completed a couple of rate cases this last quarter with new rates in effect May 1 in both -- one of our Oregon subsidiaries and one of our Washington subsidiaries. 20:20 So things are going well there.

This morning, we released our fiscal twenty twenty two first quarter financial results, which showed strong sales growth and profitability. Even in this challenging environment caused by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 virus and the associated inflation and logistical challenges, the Brady team once again performed quite well. I'm proud of how the team was able to navigate this challenging economic environment and deliver for both our customers and our shareholders. 02:08 This quarter, we grew sales by a very healthy sixteen percent and we increased earnings per share by four point seven percent. If you exclude the impact of amortization, then our EPS was up even more significantly at nine point one percent. In addition to this solid revenue and earnings growth, we have a rock solid balance sheet. This quarter we returned more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, and we are still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 02:41 In our WPS business, sales were down by seven point eight percent. This sales reduction was almost exclusively the result of very challenging comparables. Last year, our WPS team did an excellent job of providing COVID-related products to our customers. The sale of these products, which included social distance signage and personal protective equipment has since waned, thus resulting in challenging comparables. The best way to look at our WPS business is to compare sales to the pre-COVID period of fiscal twenty twenty, which would show that our current sales levels exceeded those historic pre-COVID levels. 03:24 In our Identification Solutions business, we continue to post excellent results, with sales growth of twenty five point four percent and segment profit growth of twenty one point two percent.

Our Identification Solutions business is a very strong franchise and continues to perform extremely well. As we look ahead, our priorities are the first to drive organic sales growth and ensure we are serving our customers extremely well during this period of challenging logistics. Second, it is to take the necessary cost and pricing actions to offset the impacts of this inflationary environment and return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels. Third, is to integrate our recent acquisitions. And finally, to deploy our capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 04:28 In our ID Solutions business, we're embracing these priorities by increasing our investments in R&D, including the incremental R&D necessary to fully realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions. We are certainly seeing benefits from our historical R&D focus as we're launching new products at an increasing rate and we're continuing to distance ourselves from our competitors, who neither have the scale nor financial wherewithal to invest as heavily in R&D. 04:57 We're also improving our online presence by upgrading our websites and investing more in digital marketing talent all while expanding our sales force and expanding geographically into underserved markets. We're driving significant automation enhancements within our factories and distribution centers, which in a period marked by scarcity of labor and rising costs, this continuous push to drive automation is critical. 05:24 Our strong new product line-up, investments to drive sales and our positive momentum in driving efficiencies give us confidence that our ID Solutions business will continue to generate strong organic sales growth with very healthy margins in fiscal twenty twenty two and beyond. 05:43 In our Workplace Safety business, we are capitalizing on our common web platform by using our\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",

We've increased our investments to new product development and the pace of new product launches in an effort to increase the percentage of proprietary high value products sold to our customers, which will have a positive impact on our profit margins. 06:08 And we're intensely increasing our advertising spend and our headcount in certain businesses that have lagged in an effort to drive future revenues. These investments resulted in reduced segment profit this quarter, but will result in increased revenues as we progressed throughout the fiscal year. 06:27 Our Workplace Safety business is headed in the right direction. And I'm confident that the changes we've been implementing and the investments we've been making will help drive long-term sales and profit growth. While we're investing in organic sales, we're also working to streamline our SG&A cost structure, so that we can fund our sales growth initiatives while still driving down SG&A expense and we're focused on becoming a more efficient manufacturer by automating wherever we can. 06:57 In addition to our focus on driving organic sales growth and becoming a more efficient organization, we are also actively integrating the three acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter last year, which includes building out our industrial track and trace solution set. Much of the increased R&D that you see relates to the investments necessary to build out a comprehensive solution that will help move us into faster growing end markets and accelerate sales growth for years to come. 07:25 I'm confident we'll continue to see revenue growth in future quarters.

Even with these inflationary pressures, our gross profit margin was still an enviable forty eight point two percent, which was right in line with the forty eight point two percent experience in the fourth quarter of last year. But our cost increases have neither been large enough nor fast enough to fully keep up with rising costs, resulting in our gross margins being down around seventy basis points and year-over-year basis. 08:27 As such, we're putting through additional price increases across many of our product lines to try to catch up with the rapidly increasing costs. We believe that these gross margin challenges are temporary and that in the near term, we will return to our historical gross margin levels of close to fifty percent. Even with this challenging logistical environment, Brady is well-positioned as we look to the rest of this fiscal year and beyond.

Sales in the first quarter were three hundred and twenty one point five million dollars, which was an increase of sixteen percent when compared to the same quarter last year and GAAP pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent to forty four point seven million dollars. 09:37 Impacting earnings this quarter was a significant increase in amortization expense from the acquisitions completed at the end of last year. If you exclude amortization expense from all periods presented, and our pre-tax earnings would have increased by eleven point three percent to forty eight point five million dollars. 09:57 GAAP diluted EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars, which was an increase of four point seven percent over last year's first quarter. And if you exclude amortization expense, then EPS would have increased by nine point one percent to zero point seventy two dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty six dollars in the first quarter of last year. So, financially, Q1 was another strong quarter even with the logistical challenges and the inflationary pressures that Michael just mentioned. 10:27 Moving to slide number four, you will find our quarterly sales trends. Our sixteen percent sales increase consisted of organic sales growth of seven percent, an increase from acquisitions of eight point three percent, and an increase from foreign currency translation of zero point seven percent. 10:44 Organic sales growth in our ID Solutions business was a robust thirteen point two percent in Q1. Our Workplace Safety business benefited from strong COVID-related product sales in last year's first quarter thus creating tough comparables.

And if you compare sales by division, you'll see that Identification Solutions is fifteen point six percent above pre-pandemic levels and Workplace Safety is one point two percent above pre-pandemic levels. 11:35 This strong performance not only against last year, but also against the pre-pandemic period is a direct result of the investments that we've been making and the strong sales momentum that we developed just before the pandemic hit. 11:47 Turning to slide number five, you'll see our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was forty eight point two percent this quarter compared to forty eight point nine percent in the first quarter of last year. As Michael mentioned, we're seeing inflationary pressures and we're finding it difficult to fill open manufacturing roles. But we're automating wherever we can, we're driving efficiencies at a strong pace and we're putting it through targeted price increases. 12:14 On slide number six, you will find our SG&A expense trending. SG&A was ninety six point seven million dollars this quarter compared to eighty three million dollars in the first quarter of last year. SG&A was heavily impacted by a full quarter of expense from the three acquisitions completed near the end of last year along with the increase in amortization expense that I just mentioned. 12:36 Amortization expense was one point four million dollars in the first quarter of last year and was three point eight million dollars in the first quarter of this year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was thirty point one percent this quarter compared to thirty point zero percent in the first quarter of last year. So, effectively, right in line with the prior year.

However, if you exclude amortization expense from both the current year and the prior year, then SG&A would have declined from twenty nine point five percent of sales last year to twenty eight point nine percent of sales this year. 13:11 Slide number seven is the trending of our investments in research and development. This quarter, we invested thirteen point nine million dollars in R&D. We're committed to increasing our R&D investments as we continue to see opportunities for incremental R&D within our core business and specifically in building out a comprehensive industrial track and trace platform that encompasses our printers, high quality materials, RFID scanners, and barcode scanners. These investments in R&D are critical to help propel Brady's long-term sales growth and protect our gross profit margins. 13:45 Slide number eight illustrates our pre-tax income trends. Pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent on a GAAP basis and increased eleven point three percent, if you exclude amortization expense from all periods. 13:59 Slide number nine illustrates our after-tax income and EPS trends. As I mentioned, our GAAP EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty four dollars in last year's first quarter, an increase of four point seven percent. And if you exclude the after-tax impact of amortization, our EPS would have increased by an even stronger nine point one percent. 14:21 On slide number ten, you'll find a summary of our cash generation. We generated twenty seven point five million dollars of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow was sixteen point two million dollars this quarter. Our underlying cash flow was strong, but we intentionally invested in both inventories as well as capital expenditures.

This quarter, we also continued to increase inventories as we've been intentionally prioritizing customer service and product availability over trying to optimize inventory levels and risk running out of critical materials. Over the last six months, we've increased our inventories by approximately thirty million dollars. 15:16 Now if you'll turn to slide eleven, you can see the impact that Brady's historically strong cash generation has had on our balance sheet. Even after returning more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, having heightened CapEx and intentionally increasing inventory levels, on October thirty one, we were still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 15:40 Our strong balance sheet puts us in a fantastic position to execute additional value-enhancing activities, including investing in R&D, completing additional acquisitions, and returning funds to our shareholders. Our approach to capital allocation has not changed and has been serving us well. 15:59 First, we use our cash to fully fund organic sales and efficiency opportunities throughout the economic cycle. This includes investing in new product development, sales generating resources, IT improvements, capability enhancing capital expenditures and CapEx to further automate our facilities. We will also -- we will absolutely keep funding these investments where it makes sense and where the investments are ROI positive. 16:27 And second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends.

Our full year diluted earnings per share guidance, excluding amortization, remains unchanged at a range of three point twelve dollars to three point thirty two dollars per share. On a GAAP basis, our full year diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged at a range of two point ninety dollars to three point ten dollars per share. 17:25 Included in our GAAP earnings per share guidance is an increase in after-tax amortization expense of approximately six million dollars. After-tax amortization increases from about five point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty one to about eleven point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty two, which is a delta of about zero point twelve dollars per share. 17:46 As we look at stagging throughout the rest of this fiscal year, we anticipate our short term gross profit margin challenges to persist throughout our fiscal second quarter and history shows that our second quarter is seasonally our lowest quarter of the year and generally has earnings per share below that of Q1. 18:05 As we move beyond the second quarter, we expect to see increased benefits from our pricing actions as well as the increased benefits from our many efficiency and automation projects. As a result, we continue to expect that the majority of our earnings per share growth will come in the third and fourth quarters of this year. 18:23 We also expect total sales growth to exceed twelve percent for the full year ending July thirty one, twenty twenty two which is inclusive of both organic sales growth as well as sales growth from the recently completed\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",

IDS sales increased twenty five point four percent to two hundred and forty eight point six million dollars. This very robust sales growth is comprised of organic growth of thirteen point two percent, acquisition growth of eleven point six percent and an increase of zero point six percent from foreign currency translation. 20:20 Organic sales in our IDS division were once again very strong, not only versus the first quarter of last year, but also against previous sequential quarters. And on the cost side, our strong focus on sustainable efficiency gains partially offset the input cost increases that we've been experiencing. 20:39 Segment profit as a percentage of sales was nineteen point six percent, which was down from twenty point three percent last year. However, if you exclude the sizable increase in amortization that Aaron mentioned, then segment profit as a percentage of sales would have increased from twenty one percent of sales to twenty one point one percent of sales, so an increase of about ten basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. 21:07 Regionally, organic sales in Asia were strong this quarter with growth of over fifteen percent compared to the first quarter of last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of Asian organic sales growth in excess of 10%. Organic sales were also up more than fifteen percent in EMEA, despite several lockdowns continuing throughout most of the first quarter. Our European team once again did an excellent job driving sales growth while handling the period interruptions caused by the lockdowns. 21:39 We also had organic sales growth of nearly twelve percent in the Americas.

And although, we are probably a full two years away from having a complete track and trace solution, we've already been experiencing very nice synergies from our recent acquisitions and we expect these sales synergies to only increase from here on out due to the complementary nature of our product portfolios and the more complete product offerings that Code, Magicard and Nordic ID bring to Brady. 22:36 These acquisitions are performing slightly better than expected and bring us valuable technologies that help us round out our product offerings and make Brady more valuable to our customers. Clearly, we're devoting a significant amount of time and money to our track and trace product offerings, but we are not sacrificing R&D investments in other areas such as printers and materials. 23:00 We continued our steady stream of new printer introductions by launching the J4300 Brady Jet Label Printer. This inkjet printer combines with Brady’s high efficiency proprietary materials to balance the safety and complexity of compliance labels with the demands of industrial environments. 23:21 Our industrial inkjet printers save our customers time by quickly and easily creating compliant, long lasting photo quality labels, signs and tags that are needed to create a safer, more efficient workplace.

WPS sales decline seven point eight percent, which consisted of an organic sales decline of eight point six percent and an increase from foreign currency of zero point eight percent. This sales decline was primarily driven by challenging comparables to last year's first quarter. 25:11 Our WPS business performed extremely well and supplied our customers with a great deal of COVID-19 related products during the pandemic last year and the demand for these types of products has declined substantially since then. Our WPS sales were seventy two point nine million dollars this quarter, which were above the pre-pandemic sales experienced in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty. 25:38 Even in these challenging times with periodic shutdowns, our European WPS team did an outstanding job of increasing its customer base.

The sale of COVID-related products declined in North America as well this quarter and this decline was not fully offset by our non-COVID product offerings, thus leading to a decline in organic sales in the Americas. 26:46 And as I alluded to earlier, we've made investments to improve certain of our lagging businesses in WPS, including our business in the U.S. that primarily serves micro businesses. We've incurred start-up costs to open a new facility in the U.S. We've invested in head count, and we're also investing in additional advertising. All in, these incremental investments were approximately two point five million dollars. 27:12 These investments negatively impacted WPS' profitability this quarter, but we believe that these investments are critical to return our WPS business to sustainable long-term profitable growth. In addition to these investments, our WPS business also experienced gross margin compression as a result of raw materials, freight and wage inflation as I mentioned. 27:36 Similar to our IDS business, we're taking actions to offset these cost increases.

We are working hard to really change the profile of WPS in a significant and meaningful way.

We believe that we have a value-add equation there that is unique in the marketplace as we execute these changes. It is going to take time. We are already down that path. We're excited about what we see from that. But this is not a quick situation and they have also been plagued more significantly than IDS, in that, A, a much larger percentage of their products are brought in, and B, a much larger percentage of their products come from Asia. So, they have a both logistical and cost pressures there. So, we absolutely see more short-term difficulties in that business, but we do believe that it is a business that overall, we can continue to provide significant shareholder value over the long term. That said, I want to be clear on all of our businesses, we evaluate our portfolio. We have in the past looked at some businesses that didn't make sense putting into our portfolio. We will continue to do that.

We do think will last for eighteen to twenty four months, that is not a guarantee of timing, but it is our latest belief and our continued latest belief on how this will impact things. 34:01 What that means is product sets, even in IDS that are more dependent, we have those on Asian imported products are dealing with much larger sourcing difficulties and also timing difficulties. We have made a lot of proactive steps. I know for a fact that in many ways we're able to service our customers better than our competition today and it is our goal to continue to do that. 34:29 But as far as pruning products, we look at that regularly. Throughout my tenure at Brady, we've pruned a number of products and continue to look at that cycle, and make sure we're offering our customers the best and the brightest.

Those are absolutely one-time costs. We are careful and as you know, through our history and your knowledge of our history, we are very careful not to bucketize costs that are not one-time is one-time. In this case, the majority of those expenses, the vast majority were related to opening up a new facility that is already proving itself logistically to be tremendous help in us re-growing that business. In particular, as you know, micro businesses in the U.S. were dramatically disproportionately impacted, but we're already seeing the green shoots that I spoke about six, nine months ago that we would see. We're already seeing them from new start-ups. 37:28 The good news about having a lot of cash right now in society is that the entrepreneurial spirit in the U.S. is alive and well and we will definitely see new businesses starting up that benefit from our product sets and we've repositioned that business to be located in an area that is very advantageous to be much more successful even than we were in the past before the pandemic.

So, let me give you an example. In Australia, everything -- not everything, but we certainly import from Europe, the U.S., and Asia significantly larger amount of products than we do from other locations. Their logistics, their shipping costs, things like that are up incredibly. Even cross-country in Australia, the shipping costs are up large amounts. 39:03 Historically, as I've told you in the past, I believe last quarter, I can count on two percent is the shipping cost number throughout -- most of my history in international businesses and it is way up depending on the business above that. So, those are not going to go away. We definitely see those continuing to be impacted. Obviously, fuel rates things like that will change things, but we are anticipating that our cost remain up for an extensive period of time. 39:33 In addition, suppliers are having lots of different pressures from labor inflation to core material cost inflation that they are in some cases passing on more or less aggressively and we are certainly very aggressive about making sure we have a cost effective and significantly positive supply base, but we don't see that going away. 40:02 And so where we're pushing is on things like automation we're excelling. I think that you are aware we just introduced and literally are just almost fully completely functional on our inventory storage system in our major North American distribution center. This is both a way to rapidly increase our ability to be productive, but also to significantly reduce our costs. 40:34 We're able to get products out to our customers quicker and a higher quality rate because of this, but also less dependent on labor that is difficult to find and the costs are increasing.

We currently do have some of those key products on ships again, thank goodness, but what that means is, we were able to get ahead of the curve and produce enough extra that we could still keep shipping by air, but put a bunch on ships. So, that is absolutely true in that regard. We definitely moved the first and foremost. 44:50 Now, did we ship everything we wanted to ship? No, we didn't. But I will tell you, I was personally amazed at the Herculean effort at some of our factories to close out October, Amazed. It was a tremendous effort and it made me literally just proud of all our people of how hard they work, how driven they were. 45:15 We've got a very motivated team and they have a lot of pride. They have a lot of pride in getting to our customers what they need and they don't want to let them down. And so, although we did leave some material on the shelf and some material in the system, we really closed the gap in a very significant way.\\nKeith Housum: 45:37 Okay. And then the final question from me, you referenced price increases going into effect. Can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the end markets which just price increases you will be going toward and you guys raise your prices on a regular cycle, so just want to confirm is this off-cycle in IDS, WPS, and Crafts, any color on the amount that you're being forced to raise prices?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Michael Nauman: 46:01 Well, first of all, I don't say across the board because we don't peanut butter spread, but the truth is, there is some level of price increase across the board. It just isn't -- we're not putting in place X, Y, Z percent across the board and the timing does vary, Keith. We have contracts, we have agreements, we need to interact with our customers. We treat our customers with a lot of respect. We care about them tremendously. But at the same time, to your point, we have to pass on the value that we create in price increases to them as we're dealing with those pressures. 46:37 Timing, we do have off-cycle increases, we do have on-cycle increases. We are overall raising our prices more than we have in the historical past as our most industrial companies right now. So, overall, I'd say this, yes, off-cycle increases, yes, on-cycle increases and larger increases. But it does absolutely vary by product set and the cost pressures that we're facing in the cost -- product set. 47:06 You also mentioned regions, that's also true on regions. We're raising prices effectively in all regions, but those price increase timing and amounts do vary by region, by customer, by product set. So, yes, this is a significant effort for Brady right now. As I guarantee and I talked to a lot of people, it is for almost all organizations.\\nKeith Housum: 47:34 Yeah. All right. Thanks, Michael. Good luck.\\nMichael Nauman: 47:37 Thank you, sir. Have a great one. Thanks, Keith.\\nOperator: 47:40 Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nMichael McGinn: 47:45 Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering, if you had a sense of how lean you think the distribution channel is, how much room there still is to restock and what kind of percentage of your total business that represents?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Michael Nauman: 48:00 Well, I apologize, I may not have heard the question perfectly. I'm not sure that was on the slide. But I think what you're asking me, I will say this, we are not seeing significant stock-ups by the distribution channel and that's good news, in that, I do eventually expect an economic boomerang from stocking up, but we are definitely not seeing it right now with our partners, our distributor partners. 48:29 Little harder to tell with our end users, but if you look at society overall and what's happening and I think we probably are seeing some of that. But it's a little harder to tell. But better that I know that it isn't definitely happening right now with our distributor partners. And so therefore, I’m optimistic that volumes will continue to go up in the near future. 48:54 What happens at the end as things untangle from this is yet to be seen. But I would expect, not for us, but for a general economic pullback as there is more inventory and you know this from all the numbers in the system overall than there historically has been.\\nMichael McGinn: 49:18 Great. Then switching gears to the geopolitical front, trade talks have seemingly resumed and we now have an infrastructure framework. Any overall commentary on where you see yourself benefiting in infrastructure and then on the trade, any kind of benchmarks you that the percentage of total imports of your business is?\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Michael Nauman: 49:45 Well, I'd tell you this, first about we love anything related to infrastructure. We believe we provide products that are critical for the world infrastructure, not just the U.S., but in your particular case, the question. The U.S. is so yes, we do definitely see some very positive construction. We do very well in the construction industry, as a result of the safety needs, identification needs of that industry, their need for high quality, high durability. So, we are excited about that. Obviously, that's going to take some time and the whole construction industry is still tangled up right now. 50:25 So you know, if you're – I’ve been analogy, which is probably myth, but Napoleon lost the war for a lack of a nail, in horseshoe in our horse on a cannon in the Battle of Waterloo. So, that is what I believe the construction industry is facing right now. If you go through a lot of areas in that way buildings are being finished because of literally one or two critical elements. And so, I do think that's going to take a little while to untangle that will impact the rolling out of the infrastructure money, as far as getting to us. But you know what the great news, because we're towards the end of that cycle, typically, the great news is, it will come typically. The great news is it will come. And when it does come that will definitely help Brady. 51:14 Now, let's talk about trade barriers and all of that, we -- it's interesting, everything from automation to developing new products for the next generation to forward to in-sourcing, to forward deploying our products. We've been working on for about five years now, ahead of a lot of companies are just now realizing that's the direction the world is going. By the way, because of the pandemic, so I'm not going to say, I foretold the pandemic, we absolutely did not. No idea. But we were believe -- we believe we were intelligently moving in the direction of the world would have to eventually go.

       " Document(page_content=\"we were intelligently moving in the direction of the world would have to eventually go. It just happened to be fortuitous. And I don't want to take advantage of a bad situation, but the reality is that we have been positioned proactively for that. 52:02 Why am I saying that because we have forward deployed a lot of resources as close to our customers as possible, as in company – country’s possible. So let me give you an example that's not directly related to trade barriers in the very recent, but the Brexit issue, we have plants and some capabilities all throughout the UK that are really going to and already benefiting from the need to in-source into the UK more products. And that can be said for France and Germany, the Benelux areas, the U.S. China, India, I mean, again and again we are adding resources that we've had in the works in facilities and people to new countries and new regions. 52:48 So, I believe our footprint forward deploying as much as possible to be as reactive, positively reactive to our customers as possible is also going to benefit from this new barrier-oriented mentality. We did it for our customers. We did it for responsiveness. We did it to make sure we always have the products where we need win, but as a result, we fortuitously are going to benefit from this as well.\", metadata={'quarter': 1, 'symbol': 'BRC', 'year': 2022, 'key': '2022Q1BRC'}),\n",

I'm showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Michael Nauman for any closing results -- remarks.\\nMichael Nauman: 53:31 Thank you so much. I'd like to leave you with a few concluding comments this morning. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly entered a new phase. In this phase, we're seeing stress supply chains, increased input costs, labor shortages and overall increased inflation. We're working through this effectively, but we are experiencing some short-term margin compression. 53:56 I don't know what the future holds for the global economy, but I do know that Brady is well positioned to thrive regardless of which direction the economy heads. We have a strong balance sheet. We're prioritizing investments for growth and we have a never-ending focus on cash generation. 54:14 As a result, we're seeing strong sales growth at once our pricing and efficiency initiatives catch up to the cost inflation, our strong sales growth and improved gross profit margins will drive significant bottom-line growth. 54:31 On a final note, I would like to wish a very special Happy Birthday to our own Ann Thornton here at Brady. It is her birthday today. I'm not allowed to say which one, but happy birthday and from all of your friends at Brady, please stay safe. Thank you for your time this morning. Have a great day.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Following an incredibly strong start to fiscal twenty two, we delivered an outstanding second quarter performance as our top line accelerated even further ahead of pre pandemic levels and we produced record Q2 EPS that well exceeded our expectations. With much stronger revenue highlighted by robust full price selling and good expense management, our second quarter profit for our footwear businesses also set a new record. 02:23 The levels at which our business performed during the first half of the year following a challenging fiscal twenty one reflects the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, close connections with our customers and the compelling execution of our footwear focused strategy to transform our business and deliver these results. 02:44 We are a stronger company coming out of the pandemic. Our results highlight the work we've done to accelerate online sales and enhance our store and omnichannel offerings as we create and curate leading footwear brands to be the destination for our consumers favorite fashion footwear. 03:04 Our teams continue to do a superb job providing the right product our customers are looking for combined with exceptional service and differentiated shopping experiences. Our outperformance was driven by better than anticipated results across the board with all businesses exceeding pre pandemic profit levels. 03:26 As excited as we are with the progress we are making, we are even more excited about our strategy and our future opportunity to build upon this foundation and drive growth, profit, and shareholder value. 03:41 I'll begin by providing some highlights from the quarter. Both revenue and adjusted operating income exceeded pre pandemic levels, increasing fourteen percent and three forty six percent respectively over fiscal year twenty, two years ago and higher operating profit delivered a record Q2 EPS of one point zero five dollars compared with a loss of one point two three dollars last year and positive zero point one five dollars two years ago all on an adjusted basis. 04:15 Additional highlights include delivering another strong quarter of digital results with double digit operating profit to achieve a nineteen percent digital penetration. This was driven by a ninety seven percent increase in digital revenue compared to fiscal year twenty as we retained almost eighty percent of last year's volume which was elevated due to store closures. 04:40 Next, driving much higher conversion and transaction size to deliver store sales that were almost at pre pandemic levels, increasing gross margin by six forty basis points versus last year and fifty basis points compared to fiscal twenty driven primarily by higher full price selling. 04:59 Leveraging adjusted SG&A by two thirty basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels and further strengthening of our already strong balance sheet and cash position enabling a balanced approach of investing in our business while also returning capital to shareholders going forward. As the vaccine rollout continued and economies on both side of the Atlantic more broadly reopened, consumers aided by government stimulus, stepped up their footwear purchasing in the quarter and chose to shop with our brands to satisfy their pent up demand. 05:35 We were pleased that every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations. Digital has been a key strategic initiative and the investments we've made have allowed us to double our e-commerce business in two years. However, we've also talked about how much our customers enjoy our store experience and the important role of our stores as a strategic asset in a compelling omnichannel offering, which proved out once again this quarter. 06:05 So, turning now to discuss each business in more detail beginning with Journeys. The Journeys team once again did a tremendous job capitalizing on current market momentum and achieved record revenue and operating profit in the second quarter marking the third consecutive quarter with record profitability. 06:26 Journeys performance as we emerge from the pandemic, highlights the competitive advantage the business has built and how we are leveraging those advantages to further separate ourselves from the rest of the industry as the destination for fashion footwear for teens. 06:42 Leading into decades of experience, and its unparalleled vendor partnership, Journeys definitely navigated global supply chain disruptions to secure supply of the brands and styles most coveted by its customers. 06:57 The current fashion cycle, which has been shifting more to casual product placed into Journeys wheelhouse with strength in the assortment across the board, highlighted by the balance in its top ten brands evenly split in the quarter between casual and fashion athletic. 07:15 On trend merchandise assortments and effective consumer engagement through social and other channels fuel strong demand and full price selling with particular strength in women's and kids. Both store and e-com revenue were up compared to pre-pandemic levels with digital leading the way even with much higher conversion rates and transaction size, driving store volumes. 07:40 Over in the UK Schuh delivered a solid top line increase compared to the second quarter two years ago, as government mandated lockdowns were listed and the retail sector experienced its first quarter of mostly uninterrupted operations for the first time since before Christmas. 07:59 Schuh business rebounded steadily, driven by pent demand and our successful efforts to drive sales of multiple pairs. And even as consumers increasingly return to physical shopping, Schuh retained much of the online gains from a year ago, resulting in online contributing almost forty five percent of total sales. 08:22 The UK retail market is going through a highly disruptive phase with strong consumer propensity to shop online and with many retail bankruptcies reshaping the landscape. The Schuh team is taking advantage of this disruption, utilizing its advanced digital offering to strengthen consumer connections during the lockdowns. And those efforts are paying off as the market reopens and shoppers once again have the choice to engage with the brand either online or in-store. 08:54 Many of the product and brand trends driving Schuh’s performance as usual are the same as Journeys, but with a slightly heavier tilt towards fashion athletic. Another highlight of the second quarter was the more rapid than expected pace of Johnston & Murphy’s recovery, boosted by an improving market environment and strong demand for many of the brand's newest product offerings. 09:19 With a number of social events and family gatherings increasing and more customers returning to in person shopping. Retail traffic improved each successive month during the second quarter, building upon the gains in the first quarter. 09:34 At the same time, e-commerce revenue grew strongly, increasing over fifty percent compared to pre-pandemic levels as customers chose the digital channel to engage with the brand. We were especially pleased with the performance of J&M’s new athletically inspired casual assortment. Sell-throughs were very strong with many new items selling out in both our direct to consumer channels, as well as in the wholesale channel where J&M gained significant market share. 10:05 These product launches accompanied by enhanced marketing campaigns are attracting a younger customer validating our efforts to re-imagine the storied J&M brand beyond its dress-shoe roots into a modern lifestyle brand with broad consumer reach. With second quarter sales nearing pre pandemic levels combined with strong full price selling, J&M’s operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels a remarkable turnaround compared to last year. 10:36 These trends are adding to our optimism for continued improvement whenever America begins the return to office phase hopefully later this year. Rounding up the highlights from the quarter, licensed brands revenue more than doubled versus a year ago, reflecting the growing contribution from the footwear license we acquired in January twenty twenty. 11:00 Operating profit improved versus pre pandemic levels, although not at the rate we expected due to higher freight costs, which are temporarily pressuring near term margins. We continue to be very pleased with how Levi's product is selling in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys to Journeys kids to family footwear. 11:22 This has led to a strong order book for the back half and reinforces our excitement about the potential to create value by combining Powerful brand licenses with our fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities. 11:38 Turning now to the current quarter, we have been pleased with our results to date as sales track ahead of pre pandemic levels in August, and we are several weeks into the all important back to school selling season. 11:53 Last year's back to school was like none before since most children began the school year learning remotely. This year, the vast majority of students are beginning the school year in person which is driving more robust sales. 12:07 While the Delta variant back to work timing and other factors will drive different patterns of consumption in the back half with a healthy and resilient consumer and the strength of our offering. We remain confident in our ability drive sales above fiscal twenty level for the remainder of the year. 12:27 We will work hard to continue to successfully implement strategies to overcome the inventory, supply chain, labor, cost pressure and other headwinds that are endemic in our industry today. Tom will give additional details on our outlook. 12:45 Shifting gears, our footwear focused strategy is working and is delivering results. This strategy implemented before the pandemic leverages our strong direct to consumer capabilities across footwear retail and brands and the synergies between platforms. 13:04 Driving this strategy are six strategic pillars that emphasize continued investments in digital and omnichannel, deepening our consumer insights, driving product innovation, reshaping our cost space and pursuing synergistic acquisitions all to transform our business and exceed the expectation of today's consumer whose needs have rapidly advanced. 13:30 In addition, COVID has provided us the real opportunity to transform our business at a faster rate. And we are on a very good pace to deliver growth and improved operating margins. While each of the six pillars is important to achieving our future objectives. I'd like to expand on just a few of our initiatives, which are driving results, while Tom will discuss reshaping the cost base. 13:58 Our strong digital growth highlights the progress we're making with this key strategic initiative. In Q2, we welcomed forty eight million visitors to our website and new e-commerce customers increased eighty percent from pre-pandemic levels. Data driven consumer insights, more robust CRM and enhanced marketing are key to increasing consumer engagement and driving our next big wave of growth. 14:27 Schuh is taking advantage of the market disruption brought on by the pandemic and to invest further in new customer prospecting through digital marketing designed to target competitors customers, as well as geo targeting where competitors physical locations have closed. These efforts have helped contribute to an increase new online customers of more than one hundred percent compared to pre pandemic levels. 14:54 Journeys marketing efforts are gaining leverage by focusing on influencers, who the team consumer views as more authentic, creating a more organic experience that further builds upon the trust Journeys has established with this customer. This content is being delivered through social media channels and SMS, helping to drive a significant increase of fifty plus percent of new online customers. 15:20 In addition, Journeys continues to make progress implementing an upgraded integrated customer database with enhanced CRM capabilities, which will improve customer retention and acquisition and provide a clearer view of customer lifetime value. 15:36 To keep up with this increase in digital demand Journeys is wrapping up testing and bringing online another bespoke e-commerce fulfillment module, which doubles capacity ahead of the ramp up of demand for online orders during holiday. 15:52 We are underway rolling out North America new point of sale hardware and software along with new tablets, advancing our efforts to digitize our stores and enhance the omnichannel channel shopping experience. 16:05 For consumers [tablets] (ph) facilitate easy access to the full assortment anywhere in our system and upgrade our client telling efforts. And mobile checkout allows consumers to skip the checkout line. For employees, this new technology creates efficiencies across a variety of in store tasks, such as new hire on-boarding and employee training and communication. 16:31 With J&M’s accelerating recovery; we can put greater focus on the next phase, re-imagining the brand. Product innovation and technology is at the center of differentiating J&M’s casual products and commanding more premium price points. 16:49 Launches of the athletically inspired Amhurst and Activate collections and the expansion of the J&M golf collection were highly successful this Spring and another major step moving the brand beyond its dress-shoe origins. 17:03 J&M's design team is focused on expanding its technology toolbox with innovation, including the [access chassis] (ph) system, which offers optimal support, comfort and flexibility; TrueForm, which delivers superior cushion and lightweight comfort; and Smart Degree, which is temperature regulation technology. 17:26 New product design and technology coupled with consumer insights and amplified marketing messaging will be the winning formula to grow J&M as a fresh lifestyle brand with broader consumer reach. 17:39 Turning to ESG, we continue to advance these efforts including the establishment of our Board's ESG sub-committee, and we are working toward publication of a comprehensive ESG report next year. Again, these are just a few of the initiatives that are driving positive transformation for Genesco. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress and on other initiatives. 18:05 Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to thank and congratulate all our people across our company for your excellent execution, hard work and great success in the first half of this year. 18:18 You continue to superbly navigate a dynamic and challenging environment with the health and safety of each other in mind and I continue to be amazed by your drive and determination. 18:30 Genesco’s future is so bright because of you all. 18:34 Finally, our thoughts are with our neighbors to the rest of us in Nashville affected by the devastating floods last week, and those impacted this week by Hurricane Ida. 18:44 Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\\nTom George: 18:46 Thanks, Mimi. As Mimi mentioned, total Q2 results far exceeded our expectations and last year across the board. For comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our fiscal twenty provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance and the return of our business to pre-pandemic levels. However, when comparing to fiscal twenty, I would like to remind everyone how our strategy has changed our business. E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales and our licensed brand segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales. 19:33 These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses. While these changes will reshape the P and L, they have a positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital intensive business model. 20:00 Turning back to Q2 results, I'm pleased to report that not only did the second quarter continue, but it accelerated the sequential improvement of our operating results since the onset of the pandemic. Higher revenue and gross margin combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal twenty and Q2 adjusted earnings per share of one point zero five dollars compared to zero point one five dollars in fiscal twenty. 20:35 In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was five fifty five million, up fourteen percent compared to fiscal twenty, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, which is up ninety seven percent versus fiscal twenty, taking overall digital sales to nineteen percent of our retail business compared to ten percent in fiscal twenty twenty. 21:04 Digital growth combined with much higher wholesale revenue drove strong sales improvements for Journeys shoe and license brands compared to pre-pandemic levels, while J&M made significant strides narrowing its revenue gap. We did not provide overall or store comp results for Q2 as our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for seven consecutive days either this year or last year, and therefore, we feel that overall sales is a more meaningful metric. 21:40 With stores open for ninety seven percent of the possible days in the quarter, overall store revenue was down only one percent versus fiscal twenty. Consolidated gross margin was forty nine point one percent up fifty basis points from fiscal twenty, driven by full price selling, partially offset by the mix shift towards license brands and higher shipping costs from higher penetration of e-commerce. 22:12 While e-commerce puts pressure on our gross margin rate, as I mentioned, it comes with a lower cost structure and double digit operating income. Journeys gross margin increased two twenty basis points, driven by lower markdowns in both stores and online. Schuh’s gross margin decreased two hundred basis points due entirely to the higher shipping expense from the shift in e-commerce channel mix. 22:44 J&M’s gross margin increased five seventy basis points benefiting from fewer markdowns taken on pack-and-hold inventory and higher full price selling. 22:56 Finally, the revenue growth of license brands, typically our lowest gross margin rate negatively impacted the overall mix by ninety basis points. Adjusted SG&A expense was forty five point three percent, a two thirty basis point improvement compared to fiscal twenty twenty as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions around expense management. 23:25 The largest year over year savings came from occupancy cost, driven by the UK Government program, which provides property tax relief, rent concession across our businesses and ongoing rent savings on renewals. 23:42 The next largest areas of savings came from the reduction in store salaries, thanks to the effective use of workforce management tools to drive higher conversion in the face of significant wage pressure. These savings were partially offset by higher incentive compensation, driven by improved profitability and increased marketing expenses needed to drive traffic in both stores and online. 24:14 As the multi-year shift in consumer traffic continues towards online and away from brick and mortar, our organization has been intently focused on the critical effort to right-size occupancy cost to be in line with store traffic. The pandemic has exacerbated the transition to digital and we continue to have even greater traction on rent reductions. 24:40 Year to date through Q2 we have negotiated seventy five renewals and achieved a twenty nine percent reduction in rent expense in North America. This was on top of a twenty two percent reduction for one hundred and twenty three renewals last year. These renewals are for even shorter term average in approximately two years compared to the three year average we have seen in recent years. 25:09 With over forty percent of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this will remain a key priority for us going forward. 25:18 In summary, the second quarter's adjusted operating income was twenty one point one million versus fiscal 2020’s four point seven million. All operating divisions achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal led by Journeys nearly one hundred and seventy percent increase. Our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was twenty five percent. 25:45 Turning now to the balance sheet. Q2 total inventory was down twenty seven percent compared to fiscal twenty on sales that were up fourteen percent as we remain challenged, keeping pace with the consumer demand levels and with delivery delays. Our ending net cash position was two eighty four million, seventy million dollars higher than the first quarter's level driven by strong cash generation from operations. 26:14 As a reminder, we currently have ninety million dollars remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase plan, and we have a solid track record of returning cash to our shareholders. Capital expenditures were eight million dollars as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel and depreciation and amortization was eleven million. We closed eight stores and opened three during the second quarter. 26:45 We will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or full fiscal twenty twenty two. However, I would like to provide some color around our expectations using the pre-pandemic fiscal twenty as the reference point. As we transition into Q3, thus far, we have experienced a more normalized back to school selling season for Journeys and Schuh, but is expected the impact from stimulus has moderated and due to the spread of the Delta variant, there are more questions around when customers will begin returning to their offices, which will impact J&M’s trend and whether Delta will disrupt in-store shopping. Supply chain disruptions persist, pressuring both the top line and product cost. 27:38 Now getting to more specifics of Q3 starting with revenue. We expect higher revenue compared to fiscal twenty levels, given the strength of our assortment. This is mainly due to continued strength from the Levi's business and growth at Journeys and Schuh. J&M will likely remain under fiscal twenty’s level. 28:03 Directionally, the overall sales increase for Q3 compared to fiscal twenty twenty could be up mid-to-high single-digits. From a channel perspective, the highest growth will once again come from wholesale and direct. We expect gross margin rates for Q3 will be somewhat under fiscal twenty levels, due to substantial pressure from import freight increases at J&M and license brands from supply chain disruptions. 28:37 We expect the retail promotional environment to remain favorable, offsetting the ongoing pressure from higher e-commerce penetration and the higher shipping cost that come with it, as well as the impact of licensed brands growth, on our business model as previously discussed. 28:59 We expect that Q3 adjusted SG&A will be a little better as a percentage of sales than in fiscal twenty twenty. Sequentially, we will not see the large SG&A leverage we saw in Q2 as revenue growth will be lower and the benefits from some government relief programs will be less than Q2. 29:23 That being said, compared to fiscal twenty, higher revenue will boost leverage in both occupancy and selling salaries partially offset by higher marketing and performance based compensation as we anticipate higher bonus expense than fiscal twenty twenty. 29:40 In summary, we expect the operating income to be similar to fiscal year twenty levels and the margin rate to be somewhat lower than fiscal year twenty due to these factors, in particular, the increased import freight in our branded businesses. 29:58 For taxes, we expect the Q3 tax rate to be around the twenty five percent we saw in Q2. The annual tax rate is expected to be approximately thirty percent. In addition when comparing results, we had some expense pickups like rent abatements in the back half of fiscal twenty one, particularly in Q4. We don't expect to recur in the back half this year. 30:27 Next, I would like to provide a brief update on our cost savings initiative. Given the shift of our business from stores to digital, accelerated by the impact from the pandemic, we continue to make progress on reshaping our cost structure and allocating resources towards digital growth. 30:45 As a reminder, our target for the year is to identify savings and operating expenses of twenty five million to thirty million on an annualized basis or approximately three percent of total operating expenses. The entire organization is focused on this critical initiative, and I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress towards our target. 31:11 The teams have identified over twenty million dollars of savings with the largest amount coming from rent and the remainder in several areas, including increased selling salary productivity, travel conventions, inner store freight, marketing, compensation and other overheads. These savings benefit primarily the store channel and its profitability. 31:39 The cost savings initiative is a key pillar in our strategy to transform our business. Designed to reflect a more capital efficient model, focusing on driving further improvements in return on invested capital and allowing for improved flexibility in our operating model. Going forward, we see opportunities to be less dependent on store capital expenditures have lower lease obligations and continue to drive efficient use of inventory. 32:11 In conclusion, I would like to thank all our employees for such an incredible start to the fiscal year. These results emphasize that we have the right team and the right strategy to continue to drive shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.\\nOperator: 32:34 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Please proceed with your question.\\nMitch Kummetz: 33:11 Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Let me start with the guidance or the outlook for Q3. So, I think you said sales up mid-to-high single-digits on a two year basis. Can you say kind of where August came in relative to that? Is August better than that? You're expecting some moderation or can you maybe just provide a little color on that?\\nMimi Vaughn: 33:37 Sure. Let me – hi, Mitch, it’s Mimi. Let me start and then turn it over to Tom. I think that it's important to put August in the dimension of what happened last year with back to school and also this year. So things were a lot different a year ago. We estimated that two thirds of students attended school only virtually to start the year. 34:00 This year, we estimated that there was a real push to get kids back into school and we're estimating that essentially all students went back in person. And so, we had a great second quarter and coming into the quarter we thought that back to school also would be positive and we have continued to see, we've been pleased with the results so far, we've got the right assortment. We've been pleased with what we have seen. 34:28 One important note is that the Labor Day this year compared to fiscal year twenty and that's what we keep comparing to is, one week later. So, we're going to know basically this weekend, what the comparison period is. So, we're tracking to and above fiscal year twenty levels overall, and we'll know more when we complete the Labor Day weekend. We also think that there is a likelihood of back to school having a longer tail in September and October, like it did last year. 35:06 We didn't see a lot of sales in July and August last year, but people waited to see exactly what might happen in schools and there was more purchasing later on. And Tom I don’t know if you had anything to add to that?\\nTom George: 35:19 No, I think that's a good summary. We feel really good how we're tracking so far and keep in mind; we have more of a wholesale business this year as well relative to two years ago. So, that tracks really at a different pace than the retail business and we do expect some good growth out of our direct channel as well this year relative to two years ago. So, feel really good where we're tracking so far.\\nMimi Vaughn: 35:46 Yeah. And I'd also remind you mentioned that August is a really important month that's over forty percent of the third quarter because of how heavy back to school is. So, it's good to have that month behind us.\\nMitch Kummetz: 35:58 Okay. And then Tom on gross margin, you mentioned that you expect gross margin to be below twenty twenty levels for the quarter you just reported. I think you're up around fifty bps ahead of two years ago. So, is the difference all on freight or are there other factors that are putting a little bit more pressure on Q3 versus Q2 on a two year basis?\\nTom George: 36:23 The big difference there is freight. There's a significant amount of freight in the second quarter. I mean, we’re planning on approximately rounded numbers around seven million dollars of additional freight in the third quarter and that has a big impact on the gross margin percentage and a big impact on our operating income results relative to two years ago.\\nMitch Kummetz: 36:47 And just to be clear, is that seven million dollars more than two years ago or seven million more than what you saw in Q2, just help me understand with that?\\nTom George: 36:55 Relative to two years ago and it's a combination of additional vessel charges; it's a combination of airfreight things like that to get the product into our consumer’s hands. So, it's a big difference relative to two years ago. It's just a part of the results as some of the supply chain challenges out there, but we think we've got our hands around it to manage it and we think we've got our exposure included in the back half projection. And we also have some in the fourth quarter as well that have got in our projections just to be cautious.\\nMitch Kummetz: 37:30 Okay. Do you know off offhand what the other freight was in Q2 versus years ago? It was more minimal when we really started to see the backup of the supply chain. And particularly in our branded business, we are having to airfreight product and that's pretty meaningful. I think you’ve seen the container cost go up pretty significantly. So, it's really much more pressure in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter.\\nTom George: 38:02 And Mitch in the second quarter it was almost two million dollars.\\nMitch Kummetz : 38:05 Okay. And then lastly, just on the supply chain, how much longer you think these disruptions will occur? I mean, does this linger in through like the first half of next year? And can you speak to kind of your ability to get product maybe versus some of your competition? I know that for a lot of your brands, you're the largest or one of the larger customers and I'm just wondering, kind of how much of a competitive that advantage that is in the environment of a challenging supply chain?\\nMimi Vaughn: 38:38 Yes. So, we think it's a huge competitive advantage in this environment because is not a new problem. We've been managing through supply chain challenges really since the onset of the pandemic and we've been chasing inventory all the way through, basically last quarter what came in went right back out and yet sales were strong and sales has just continued to be strong. 39:05 So, in our retail business, we're seeing good products flow right now, but it's lower than we would like We have worked on mitigating the risk by ordering higher sales in our projection. So that would help us. And we – so that we can get caught up with some suppliers and we also ordered early and strong, certainly on some core retail style styles. We're an important partner to our brands. They've worked with us as much as possible. Journeys always get more than fair share of products. 39:38 So, we've got the window to re-inventory before holiday and think that it will certainly be challenge to holiday and from what we can see right now, even into the spring possibly, but there's a lot of time between here and there. Factories have been latest situation and there is time to address some of the situation there and then everybody is focused on clearing up some of the problems in the supply chain, but certainly through holiday and perhaps in the spring as well.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:08 Great. Thank you.\\nTom George: 40:11 I think maybe I’d add because we are such a strong strategic partner to our key suppliers, we took advantage of that and ordered early and higher on some key styles for fall.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:25 Perfect. All right. Thanks. Good luck.\\nMimi Vaughn: 40:28 Thank you.\\nOperator: 40:28 The next question is from the line of Steve Marotta with CL King. Please proceed with your questions.\\nSteve Marotta: 40:37 Good morning, Mimi and Tom, let me offer my congrats to on the second quarter. Can you please remind us the twenty five million dollars to thirty million dollars of cost savings? Can you talk about how that will be realized and what the cadence is there? And if there possible that there's anything behind that you've alluded to in prepared remarks, continued ways of making the business less capital intensive? Thanks.\\nTom George: 41:03 Yes, Steve. So, we're good progress. We've identified twenty that's on an annualized basis and we believe in the back half, we can realize half of that in the form of those items are outlined on the call. Occupancy expenses better selling salary productivity. We have fewer stores. We're going to have savings and depreciation. We've got some procurement initiatives. 41:27 So, roughly half of that twenty million dollars will be realized over the back half. And on the capital light model, I mean, we've got a good wholesale business now. And you can manage your inventories well, our situation we have with the Togast acquisition which is a very capital light model. 41:48 Fewer capital expenditures evolved obviously with the wholesale business because you're not opening up stores. Another driver of the capital light model is our digital business. It's a very variable cost model and we've made investments historically and we're leveraging off those investments going forward. 42:06 So, we feel really good how capital efficient the models come and we'll continue to look at cost savings as well as working on the capital base to continue to drive good returns on invested capital.\\nSteve Marotta: 42:21 That's helpful. And we're seeing across the space when cost savings like this are being implemented, a lot of that is being reinvested in digital marketing and demand creation investments. Is that your intent here as well? Or is it literally a net number coming right out of the P&L?\\nMimi Vaughn: 42:41 So, Steve, certainly, we are investing a lot in digital marketing and in demand creation and we have to do that for both our websites and to our stores. I think the key here is that our e-commerce channel is profitable. And the investments that we're making in digital marketing are actually generating a return. And so we think about that in terms of those channel economics. 43:10 When we think about the brick and mortar side, the challenges there really are to reduce occupancy expense and that's why we've been so focused on that. And if you think about, if we can align occupancy to the appropriate level of traffic right now, and we are spending a little bit more on advertising. So part of the way we're thinking about being able to fund that advertising is through the rent reduction. So, the way we're thinking about this is channel on a channel specific basis.\\nSteve Marotta: 43:46 Very helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator: 43:51 Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\\nJonathan Komp: 43:57 Yeah. Good morning. Thank you and hope everyone is staying safe. I want to just first to follow-up on the supply chain topic. I know, you don't have guidance into next year, but just given the situation with the factories are there scenarios you're hearing from your brands where there might be a shortage of product to sell even more than – more so than what you've faced so far? Just wanted to get your current assessment of the situation with the factory closures and the impact it might have?\\nMimi Vaughn: 44:29 Sure. Thanks for that question, John. I think that when you think about both Journeys and Schuh business, which represent probably eighty percent of our business. The key is that we are diversified across a number of suppliers. And I think that that gives us a real advantage and we've talked a little bit about how important we are to our suppliers, the great partnerships that we have had and the prioritization that we get as a result of how important we are to them. And so the key for us is just the diversification that all suppliers are working hard that they're in a number of different factories and in this case, having multiple brands is a benefit for us.\\nJonathan Komp: 45:16 Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe a bigger picture topic than on really the sustainability of the margin performance and coming off of a first half where you’re typically not very profitable and you were quite profitable this year. How should we think about really the ongoing ability to drive higher margin with everything you've talked about and the increased focus on footwear portfolio, but how are you thinking about what's sort of sustainable versus other benefits that maybe we should expect to continue and how that relates to your broader margin opportunity?\\nMimi Vaughn: 45:59 Sure. So, John, it's a great question. And I think we're so pleased with the results that we had in the first half, there's no question that there were unique factors in terms of the consumer being in a really great place to spend because of stimulus and other government help, there was pent up demand as well. But I think if you look at what specifically we are doing to drive the business. The first thing is around digital and we've talked about how digital is such a profitable part of our overall business. 46:31 We were able to double the size of the e-com business to the course of the pandemic, which means significantly more profit contribution and that'll be in every quarter of the year. We've also talked about rent expense and how important an initiative that is to improve the profitability on the brick and mortar side. And Tom said today, our improvements are just a little under thirty percent and that's compounding on a twenty plus percent last year compounding on eight percent to ten percent in prior years. 47:04 So through a compounding effect, that helps as well. And so we feel like there is a real path to be able with those couple of things plus the growth of the branded side of our business those license brands and this opportunity to re-imagine Johnston & Murphy. We saw the same thing coming out of the great recession. We had a chance to really take the brand up to the next level. And we think there is tremendous opportunity to do that through re-invention of the product, re-invention of the marketing, which is underway right now. 47:40 And so we saw a doubling of Johnston & Murphy’s brand really coming out of the great recession. We think there's an opportunity again to take Johnston & Murphy to the level. So, I think the combination of those three things give us great earnings potential going forward irrespective of the things that were unique to the first half of the year.\\nTom George: 48:03 And I think I’d add again with being a key asset to all the major relevant brands in the retail side of our business. We have the ability because another strength we have is our ability to merchandise product and service product and convert sales, we got the ability, I think everything else being equal to drive some really good gross margins going forward to continue to do that. And with Johnston & Murphy and our license brands business, we have the ability to drive good gross margins and some improvement in those going forward. 48:36 And then just a reminder in the wholesale business on the operating income level, we've got visibility in line of sight that the wholesale business as well is going to be double-digit operating margin going forward.\\nJonathan Komp: 48:50 Okay, great. Just last one for me. The incentive compensation piece, can you just, sorry if I missed this, but can you give us an update where you're tracking this year given the increase in the corporate expenses that we can see and then how should we think about kind of a normalized level after this year? Thank you.\\nMimi Vaughn: 49:12 So, thanks for that question. So, I think an important point to make is that we paid no incentive compensation last year. The way that our program works is that since the pandemic caused substantial disruption, to our operating results even though our team navigated the pandemic so well, constraining expenses and capital and improving liquidity that's because we didn't have year over year improvement, no performance compensation was paid. 49:44 This year, there is a substantial improvement in earnings on a lower capital base and our plan is designed to be highly aligned with shareholder interest as the bonus is generated for the incremental improvement. And so part of what you are seeing in the corporate expense is the booking of bonus, higher level of bonus this year versus two years ago. And we will see a little bit of that in the back half as well, but given the strong performance, that's how the bonus centers up being booked in the second quarter.\\nJonathan Komp: 50:20 Any willingness to quantify just so we can understand the moving pieces in the SG&A?\\nTom George: 50:28 No, we normally don't get into that level at detail, John. I think another point to be made though is, reinforce just a huge year over year improvement we had in economic value added because we did have big year over year improvement earnings on a much lower capital base that this year would be – the bonus related incentive compensation would be higher than we'd normally expect in future years.\\nOperator: 50:58 Thank you. At this time we’ve reached the end of the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mimi Vaughn for closing remarks.\\nMimi Vaughn: 51:05 Great. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of our third quarter.\\nOperator: 51:13 Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. 00:24 I would now like to introduce your host for today\\'s program, Bill Abler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nWilliam Abler: 00:32 Good morning and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from Entergy\\'s Chairman and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO will review results. In effort to accommodate everyone who ask questions, we request to each person ask no more than two question. 00:51 In today\\'s call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 01:08 Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in today\\'s press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 01:22 And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.\\nLeo Denault: 01:24 Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share, a very good start for the year. With favorable weather and higher-than-planned retail sales, we are ahead of schedule and solidly on track to achieve our 2022 objectives. And we remain on track for our longer-term outlooks. During the quarter, we continued to execute on both our near and long-term deliverables, just as we have over the last several years. We\\'ve made demonstrable progress on our operational, strategic and financial objectives. 02:03 Operationally, I\\'ll start with some notable regulatory updates. We\\'ve continued to make meaningful progress on storm cost recovery. Texas is done and Louisiana\\'s securitization proceeds from the 2020 storms, plus $1 billion towards IDA will be completed in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana\\'s filing for the balance of IDA will be completed within the coming days, and the Entergy New Orleans filing will follow later this year. A financially strong utility is important for customers. Drew will discuss how securitization progress supports our balance sheet strength. 02:44 As expected, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual formula rate plan which enables continued customer-centric investment and supports our financial outlooks. We\\'re continuing to drive progress on enhancing the resilience of our system, which benefits customers that supports local economic activity as well as our growth plan. Entergy Louisiana completed an important transmission upgrade in the southern part of the state. This $86 million project replaced approximately 80 structures to increase resilience along several miles of critical path transmission in La Pouch Paris, an area that was severely affected by Hurricane Ida last year. To create a solid foundation, the new infrastructure is placed in steel cases. 03:32 The line was built to withstand wind speeds of 150 miles per hour and will improve the resilience of the electric system. Entergy Louisiana also completed a $100 million project in North Louisiana, that positions the region for economic growth. The West Monroe project will provide additional transition capacity, improve reliability and is built to withstand extreme weather events. What that means for customers is enhanced reliability and resilience, better integration of clean generating resources and economic benefits to improved access to lower cost of power. Bottom line, the Entergy team continues to focus on delivering operational excellence across all facets of our business. 04:15 Strategically, I\\'ll start with our merchant business wind down. The last step in our merchant nuclear exit is nearly complete. Palisades is on track to shut down at the end of May with the sale to Holtec following around mid-year. The Palisades team is fishing strong, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated service. We have worked to help employees with their career goals beyond the plant shutdown. Many will continue to work for Entergy at other locations. Some will continue to work for Holtec on decommissioning and others are retiring. 04:50 As you know, DOE recently announced a program to save nuclear plants that are about to shut down. Michigan\\'s Governor issued a letter encouraging utilization of this program to keep Palisades open. We are supportive of federal initiatives to keep nuclear plants operating. However, we are five years into Palisades shutdown process. We\\'re far down the path. There are significant technical and commercial hurdles to changing course at this point. That said, alongside Holtec, we will work with any qualified party that wants to explore acquiring the plant and obtaining federal funding. 05:29 But I do want to be very clear, this does not change our strategy. Entergy is exiting the merchant nuclear business, even if Palisades continues to operate as a part of Entergy. Across all of our operating companies, we continue to be a critical partner to support strong economic development, bringing new businesses, new jobs and new tax base in the communities we serve. For example, Entergy Arkansas, along with the Wynne Economic Development Corporation announced completion of the select site certification for a 37-acre industrial site. Certification streamlines site selection process. Initiatives like this help track new businesses and new projects like the U.S. Steel expansion that was announced earlier this year. 06:17 Over the past five years, our economic development team has helped bring to provision close to 300 announced projects, $42 billion of capital investments, and more than 25,000 jobs. These outcomes have been critical to the economic health of our communities and have been a significant factor in the 9% cumulative industrial sales growth we\\'ve achieved over the past five years. And we continue to expect significant industrial expansion in the next several years. 06:50 As we have discussed, growth from our industrial customers has been driven in large part by cost, labor, logistics and regulatory advantages of the Gulf Coast as well as favorable commodity spreads, which continue to support expansion. Further, the current geopolitical state of the world makes the U.S. and the Gulf Coast in particular, a top choice for stability. 07:15 LNG exporters in the Gulf are being called on to expand production to help reduce Europe\\'s reliance on Russian energy influence. This opportunity represents a win for our customers, communities and owners, not to mention the community. To help support our customers\\' growth and decarbonization objectives are driving progress to expand our renewables footprint. As of today, we have approximately 650 megawatts of renewable capacity in service. 625 megawatts of solar projects approved by regulators and in progress, 725 megawatts of announced projects and up to 4,000 megawatts of RFPs. That\\'s more than half of the 11,000 megawatts of renewable resources in our supply plan through 2030. 08:05 We\\'ve made progress identifying new resources and active RFPs. Since our last call, Entergy Texas concluded evaluations of its 2021 solar RFP. Several resources were selected totaling at least 400 megawatts from owned and contracted proposals. We also made selections from the Louisiana and Arkansas 2021 RFPs earlier in the year. We will provide additional details about the resources selected from these proposals once parties reach definitive agreements. 08:39 We are also soliciting the next round of renewables. Entergy Arkansas recently issued its RFP seeking up to 500 megawatts of renewables to provide cost-effective clean energy, which furthers fuel diversity. Entergy Louisiana also issued notice to proceed with renewable RFP seeking up to 1,500 megawatts in Louisiana. Our customers\\' demand for decarbonization solutions, including green products is not slowing down. The long-term solar market continues to look favorable based on an improving technology curve and higher natural gas price scenarios. However, we fully recognize the near-term cost and schedule pressures that solar projects are facing. 09:25 Supply chain constraints have been exacerbated by the Department of Commerce investigation, which we expect will drive additional delays and the potential for further cost increases. These dynamics are affecting the entire U.S. solar industry, but we are continuing to work through these constraints and are executing on our solar expansion plans. It\\'s important to note that not all of our projects are affected. For example, Sunflower solar in Mississippi, our only owned project coming online this year as its panels on site installation is nearly complete. 10:01 Entergy\\'s owned solar represents a relatively small portion of our three-year $12 million capital plan. Roughly half of owned projects in the three-year horizon are not experiencing impacts of recent marketing constraints. A greater portion of our own projects are expected in the latter half of the decade, which would be past the current working insurance. As we\\'ve said before, we have a large backlog of customer-centric investments with the ability to rotate capital into our plan as an opening presents itself. The bottom line is that we recognize the near and medium-term constraints, still see strong market fundamentals in the long term supports our supply demand and customer objectives. 10:47 On our last call, we told you about the new U.S. Steel expansion. In support of this project and the customers\\' decarbonization goals, Entergy Arkansas filed for approval to acquire the 250 megawatt driver solar facility. Driver solar is an example of how we can partner with customers with their sustainability needs while accelerating the growth of our renewable portfolio in our regulated framework. It also highlights our unique growth strategy to help customers achieve the outcomes they desire, which in turn drives the outcomes for all Entergy’s stakeholders through more jobs and economic activity in our service area, increased capital deployment to support electrification, low growth to offset costs and higher rate of change towards societal decarbonization. 11:38 Nuclear also plays a critical role in our customer decarbonization strategy. Entergy is one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the nation due to our nuclear fleet. Customers are increasingly highlighting access to carbon renewable resources is key to economic development. They are looking to reduce their carbon footprint and many are indifferent to the type of carbon-free technology. We continue to see examples in the industry that reinforce the need to balance reliability, supportability, environmental sustainability. Entergy\\'s resource planning has always balanced these objectives. Our baseload nuclear plays an important role. 12:20 We have discussed the sizable long-term opportunity for Entergy to help our industrial customers decarbonize and achieve their sustainability unit levels. We had estimate an addressable market of approximately 30 terawatt hours by 2030. To put that into context, that\\'s about 25% of our 2021 total retail sales. That\\'s not to say that we capture the entire market, but we\\'re working how to serve our customers\\' needs and maximize this opportunity. With many carbon reduction goals coming past 2030, achieve greater opportunities beyond the next 10 years. 12:59 Realizing this growth requires significant investment benefits to all stakeholders. This will include meaningful transmission and distribution investments to reliably serve the expansion of our renewable beyond the [indiscernible] in our current 2030 resource. Financially, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Beyond the securitization progress that I mentioned, also significantly reduced our remaining growth equity needs through 2020. Currently, only 25% of the original amount discussed at our 2020 Analyst Day remains. We are on track to achieve steady predictable growth adjusted EPS in dividends, the opportunity to do even better. 13:44 We\\'re very excited about our upcoming Analyst Day on June 16. We\\'ll use that opportunity to provide a closer look into our multiyear strategy and financial plans. That includes our plans to quickly advance resilient investment in our coastal region to lower storm risk for our system, our communities and our customers. And to further expand our renewables portfolio to support our customers\\' decarbonization goals. 14:13 As I said, we\\'ve had a productive start to 2022, and we will continue to successfully achieve the milestones that keep us on track to deliver steady, predictable earnings and dividend growth while maximizing operating efficiencies and investments to make our system most resilient, reliable, clean and affordable it can be. These are the outcomes our customers want by delivering them to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 14:41 Before I conclude, I encourage you to see our recently released 2021 integrated report, \"The Future is on\". The report lays out how we delivered results in 2021, discusses why we\\'re optimistic and excited about Entergy\\'s future. You can see how we integrate the environmental, social and governance objectives to all we do. 15:04 I\\'ll now turn the call over to Drew to review our first quarter results as well as our financial strength and outlooks.\\nAndrew Marsh: 15:12 Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for the first quarter. As you can see on Slide 3, we had adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share. The drivers are straightforward and keep us solidly on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year. We remain confident in our continued success and we are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlook. 15:37 Turning to Slide 4, you\\'ll see the drivers for the quarter. As a result of our continued customer-centric investments, we saw higher levels of revenue as well as higher depreciation and interest expenses. Other O&M increases included higher customer service support and nuclear generation expenses. 15:56 Results for EWC are summarized on Slide 5. The drivers for that business are largely due to the shutdown sale of Indian Point last year. As Leo mentioned, we expect to complete our exit of the merchant nuclear business in the coming months. That will be a major strategic milestone. 16:19 Moving to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was higher than last year at $538 million. Higher utility revenue, lower fuel and purchase power payments and lower pension contributions were the largest drivers. As a reminder, fuel and purchase power payments were significantly impacted by winter storm Uri in 2021. Non-capital storm spending was higher than last year, which provided a partial offset. 16:48 Turning to credit and liquidity on Slide 7. We continue to make progress on securitizations that will strengthen our balance sheet to produce significant cost savings for our customers. Our regulators recognize that financially healthy utilities benefit our customers. To that end, Entergy Texas recently completed securitization for its 2020 storms. And on the day of our last call, the LPSC approved storm recovery and financing for the 2020 storm plus $1 million down payment on Hurricane Ida. 17:22 The approval included replenishment of Louisiana storm escrow to $290 million. Louisiana securitization is expected to be off balance sheet, and we anticipate a $3.2 billion issuance in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana plans to file for Ida cost recovery in the coming days, as Leo mentioned, we are targeting to receive proceeds by year-end. The timing of recovery ultimately depend on procedural schedule approved by the commission. 17:53 Entergy New Orleans is seeking approval on the New Orleans City Council to issue $150 million in securitized bonds to replenish the company\\'s storm reserve. If approved, this reserve would enhance credit and ability to respond to potential future storms. In addition, ENO plans to file for Ida cost recovery later this year. Our net liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, being further supported by the tax securitization proceeds received on April 1, and the $3.2 billion Louisiana securitization proceeds once they are received. 18:33 Beyond securitization and liquidity, we continue to focus on resilience, which we will discuss in detail at our Analyst Day. Part of that discussion will include how we are actively applying for federal funding to help pay for resilience investments and mitigate customer insights. 18:53 Looking at Slide 8. It\\'s been approximately two months since our last earnings call. And that time, we have reduced our equity needs by nearly $170 million through our ATM program, with roughly $570 million remaining to be executed between now and the end of 2024. Given the small amount, our plan is to close out the remaining days with the ATM program. 18:53 The four sectors shown on Slide 9 represent nearly half of our industrial sales. And the fundamentals for our industrial customers remained robust in support of continued growth expansion. In addition, expansion of LNG export facilities is coming into spotlight again. Majority of these potential LNG expansion projects will provide and expand Entergy service territories. 19:43 Looking forward to Slide 10, we have a solid base plan with good visibility to achieve our guidance and outlook. We are also monitoring situations surrounding inflation and interest rates. We did not see a meaningful impact on our operational results, and we remain on track to achieve our annual cost estimate. As a result, we are affirming our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range as well as our longer-term outlook. 20:13 As we move towards Analyst Day in New York, in June, we\\'re executing on our operational, strategic and financial objectives and building on a solid foundation. In New York, we\\'ll share our longer-term views on customer-centric investments and financial outlooks. And we look forward to seeing you there. And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.\\nOperator: 20:37 [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your question please.\\nShar Pourreza: 20:58 Hey, guys.\\nLeo Denault: 21:00 Good morning\\nShar Pourreza: 21:02 Leo, from your prepared remarks, just quickly on Palisades, should we assume you don\\'t want to even remain a short-term owner until the asset is potentially sold? So viability of the asset is really a Holtec question or could there be changes to the Holtec agreement? And maybe just elaborate a little bit on some of the technical challenges like refueling and the capital that\\'s needed to halt decommissioning and can they even be overcome?\\nLeo Denault: 21:32 Yeah. I\\'m nearly not going to, Shar, get into any kind of details about what would or wouldn\\'t work. The technical details, though, around operations, the plant will have to stop operating in May because we\\'ll be out of fuel. We haven\\'t ordered fuel. There\\'s a lot of work that would need to be done at the plants to prepare it to continue to operate beyond that cycle. And we really haven\\'t done the investigation into what that work would be because as you might guess, we have been planning for five years to shut the plant down. We do have an agreement with Holtec and obviously, that has certain features in it that by and large, have all been -- all the conditions have been met, except for the plant is still operating. So it\\'s just a real heavy lift at the last hour. 22:27 And as I said, we couldn\\'t be more supportive of the fact that continuing operation of the country\\'s nuclear fleet is important, the reliability of the bulk electric system and to the ability for us to decarbonize the economy, shutting those plants down is just moving backwards. But -- so I\\'m encouraged by those -- what DOE has got going on for future plants just at this stage with Palisades. It\\'s just a really heavy lift is all we\\'re saying at this moment.\\nShar Pourreza: 23:04 Got it. And then just on credit metrics and equity would you guys potentially trending above your thresholds. Do you see any opportunities to maybe further downsize your $570 million of remaining needs? And as you\\'re kind of getting closer to hitting your credit metrics and prepare to roll forward your capital plan, do you anticipate any improvements in credit metric thresholds especially as the business mix has improved and storm funding is moving closer to resolution? So would like, for instance, an improvement in thresholds, let\\'s say, the 12% to 13% effectively leave you over equitized versus the current projections?\\nAndrew Marsh: 23:45 Yeah, Shar, this is Drew. So in terms of opportunities out there that could continue to change or improve around our credit metrics, obviously. The one that we cited, I think, last -- at the end of last year, I guess, on the last call, was around pension. And certainly, interest rates are changing that pension liability. The returns associated with the trust supporting the pension aren\\'t as good as we were anticipating either all that kind of balancing out. That is something that we are watching closely, if rates continue to stay high and returns turn come back around to -- closer to our expectations, then it could create some more headroom in our credit metric. That\\'s probably the one that we are looking at most closely right now, so we\\'re monitoring that. 24:44 In terms of, obviously, we need to get the securitizations done. We need those to be off sheet as we\\'ve discussed. Those things are going to be big milestones in terms of taking some debt off of our balance sheet. And -- but we\\'re watching that closely as well. Outside of that, our expectations around capital, which obviously also drives our equity needs. Those are things that we\\'re watching closely. We do have some capital associated with solar in the near term. And we can -- I\\'m sure there\\'s going to be a question on the call about that. We can talk about that here in a minute. But we have other capital projects that are waiting in the wings, particularly around resilience. So if there is extra headroom for us because of delays in solar, there\\'s quite a bit of resilience investments that our customers are waiting on and expect us to achieve if there\\'s an opportunity. So I don\\'t anticipate any extra room from the capital side going forward.\\nShar Pourreza: 25:51 Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, if I may, and I appreciate that. It\\'s just on your Analyst Day. I know -- I mean, obviously, you guys talked about resiliency and sort of the green tariffs. Just given the timing of sort of the regulatory initiatives and the technical conferences, I know you obviously highlighted how they would fit in with the Analyst Day. But should we specifically think about the Analyst Day as a roll forward of your base plan and you\\'ll qualitatively maybe discuss these opportunities with some scenario, back testing analysis? Or could we actually see some of the spending actually rolled into the capital plan? Thanks.\\nLeo Denault: 26:28 Well, I think, Shar, we\\'re going to let the punch lines of Analyst Day show up on Analyst Day.\\nShar Pourreza: 26:41 All right. Thanks, Leo. [indiscernible] I get that past.\\nLeo Denault: 26:46 Got it. Thanks.\\nOperator: 26:48 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\\nNicholas Campanella: 26:57 Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks you for taking the question.\\nLeo Denault: 27:01 Good morning.\\nNicholas Campanella: 27:02 So I just wanted to hit solar supply chain risks quick and just the impact. Could you just help us just size the amount of megawatts going into rate base that would potentially be at risk? I think you said roughly half you\\'re secured on over the three-year horizon. So is that like 300 to 400 megawatts? And just to confirm, I heard your last comments right, to the extent that capital shifts, you were just going to backfill that with potential distribution resiliency spend?\\nRoderick West: 27:31 Yeah. And this is Rod. Good morning. From Leo\\'s comments, the near-term risk that we were referring to in terms of existing owned projects was roughly 280 megawatts because we we’re discrete about both -- we\\'re explicit about both West Memphis and Walnut Bend. And so from a megawatt standpoint, they really don\\'t represent a material amount of capacity. So we want to make sure that we put that in some context. And recall, Leo also mentioned the lion\\'s share of our renewable capacity actually shows up on the back end of the decade. So we\\'re calling it out because we recognize that there are some near-term constraints, but they really don\\'t influence, how we\\'re thinking about our build-out.\\nLeo Denault: 28:28 And I think to your last point, Nick, I think Drew mentioned it and I mentioned in the script, we\\'ve got a capital plan and timing that\\'s laid out. We\\'ve got other things waiting in the wings that we could or couldn\\'t accelerate. So the ability to roll something else into the plan that provides benefits to our customers in a different way is always there.\\nNicholas Campanella: 28:56 Absolutely. And then just Drew\\'s comments on inflation. If anywhere, where would you kind of call out that you\\'re kind of seeing the most pressure to the plan? And can you just kind of talk about just the current state of power markets, how you\\'re kind of managing customer bill impacts and the ability to just continue to extend your rate base growth here, perhaps any levers that makes your jurisdiction more unique than others, that would be helpful. Thanks.\\nAndrew Marsh: 29:23 Thanks, Nick. This is Drew. So the way you phrase it was an interesting way to think about it, in terms of putting pressure on the plan. I would actually turn that around and say that it actually enhances the economics of the plan because we think about where the inflation -- what the inflation does to our two central investment themes beyond sort of our base capital in renewables. And in resilience, we think that inflation will actually strengthen the economic case from a customer\\'s perspective to get those things done. Certainly, when you talk about renewables and higher gas prices, there\\'s more economic headroom there right now. And that\\'s accelerating the pressure to get the renewables done. We\\'ve already done a lot of work around improving our gas efficiency with the CCGTs that we\\'ve built historically. And of course, the Orange County Advanced Power Station is out there as well, a high-efficiency unit. So those things are helpful already, but we think it will accelerate our plan around renewables. 30:36 And then, of course, around resilience, a key piece of the plan is the costs associated with putting up hardened lines, distribution lines, transmission lines prior to a storm compared to the cost associated with doing it after the storm. And to the extent that there is inflation, that\\'s going to exacerbate that difference, which is already substantial, and accelerate the need for customers to do it ahead of time in a planful way. And so obviously, those things have an impact on the customer bill, but the alternative of not doing it is an even greater impact on the customer bill. So I think it will drive customers who want to accelerate our plan, which will include renewables and resilience investment.\\nNicholas Campanella: 31:30 That was very detailed. Thanks for the repose. See you in New York.\\nAndrew Marsh: 31:36 All right. Thanks, Nick.\\nOperator: 31:37 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your question please.\\nJeremy Tonet: 31:46 Hi. Good morning.\\nLeo Denault: 31:47 Good morning, Jeremy.\\nJeremy Tonet: 31:49 All right. Just want to come back to DOC a little bit more, if I could. And for 2023 projects, if you could just break down price risk versus timing risk. And do you see C&I demand kind of insulating the project to a degree on both these factors?\\nRoderick West: 32:10 Price risk -- ask the question again, so I want to make sure Drew and I are trying to figure out who\\'s going to answer what part of the question because I know that was a price risk question in there as well.\\nJeremy Tonet: 32:21 Yeah. Just price and timing for 2023 projects.\\nRoderick West: 32:28 So the -- on the projects that we just referenced that being Sunflower, for instance. Sunflower is not at risk. That\\'s one of our own projects. We\\'re expecting that one, as Leo alluded to, to be in service sometime in August. So we\\'re looking good there. The other ongoing projects that we are expecting a bit of delay of the ones I referenced earlier, West Memphis and Walnut Bend. We\\'re working with our BOT partners, both of whom are reputable firms, to lock down both price and schedule certainty. And so there is some risk on both because of the delays for both the supply chain as well as the DOC issues. But beyond that, we\\'ll see if Drew adds anything to that.\\nAndrew Marsh: 33:23 Well, I think the only thing I\\'ll add to what Rod said is that -- and actually, Rod mentioned earlier, the bulk of our expectations are beyond kind of the next two year window. And we\\'ve issued RFPs, the DOC piece accepted. And they\\'re fully aware of all the supply chain concerns and risks. And they are -- prior to the DOC action, they were already aware of tariff activity in that space. So we expect that these folks that we have -- that we are working with coming out of the RFP will be well situated to manage through the current environment and meet the expectations that they put through in the RFPs. 34:13 We expect that the DOC fees will be resolved at some point relatively near term. I mean, I think most of the folks that we\\'ve been engaging with would talk about by the end of the year. But even if it goes a little bit longer, we don\\'t think that, that puts our overall expectations in jeopardy. And certainly, in the near term, as I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of other things. If projects are delayed, there are plenty other things for us to accelerate forward and meet other customer expectations.\\nJeremy Tonet: 34:44 Got it. Thank you for thought. That\\'s helpful. And just kind of pivoting a bit here to nuclear and really small modular reactors, just want to know your thoughts on, I guess, how this could unfold going forward. And we saw one of your peers potentially partnering with the university to build an SMR. Is this something that Entergy would consider doing to demonstrate the viability of the technology? Or any thoughts like us on SMR when and if that could be something that Entergy is really moving more towards or exploring?\\nRoderick West: 35:19 Yeah, Jeremy. We\\'re certainly monitoring what\\'s going on in the SMR space. And as you might guess our nuclear folks are involved in advisory capacities and others with various entities to make sure that we\\'re -- we\\'ve got our finger on the pulse of where that goes. I think that the success of the technology is going to be critical to the decarbonization objectives of the economy. When you think about the ability to build cost competitive, carbon-free, smaller projects that aren\\'t -- the issue, for example, we have with the size of the capital budgets of the existing technologies is that they\\'re as big as the companies that fund them. And that\\'s problematic if you got issues in construction. So we\\'re very excited about that opportunity, when and how it fits itself into our needs, we\\'re continuing to monitor and it\\'s a little bit difficult to say. But certainly, I think we should all be -- room for that technology to take root. 36:31 We are spending, I know probably more of our efforts in the hydrogen space because of the unique position that we have in the hydrogen market with producers, consumers, stores, transported all in the heart of our service territory. So there\\'s a unique advantage there. But it doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not staying involved in what the SMR technology could do for us and for the economy in general.\\nJeremy Tonet: 36:59 Got it. It\\'s very helpful, I leave it there. Thanks.\\nRoderick West: 37:03 Thank you.\\nOperator: 37:05 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 37:13 Hey. Good morning, guys and Drew long time no see. Just -- other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up from my side. Just can you confirm that the storm Ida balance of costs, which you haven\\'t received sort of regulatory approval for? Does that still sit at $1.7 billion? I believe that was the number as of the end of the fourth quarter call. So if you could just confirm that or update us on where that sits now?\\nAndrew Marsh: 37:47 Yeah. So the answer is the total cost estimate for that storm is still at $2.7 billion in total, $1 billion of that is in the first securitization we expect to price in the next few weeks. And the balance would be towards the end of the year. The full $2.7 billion will be part of our filing that we are making in the next couple of days. We still be -- just to clarify, we have to get approval for the full amount to get cost recovery for the full amount. That hasn\\'t -- $1 billion down payment is not pre-approval of those costs. It\\'s just -- it\\'s a prefinancing.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:29 I see. So essentially, you\\'ll be seeking approval for the full $2.7 billion and the $1 billion that you\\'ve gotten already will be applied towards it. Is that the right way to think about it?\\nAndrew Marsh: 38:41 That is correct.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:43 Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the call today. Thanks guys.\\nAndrew Marsh: 38:49 Thank you.\\nOperator: 38:49 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your question please.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 38:57 Hi. Good morning, team and thanks for the opportunity here. Congratulations on continued results. If I can, just to focus on the first quarter and some of the dynamics here. Can you comment a little bit on the industrial demand and the 6.5% in the first quarter here? And how do you see this trend through the balance of the year as you think about it, especially given the potential for export-oriented industries to do particularly well here? And could you talk also in tandem at the same time about some of those trends that you observed specifically around accelerating customer desire for renewables? You had specifically identified at the start of this year, a number of very large customers. But I have to imagine, based on your comments already that there are actually several other larger customers that you\\'re talking to.\\nAndrew Marsh: 39:46 Yes. So this is Drew. I\\'ll take the first part, and I\\'ll turn the second part over to Rod. And so certainly, in terms of the sales expectations, we did have higher-than-anticipated industrial sales in the quarter. A lot of -- most of it was actually more or less in line. In fact, I would say, compared to our expectations, obviously, refiners, seeing very high crack spreads performed well. We did have some unplanned outages in some of the chemical and petrochemical space, which pulled us down a bit. And then there are unplanned outages for our Cogent customers, and that actually lifted us back up. So that Cogent piece was actually fairly strong, where there were a number of outages that helped lift is back up. 40:33 I would say that the other part, the unplanned outages for our regular customers, that was fairly significant too. So I mean, all in all, it\\'s probably about what we were expecting but a little bit higher. And as we sort of go through the balance of the year, and I showed you the statistics on one of the slides or some of our key industries, we do expect them to continue to run at high utilization rates. Aside from planned or unplanned outages, they\\'re going to try and trim those off as much as they can to run as hard as they can, given the current commodity environment. 41:10 And I will also say LNG wasn\\'t on that page, but LNG utilization rates are extremely high as well. So I\\'ll turn it over to Rod to talk about other...\\nRoderick West: 41:22 I was only going to elaborate on the LNG piece, and I\\'m not going to, Leo\\'s point, give any pouch lines around Analyst Day because we\\'ll give our point of view on our five-year outlook. But we are seeing greater interest in signing offtake contracts, which would support our view on expansion in the LNG space. We\\'ll leave it to our customers to lead that conversation, but we\\'ll note empirically that 85% of the projects are under FID consideration in the LNG space are in Entergy service territory. And so it just further supports our point of view that we have a unique growth story that is our customers have a unique growth story. And our ability to serve their expansions in addition to their -- helping them meet their ESG objectives remains a growth opportunity for us for us, and we still remain bullish about it.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:29 Excellent. And then just one other nuance here. I\\'m just seeing a lot of headlines here on insurance costs. I\\'m sure you guys have seen the headlines in Florida, but also in Louisiana itself, especially as it relates to catastrophic storms. Can you comment about any potential pressures from an inflationary perspective on your business specifics?\\nLeo Denault: 42:49 You\\'re talking about insurance specifically, Julien?\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:51 Yeah. I mean I was thinking about insurance specifically, obviously, a broader backdrop here, but insurance seems to be getting headlines here outside of the utility space of very late.\\nLeo Denault: 43:05 Okay. So I\\'ll -- now insurance is -- we aren\\'t allowed to ensure our poles and wires. So that hasn\\'t been a driver on that particular space. Just like everybody else, we have seen broad insurance premium pressure. And so we are working through that regardless of whether it\\'s property or general liability or what have you, et cetera. So we are cyber. We\\'re working through that and making sure that we continue to meet our overall O&M expectations on a go-forward basis. But that\\'s, as you said, it\\'s sort of symptomatic of a broader perspective around inflation. We certainly have seen inflation in the fuel space. We\\'ve talked about that a little bit. We are working with our stakeholders on how to manage that in the near term. I think long term, that is a commodity which cycles, and we expect the wildcatter spirit that\\'s out there and the oil patch to take over at some point and help bring prices back down again. 44:13 As far as sort of inflation in the capital space, we talked about that a little bit with solar, we\\'re seeing it in other materials and some of our other capital projects. But I think the thing to keep in mind on that is, we\\'re seeing it for our current marginal capital projects, but they\\'re being added to a much larger rate base, which is already invested in and fixed. And so it\\'s a much smaller piece of the overall rate base when you added in. And so the pressure from a customer bill perspective is not that great. Certainly, as I mentioned, the fuel piece is something we\\'re paying close attention to. And as far as just other operating costs, we haven\\'t seen much pressure as of late. But we\\'re certainly mindful of that, and we are driving our continuous improvement efforts to make sure that we stay ahead of that on an ongoing basis.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 45:11 Got it. It doesn\\'t sound like it\\'s an outsized impact to you all here. It sounds like you guys have it under control. And also it sounds like a pretty good update here at this Analyst Day. So we\\'re going to stay tuned. Thank you, guys.\\nLeo Denault: 45:23 Thanks, Julien.\\nOperator: 45:26 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\\nSteve Fleishman: 45:32 Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just on the resilience plans that you have talked about. I think going back to last year, you talked about kind of having discussions with key stakeholders and the like. And just -- can you give any sense of how those have gone? And is there any -- do you get a sense of urgency from people on this? Just any color there?\\nRoderick West: 46:03 Thanks, Steve. It\\'s Rod. Good morning. We have just completed the analytics around the risk scenarios, probably consequence of storms. And we\\'re in that evaluation phase of the CapEx investment scenarios. And so what you\\'re alluding to is the beginning of the formal and sometimes informal technical and stakeholder conferences and conversation. That actually begins in earnest tomorrow as we begin the conversation in New Orleans. And so the feedback loop is just beginning, and we\\'ll have more color around it at Analyst Day. I can tell you that we have certainly had informal conversations as we were beginning the analytics. And there\\'s a keen interest in understanding, one, what\\'s our point of view around the risk and the benefits of acceleration. Obviously, in the current economic environment, most of the stakeholders, customers and regulators and others alike are always going to be interested in how we think through the cost and bill impact. 47:29 And so we\\'re beginning, but I\\'m expecting a very active engagement from the stakeholders as we move through New Orleans. Certainly, Louisiana in route to what we believe to be our first formal filings in that July time frame for the City of New Orleans. And then the state of Louisiana certainly around that time frame, but not just likely later. Even in Texas, Steve, we have -- we\\'ve begun dropping ideas around how they ought to think about resiliency. They -- certainly, their point of view might be a little different in terms of the sense of urgency that you alluded to than say, Louisiana and New Orleans. But we certainly have their attention, especially given the role of our Texas service territory in the industrial growth space. And their interest in resiliency as well. But short answer is we\\'re just beginning, but more to say about it at Analyst Day, Steve.\\nSteve Fleishman: 48:38 Okay. So it sounds like at the very least, you\\'ll have better data scenarios for the Analyst Day of what different options are. And obviously, the results will be over time, depending on what customers states want. Okay. Thank you.\\nRoderick West: 48:57 Thank you.\\nOperator: 49:01 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your question please.\\nJonathan Arnold: 49:08 Good morning, guys. One question, just -- can you give us a little bit of a sense, you\\'ve alluded to being conscious of commodity and gas prices and obviously, take your points about the longer-term benefits of some of your investment plans. But what is the sort of current build trajectory that you see over the coming months? And maybe we could just sort of focus in on that.\\nAndrew Marsh: 49:41 Sure. This is Drew. So in the near term, of course, it depends on the jurisdiction. The one that you\\'re probably most interested in, of course, is Louisiana and the securitization costs associated with that. It will depend on what the final pricing is of those securitization bonds, but somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% once all those securitization costs are into bills. And I think that includes a little bit of uptick in the interest rates that we see. So obviously, our customers are expecting that. They know it\\'s out there. So we\\'re managing through that with our stakeholders. And the bulk of that has already been approved by the commission. And so it\\'s headed forward as we\\'ve discussed. 50:36 The gas price piece -- that reflects -- it depends on the jurisdiction, but it generally gets into bills fairly quickly in Louisiana, Texas, New Orleans. There is a little bit of hedging that goes on in Mississippi and Louisiana can help that, but it\\'s pretty small. But they\\'re used to the gas price volatility. Nevertheless, we\\'re continuing to work through it, the continuous improvement program that we have as part of that. We also have levelized billing programs for customers that allow them to manage through their bill and avoid some of that volatility. So those are examples of things that we\\'re doing to try to help customers go through that. And then over time, I think gas prices are a little bit above where our previous expectations were, but they\\'re still in a manageable range. And as we said and as you were alluding to, Jonathan, the investments that we intend to make should help with gas price risk and inflation risk on a longer-term basis.\\nJonathan Arnold: 51:51 When you say over time, Drew, you\\'re talking about sort of further out on the curve, right? Can you frame for us what the sort of 2022 impact on sort of top of the securitization might end up being on Louisiana customers, for example?\\nAndrew Marsh: 52:08 On 2022, yeah, it\\'s going to be a portion of what I was explaining earlier because it\\'s not always the overall securitization costs. So maybe about two-thirds of that. So about a 5% or 6% increase by the -- once those get into the bills this year -- later this year.\\nJonathan Arnold: 52:30 And then I think the commodity piece is incremental to that? Or is that included in that number? I guess my...\\nAndrew Marsh: 52:36 No. The commodity piece -- you\\'re talking about gas prices? Yes. I think a general rule of thumb around there is about $1 per MMBtu is about a 3% to 4% increase in gas prices, if that\\'s sustained over a year. Of course, we haven\\'t seen that yet, but that would be kind of the thought there.\\nJonathan Arnold: 53:00 Okay. Thank you for that color. If I could just on one other thing. When I look at your slide with the progress against guidance in the few buckets like utility O&M and the interest line and then also this is parent line that\\'s now there. It seems like you\\'re tracking -- you\\'ve had more than a quarter\\'s worth of the pressure you were expecting from the year in first quarter. I know that other taxes piece, you said would be kind of more front-end loaded. But is that timing across the board? Or are these some things that are building, but then you hope that kind of the sales uptick is going to hold your homeless effective? I was just curious if you can frame that a bit for us.\\nAndrew Marsh: 53:44 Yeah. Sure. So in terms of O&M, I think in the first quarter, you\\'re talking to the timing elements. We are on track for our expectations for the balance of the year. And in terms of the interest expense element, we are seeing some interest expense that\\'s a little bit higher than we would expect to stick as we go through the course of the year. But there\\'s also some timing elements in that sort of category that we are seeing in the first quarter that will turn back around. So you\\'re not seeing all of the interest expense in the first quarter and it goes away. It actually is going to be building over the balance of the year, but there are some timing elements in the first quarter that will turn around. But I think those are the two things that are going on.\\nJonathan Arnold: 54:30 Thank you for that. Thanks. Good luck. Look forward to [indiscernible].\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:32 All right. Thank you.\\nOperator: 54:34 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.\\nJames Thalacker: 54:43 Hi. Good morning, everyone.\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:44 Good morning, James.\\nJames Thalacker: 54:47 Just a real quick clarification just post Julien\\'s question. With a slightly better sales outlook you guys have, have the drivers related to mix changed materially, Ergo? Is this really being driven more by a more robust C&I sales? Or are you seeing higher demand across all classes despite an increasing trend for return to work at this point?\\nRoderick West: 55:11 This is Rod. I think the short answer is it\\'s been actually going the way that we expected. With residential demand trailing off as our residential customers are going back to work, school and kind of a pre-COVID life. And the growth story being driven by the C&I space that you alluded to. So from our vantage point, we\\'re actually tracking according to plan there with a little bit of robustness in the C&I space, but that\\'s about it.\\nJames Thalacker: 55:52 Okay. Great. And just following up on Jonathan\\'s question too, just to clarify, the 10% increase you\\'re talking about, that\\'s in -- that\\'s 10% increase across total retail sales, correct, in Louisiana?\\nRoderick West: 56:08 Yes.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:10 Is there somewhat of a skew across -- from a rate design basis like, is there a rough idea of like what that could mean for residential versus commercial versus industrial? Might be a little too granular at this point. I can follow up offline.\\nAndrew Marsh: 56:27 Yeah. I think Bill can cover that for you offline because I don\\'t -- I can\\'t actually answer that off the top of my head. There is a difference, of course. There\\'s a big chunk of distribution costs and that is going to go mostly to residential and commercial customers, not as much on industrial customers.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:45 Okay. Great. I’ll follow up with Bill. Thanks so much.\\nOperator: 56:50 Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your question please.\\nRoss Fowler: 56:57 Good morning. How are you? So if I think about your base capital plan at $12 billion. And I think if I remember correctly from -- we\\'re talking about $5 billion to $15 billion of potential incremental CapEx. I just wanted to understand or comment around federal funding. Is that $5 billion or $15 billion of incremental CapEx sort of net of that number or would any federal funding net that number down, whatever that number happens to be depending on the long-term opportunity set?\\nAndrew Marsh: 57:32 Yes. The federal funding would be outside of anything that we\\'ve got in our projections. So the $5 billion to $15 billion, that isn\\'t over the next three years, that goes out through 2030. Just to be clear on that. And it\\'s really an acceleration of work that we could do over time based on the fact that we might take things that are working today, but are old standard and pull them down and put up something of a new standard. It\\'s that kind of work that we\\'d be looking at. So any kind of federal funding would be used to offset the cost. And then that provides headroom that you could potentially accelerate more. 58:16 So one way to think about it, Ross, would be if you were going to spend $10 billion, and then all of a sudden, you got $1 billion worth of federal funding, we may spend $11 million, would be one option to be able to -- and you get it for effectively $11 billion worth of resilience for $10 billion number. So that\\'s the way we would think about it and likely propose it.\\nRoss Fowler: 58:40 Okay. That\\'s the way I understood it. I just want to make sure I was understanding that correctly. And then maybe longer-term, as you get to the credit metrics you need on the balance sheet you want on the balance sheet. If you think about your 5% to 7% EPS growth. As you execute some of these opportunities and maybe grow rate base faster than that in the long term, but there might be an equity need attached to the capital. So does that bring your EPS growth rate back down. What -- how do you think about rates on bills and your long-term growth rate? In other words, is the $5 billion to $15 billion thinking about extending that 5% to 7% or maybe even the upper end of that 5% to 7% for a longer period of time? Or is there actually an opportunity to accelerate that 5% to 7% longer term given bill pressure and other things that might happen with inflation?\\nLeo Denault: 59:33 Yeah. I guess I\\'ll kind of sum it up this way. We have a significant amount of growth opportunities because of the growth needs of our customers. The resilience spend is certainly one of those areas. The acceleration of renewables ahead of the schedule that we\\'re on to meet decarbonization goals of our current customers as they want to get outsized access to clean resources could accelerate renewables at the same loan growth. The expansion of our industrial base is a growth opportunity, just the growth that we\\'re seeing, as we\\'ve talked about, the utilization rates are high, inventories are low, all the commodity spreads are in the right place. That leaves itself pretty ripe for expansion. And that\\'s what we\\'re seeing as we have dialogue with our customers going forward. 60:31 And then the electrification side of things where they\\'re going to take existing load or existing processes that are not electrified and electrify them, and that creates load growth. So there\\'s all kinds of avenues for growth in customer demand for a higher level or a different level of service that could provide capital opportunities for us. I would say at a minimum, that just makes the runway pretty long for us in terms of where we are with the current outlook. Our objective would certainly be to have a better outlook going forward and balance all the things that you were talking about. The growth in sales, the growth in investment, and the growth in financing needs and balance all that out in a way that creates a different trajectory for us going forward. 61:18 And I think our customers are going to demand the types of investments we need to make that happen. But that\\'s in the future. So I think all of those combined certainly bode well for a continuation of the growth that we\\'ve seen and demonstrated over the course of the last several years, pretty much like clockwork. And then I think our objective and the work we need to do is to find a way to make it better.\\nRoss Fowler: 61:46 All right. That’s perfect. Thank you for that. Look forward to seeing you in June.\\nLeo Denault: 61:51 All right. Thank you, Ross. Look forward to seeing all of you as well.\\nOperator: 61:55 Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to hand the program back to Bill Abler for any further remarks.\\nWilliam Abler: 62:05 Thank you, Jonathan and thanks to everyone for participating this morning. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q is due to the SEC on May 5, and provides more details and disclosures about our financial statements. Events that occur prior to the date of our 10-Q filing that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet would be reflected in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, as a reminder, we maintain a web page as part of Entergy\\'s Investor Relations website called Regulatory and Other Information, which provides key updates of regulatory proceedings and important milestones on our strategic execution. While some of this information may be considered material information, you should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information. And this concludes our call. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: 62:55 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.',\n",

Throughout this recorded presentation, investors will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. The company may not be in a position to answer every question received during the meeting itself. However, the company will review all questions submitted today, I published responses where it's appropriate to do so. 0:27 Before we begin, I’d like to submit the following part and if you'd give that your kind attention, I'm sure the company will be most grateful. I now like to hand it over to Jaco Prinsloo CEO, good afternoon to you sir.\\nJaco Prinsloo: 0:40 Good afternoon. And thank you very much for the opportunity to engage with you, again and for first having to thank you for our interim results for the period. It's also a pleasure and I think the feedback we get for this platform is very valuable. So myself and Lewanne Carminati CFO will be taking you through the key aspects of our results in this presentation, and hopefully have some time for Q&A afterwards. 1:12 So let me just jump straight into the overview of the financial year or the year. I think, first of all, from a production perspective, we were 11% down on the ounces on the corresponding period. But I think it's important to note that, we still had a solid production performance and the factors that contributed to the level production are basically isolated to two incidents, so the first one being the temporary production suspension at Lesedi. We announced just after our financial year, last year, and then subsequent water shortages and then secondly, the lower PGM Feed grades of open costs raw material we receiving at the point of operation particular and that affects both the PGM Feed grades and recovery efficiencies. So those two explain basically the production deterioration and I will cover that a bit more in detail a bit more later. 2:12 Important want to notice that the PGM Feed Tons a 17% down on the corresponding period is primarily because of the Lesedi county just lost to all the other operations met or exceeded their production performance for the period. So as I said, overall, quite encouraging that they managed to mitigate a lot of the impact. From the financial perspective, obviously, as we've seen in the last financial year, we are quite heavily impacted by the movements in the PGM price. And in this instance, with a PGM also process deteriorated is 7% period and period. The combined to the lower PGM production, my fortune revenues and profits were quite a bit lower. Nevertheless, it was still a solid performance generating still good cash and profits. And that enabled us to be able to stall the clear windfall dividend for the period of 2.25p that we would aim to pay in April. That's following on from 4p and your dividends were paid in December and also 3.75p we've paid in April last year. 3:21 So last one on the slide, which we will cover in more detail later in the presentation is obviously the group cash cost being up quite a bit in the remaining area of focus. And because of our large, fixed costs portion of our costs and the answers being down, our cash costs are quite a bit higher, and remain the focus here. And we'll deal a bit more of it later in the presentation. 3:49 I think a lot of people are familiar with location of operations, this just gives us the brief overview for anybody who's new on the – on our company, that they are to pause our presentation, you'll see like in the project when we talk about projects and growth as well. We primarily have six Chrome, beneficiation and PGM plants – processing implants that are located on the Eastern Western Limb of this African bushveld complex respectively. And that's the those are the operations currently generating all our revenue and profits. 4:25 And then secondly, to the top of the picture there in the middle North is the to mining right areas that we have, or a number of mining right here is the one is the Grasevally Chrome Mining project that is within announced in recent announcements that is a sale that's in progress. And then the other two is the Northern Limb and Volspruit projects, which we'll deal with later in the presentation. 4:54 Looking at the production profiles, and I've mentioned earlier that, we fundamentally this year saw their production – and the lower production primarily because of the impact of the Lesedi and I'm wondering you can see the yellow and blue bars being smaller for 2022. We are ever looking at commissioning the Lesedi MF2 later and we will during the day towards the end of this quarter, to ramp up and stabilize during Q4. And we are looking at commissioning Tweefontein to later in this calendar year. So in the first half of the new financial year, and those 2 projects will help to ramp our profile up again, combined with us addressing the water issues and Lesedi, which I'll deal with in the next slide just now. I think also just worth noting on this little split is we show the these are 4E answers we're dealing with. And you saw our 4E Prill Split there on the side. But I have also just put a little table in on the slide that compares it to 6E. And you can see for instance for this period, the 32,400 ounces equates to about 41,860 ounces. And the only reason we doing that is for you to get an idea some of our peers and other companies in the industry announced only 6E ounces and then you can see what the ratio of the 2E is. 6:25 So if we look at more detail around the Lesedi problem and as I said with announced early last year, okay. After our financial again to the problems we've had, we've managed to successfully implement a number of mitigating measures that helped us to reinstate integrity of the dam to the current state where it's not a concern all the parameters are falling within our acceptable design and operating parameters. We have our ever from a production point of view incurred longer downtime than anticipated and the primary reason for that is when we started remining and recommissioning feed to the operation. At the end of September last year, we've had significant water shortages and also because we depositing on a temporary emergency tailings in the deposition facility, our return water rates, the recovery rates were lower than normal. And therefore it exacerbated the water problem and we had significant production downtimes at that operation. 7:30 However, we have subsequently installed an additional water supply through new boreholes that was installed at Lesedi and also we have just commenced commissioning of the new tailings facility at Lesedi. It's been in construction during the last year and you can see the bottom right picture there. It's a state of the art tailings facility with suitable storage return-water dam [Indiscernible] water-dam facilities that will be able to manage the water a lot more efficiently going forward. 8:03 So overall, we believe that we will see Lesedi coming back to more sustainable production and from Q4 obviously in this current quarter January and February still partially impacted taking into account in our forecast for the year. When we look at the other two areas of focus last at the moment, the lower on grades and as I explained in previous announcements since our host mine scaled down some of the underground operations in early 2020. We have seen quite a reduction in PGM Feed Grade to our main way operation in particular, with PGM Feed 30% to 40%, lower. And various sampling campaigns investigations has been performed during the period to try and address that to those months. Obviously, the current mine is don't do PGM grade control at all, the primary current mine is because it's not the business and we from Sylvania point of view and our relationship with those mines employ external geologists, the mining engineers, specifically the focus on the PGM grade occurrence on the various sources, so that we can work with those found to try and improve the blending ratio to our operation. And we anticipate an improvement in the feed grades to come. 9:26 The last one at the bottom of the slide is water constraints and operations and it ties into what I've just discussed on the Lesedi. But water generally in areas of the program, and we've also received on the piece of might have questions for investing meet quite a few questions relating to water. So I think it's worth maybe just looking at that what we're doing. They are various initiatives we have implemented since 2019 and that was really the first year where we had significant downtime between Mooinooi and Lesedi. We've had significant additional [Indiscernible] recover water around our own properties. We've also very innovative plan that employed a company called water enters to scavenge and reduce seepage water from around the perimeter of the tailings dams that added significantly to our water supply and helped us to balance the water better. And then finally, as I said, looking at better return-water facilities surround our designs in the new building facilities. We also continue to engage with our host minds with neighbouring minds with water specialist in the area to not only look on our own properties, but also conducting water studies, underground water surveys are now surrounds and there's a couple of projects that could potentially improve the long-term situation of water. So I think if it wasn't for the tailings dam issues at Lesedi, the impact would not have been so pronounced. But it is still a focus area for us in terms of long-term security. 11:01 From opportunity perspective, obviously we've – we quite happy that we are able to commission our Lesedi bond soon the MF2 which is the secondary milling and flotation MF2 as you would remember, this secondary billing and flotation. blonds is outflow from the very successful rollout of our Project ECHO or that we have rolled out MF2 plants to [Indiscernible] respectively, and which have been running very successfully for a number of years now. Lesedi is the next one to follow and then Tweefontein is also an execution to be done later in the year. And as I said earlier, those plants will contribute giving an experience. 11:47 Also is progress on the additional third party tenants material and that is specifically looking at higher grade available tailings for 3rd parties that we can blend into our existing infrastructure on the one end and also the new opportunities on the other end. Obviously, the existing ones we have is some smaller few sources to the tune of 2,000 ounces to 3,000 ounces a year we can add that's associated with some of our eastern operations. But then we also have various sampling campaigns where we continue to engage with the bodies to bring in secure more material online. 12:22 Fine chrome recovery is again, it's a project we've defined in terms of Unlocking Potential in otherwise sterilized resources with a PGM grade is too low in some of our old dumps. So instead of walking away from those dumps, because the PGM grade is low, there's lots of significant Chrome and there is a mutually beneficial business case for us and those mines to recover that Chrome and once you recover the significant amount of Fine Chrome you also upgrade the PGM to a stage where it is worth picking it another time for your operation. So therefore extending life of mine and we continue to focus on those projects. Lenox in particular is an example where this would work very well. 13:04 And then just finally, we manage to maintain a strong cash reserves and we continuously balance our existing capital projects to stay in business and interim expansion versus the need for future projects, looking at creating value for shareholders and the different instruments, and also then it gives us the advantage of having cash available in the event of opportunistic M&A. 13:34 So I'm gonna end over to Lewanne, just to take us through the financials and then we'll do a bit more some of the projects that the inbound the market and I'll do the details for us afterwards. So thank you very much.\\nLewanne Carminati: 13:49 Thanks, Jaco. Often, running brief through the financial information for the six months to 31 December 2021, net Revenue for the period was $69 million, and includes 4E revenue and by-products as well as base metals and the sales adjustment for the period. I'll go into the revenue a little more detail in the next slide. Cost of sales includes both direct and indirect costs of production, plus non-cash items, such as your depreciation, whichever has payments and we had provision movements. We've split out the Mineral Royalty Tax on the base of the statements given the increase in Royalty Attracting ounces, resulting in a much higher cost is typically disclosed. And then other expenses are [Indiscernible] G&A in South Africa, Mauritius, Bermuda and the UK and then a portion of that is also realized for its adjustments on revenue. 14:56 Lastly on this slide, is the income tax expense, which includes income tax that's payable on profits in South Africa at 28% deferred tax movements dividend withholding tax, which is declared on dividends declared by the South African operating entity upwards to the parent entity. And this brings us to a net profit of $24 million balance for the period. 15:26 Looking at revenue and net revenue is down 19% on the comparative prior period. The lower Basket price accounted for a decrease of $6.6 million and the lower ounce production a decrease of $9.3 million. The percentage revenue contribution for each of the six key metals is shown in the pie-chart in the bottom right of this slide. Platinum contributed 23% of revenue, which equates to about $15 million. Platinum 20%, Palladium 15%, which is about $10 million, and rhodium at 56% of our revenue at the $9 million. Ruthenium and iridium make up the balance of the six year revenue or $5 million. 16:10 The sales adjustment for the period is calculated on the answers that were delivered in the last three months of the 2021 financial year and recorded at the last price received in June, but only invoiced in July August and September. So the pullback in the rhodium price in September had a negative impact on our revenue for the past 6 months. 16:35 The SDO operating cash cost per ounce increased 32% to $815 per ounce compared to H1 2021. A portion of this increase is due to the strengthening of the average rent dollar by 7% [Indiscernible]. So if you look at the cost in Rand terms, our cash was increased 23% with the main contributors being that 15% increase in electricity mining costs that were higher due to the subsidy paid to the host mine and as we said at year end results presentation was on a trial basis and has subsequently stopped so that that cost will be reduced. 17:16 We had higher consumable costs which are incurred as a result of more wrong material at the Lenox bronze. annual payroll increases were effective in July 2021 and then we had to higher maintenance costs as a result of course a material feed being processed to some of the clients. Converting at an average exchange rate of 15.29 to the dollar and forecasting a full year costing at around $790 per ounce. The 2023 and 24 cost per ounce is an illustrative guide based on our forecast answers as well as the current exchange rates. 18:00 Then the table on the right just gives a breakdown of the five largest direct costs of operations for the six months with employee cost accounting for 32% of total direct operating costs and then followed by GTT. The group EBITDA as with revenue and cost per ounce, the EBITDA was impacted by lower ounce production and lower process with a period as well as slightly higher costs. The full year EBITDA is estimated at just about $100 million and has been adjusted for the revision in production for the financial year, again between 2023 and 2024 EBITDA estimates are an illustrative God based on the current exchange rates, and spot prices in February 2022 and the higher focus answers produced following the commissioning of the Lesedi, MF2 and Tweefontein. 18:59 Our cash flow was remained strong despite the production challenges. For the reporting period operating profit before capital was $36.4 million working capital increased $6.7 million, net interest income of $700,000 and we paid our taxes of $12 million. Investing Activities comprise capital strings of $6.1 million on operations, capital projects and SIB and then $1.3 million on exploration. 19:32 The company also spent $2.4 million on share buybacks and paid out $14.6 million in December for the annual dividends for financial year 2021. Looking forward to the second half of the financial year, cash flows will be impacted by the ounce production and Basket price. The higher voice get price in February will have a favorable effect on cash flow for answers produced in November December. Higher capital spend and outflow is four possible growth projects income tax and mineral water tax payable June will affect the cash flow for the next 6 months as well. And then lastly, the payment of the windfall dividends in April and any other potential cash capital returns to shareholders expense. 20:24 There hasn't been too much change to the capital forecast for the full year compared to the presentation in September. We incurred little additional capital on the temporary tailings facility at Lesedi and much of this will be reallocated to the new facility. The full cost remains at around $22 million for the full year and $16 million for 2023. And this includes the MF2 for Lesedi and Tweefontein and then the three tailings dams which are inside. 20:58 On exploration capital for 2022 is the drilling program that commenced last year. As we still awaiting the final results on this program, which are due July this year. We haven't planned any further exploration capital and that will be dealt with in the new financial year. 21:23 And looking at our ESG. In our 2021 annual reports replenished our heart rates ESG report confirming our commitment to ESG, and sustainable mining based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And each reporting period we aim to provide updates and on our progress whilst aligning our ESG risks, opportunities and exposure areas to the company's values, as well as the ICMM guiding principles. 21:54 The very nature of our business reducing the impact of mineral waste – or impact that mineral waste dumps have on the environment. The reworking of the dams and read depositing on the same footprint for more enhanced facilities reduces the environmental impact of these dams and also reduces the potential secrets or spillage as we continuously monitor and upgrade these facilities. 22:20 In addition to this, the company also makes financial provision for final rehabilitation of these facilities, and we just commissioned the trial project to revegetate the dumps with suitable plants and seeds and ultimately creates a natural habitat to attract insects and small animals. But they stopped studying for this was completed during the reporting period and a start at one of our clients has already been allocated to start the trial. 22:48 The main focus of the company with regard to our carbon transition currently is energy optimization and investigating renewable energy. So when is current emission calculations are based on Scope 1 and 2 emission sources from Eskom diesel generation and diesel used and are below acceptable thresholds? 23:10 Management intends to focus on reducing energy intensity through optimization of processes, the possible reduction and replacement of Scope 1 and 2 energy sources with greener alternatives, and ultimately the recovery of emissions. This is a long-term goal, but small projects already in place that will be implemented, such as power factor correction installed at 83% of their plans, new lighting installations utilizing lower low energy led, and then studies have been initiated at two plans to assess the suitability of possible feeding plans to supplement daily power usage. 23:53 Under the social banner, the company grew its local community employment by 27%. With funded or are finding a number of learnerships or work based learning programs. There was a small increase in women in mining during the reporting period and company aims to increase this even further going forward. We've continued our community projects with focus on schools feeding schemes, business development of community businesses and awareness programs, including World AIDS Day, 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children, and all the day to name a few. The company also launched an employee wellness program post period end, we identified the need for this program optimizing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of people in general. The program goes beyond COVID and provides unlimited telephone counselling covering work, personal emotional trauma, dealing with illness and dependency, and also provides financial planning advice face to face counselling with necessary and legal advice. 25:07 In respect of safety, although the lost time injury frequency rate reduced in comparison to the prior financial year, the company did have one [Indiscernible] employee of a contractor onsite [Indiscernible]. The plants do run regular safety campaigns, and they are well supported by employees and contractors. And the government that company is in the process of formalizing its ESG reporting Toolkit. In addition, the company is continuously updating and improving its existing policies Germany's with stakeholder expectations, and to ensure legal compliance. We had no section 54 or section 55 stoppages are instructions from the Department of mineral resources and in terms of our economic contributions in South Africa, the company paid $377 million to supplies in South Africa and both OpEx and CapEx, ZAR 155 million was paid to employees and in taxes and contributions on behalf of employees. And ZAR 329 million was paid in income tax VAT, mineral water tax and dividend withholding tax. 26:25 Webinar ESG is ESG reporting is ongoing and we looking forward to publishing a report [Indiscernible] community and confidence.\\nJaco Prinsloo: 26:47 Thank you very much Lewanne and I think let us have a quick look at the PGM basket process and in the market and also where to from here. I think very briefly, just a recap on the Prill Splits we've had earlier in the presentation as well. But it puts in perspective, when you look at the price trend at the bottom, we have the big increase, especially Erodium. That purple line in the bottom of the graph increased about mid last year, and then the sharp decline they after. But fortunately, we have started seeing uptick again since early this year. And I'll explain that a bit more in terms of the fundamentals on the next slide. But just you know you can see our Odium is 56% of our revenue for the past year. Our impact on the price of rhodium because we are pro is a good splits. So when it was all going well, and rhodium is up it's all positive and when rhodium is declining. It does have a negative side to results. 27:56 So when we look at a market and where we think the price will go I think it's important to understand in the metals that we deal with in the form a significant part of our basket. What drives that I think palladium and rhodium in very much getting together with the auto catalysts sales rates a significant portion 83% and 91% or setback roughly on the demand. And that was heavily impacted during the past year with a slowdown in internal combustion vehicle sales that was impacted by the global chip shortage. But we have seen as the sales are starting to improve and also forecast to improve significantly during the year, we have seen recovery starting in these metals and with analysts forecasting these metals to remain in deficit. For the short to medium term, we're quite positive that we should still experience robust process on palladium rhodium and some yes, we fully aware that battery electric vehicles are a threat to the internal combustion engine that [Indiscernible]. 29:07 But, you have to also look structurally at the capacity of producers to produce the necessary battery metals, your nickel, cobalt, lithium, etc to double the batteries and also as a result of the supply and demand or the increasing process. And we've seen very sharp increases already and those are factors that might slow down the battery electric vehicle rollout, they will list as I said, for the short-to-medium term, we're quite confident in the palladium and rhodium market. The Platinum on the other side of being in surplus at the price was more under pressure in recent years, however, with Platinum’s role in both us and industrial, chemical applications, and also the opportunity where some suppliers are looking at substitution from palladium to platinum in some more tickets. That is the demand for platinum we're looking for going forward is forecast to increase and I think, analysts vary slightly in the forecast. But between 5 and 7 years, we expect the Palladium price – the platinum price to increase more platinum plays quite a big role in the hydrogen economy in the sense of hydrogen catalysts, both in industrial catalysts and also in fuel cell vehicles. 30:31 So we'll keep our eye on that. And I think just when you look at some of the prices, we've heard from a few institutions, I think this first one the platinum and Standard Bank – Standard Bank corporate banks forecasts in terms of platinum, especially the long-term increasing is in line with that expected demand increase and Olbermann netbank have a more stable outlook. And then palladium and rhodium, you can see both have a declining profile, but still significantly higher than historic levels. While gold is quite flat, and but it's a minor portion, there's not 1% in our overall basket. 31:12 So in general, I think we were the process is at the moment, we don't anticipate the process necessarily to go back to where we've seen them in the first half of last calendar year. But we do believe there'll be remained significantly stronger than we've seen in recent years. So if we look at the strategy and our outlook going forward, we obviously remain committed to return significant value to our shareholders. And we do that in the sense of creating positive – generate positive guests and returning value to the shareholders both by means of dividends. And we've done both NL and windfall dividends, and also regular share buybacks. And also by not going back to the market to ask for money to fund our growth projects. We haven't had the need to raise any capital in the market since 2009 and all our growth up to now has been funded from internal cash resources completely. So we want to maintain and continue with an annual stable sustainable annual dividend and a progressive dividend. For shareholders, we continue to generate cash there and then as we've done with this particular windfall, we have higher than anticipated metal prices, compared to consensus values for a period, we would look at sharing, again, additional money with our shareholders. And then obviously, you know, since 2015, we've had almost 50 million – 49 million shares that we bought back of which we cancelled nearly 13 million shares, retained by the shareholder so that's a philosophy that we will continue to do, obviously, in order to maintain flows back to our shareholders. We have to ensure that we continue generating profits and that we have a sustainable business going forward. And we do that in three ways. Firstly, with the normal R&D and press optimization initiatives where we focus on our existing operations, making them more efficient, and doing certain modifications employing new technology so that we can get more out of them and I think there's only two that is the way we've since about 2014, or the same number of operations managed to increase our rounds profile, from about 45,000 ounce to over 70,000 ounces, and in recent years, and do that affect to MF2 projects, Lesedi and Tweefontein projects that are discussed already earlier in the presentation, he is looking to roll out in the in the short-term. Also, the fine chrome opportunity I've spoken about this is something that can follow in the short term approach, and then also feeding dump source into existing operations. 34:03 If you look more longer-term, and in terms of expanding capacity and creating longer life of mine, we've been over the years engaging with a number of third parties in the industry, to look at adding resources to our program and we are confident that both from the eastern and western levels respectively, that we're able to add those resources in the timeframe suggested that could add between 10,000 ounces and 20,000 ounces a year each. If we progress them, and we've currently busy with investigations on them, and if anyone on specific commercial terms will decide on how we roll out and what form it will take in terms of both funding from capital, we do have I've given them because the figure of say between $20 million and $25 million is what we expect on each of these projects, to bring them to commissioning. And, with our current cash generation forecasts that on cash reserves, we should be able to fund our projects and maintain a stable dividend. When we look longer-term, and probably deviating slightly from the current dump and current earnings business is the longer-term inspiration projects, that those are two mineral projects for which we own the mining rights – approved mining rights or they have been granted and that is purchased up in the northern limb. And we've had them for a number of years. Obviously, I explained that the previous periods of our original business model was a lot more bullish, and we were prepared to take a lot more risk by building our own smelters and refineries or the intention to do it in the regional scope or some 12 years ago. But that's highly capital intensive and higher risk. 35:49 So we have in recent years and over the last two years decided we can rather look at focusing on the high-grade area, so these are losses. So we stating the resource statement so that we can produce a higher grade concentrate that saleable to existing smelters and refineries, without us to having incur the cost and risk of own internal either metallurgical in Parliament political infrastructure and that's what we're looking at these projects. Obviously, from a timeline perspective, you would remember, I've announced earlier, when we launched the specialist studies on Prill Split and the northern Prill Split study outcomes we expected expecting during the next 6 months, we should be able to restate the resources and reserve to acceptable limits that we are able to make a decision on how we want to progress with the project. 36:44 The Northern Limb entailed some additional drilling, and those drilling work has been concluded at the end of December. And we're busy with logging analysis and sampling at the moment on all those things. And then we will also hopefully, by year end of geological results to share and then a couple of months later, we will be able to have the money models run on that as well. 37:13 These projects, I think it's important to stress that, looking at the capital requirement to them and also the size is we – as a board will make a decision once we have the feedback on the studies and the results per se. Does that fit into our current strategy of being profitable, low risk and sustainable projects for the current business to do in in-house resources or do we say this in you need to partner maybe you're one of the bigger players in the market to progress them or potentially sell them or throw them out in a different vehicle. So those decisions have not been made yet and it's premature to decide that now before we have all the final information. But certainly what we do believe is that it is quality resources. It is shallow resources as I said they are open but of all they can be opencast mining so the near surface and the philosophy change we made is that we can produce grants that are sellable to the current market. So this just hopefully give you a flavor of this is significant potential life, there is growth and I'm confident that, with well proven record over the years of growing the business to where we are that we will be able to continue to grow it. 38:35 Finally, just maybe inclusion as the option as I mentioned earlier, production is key for us to ensure that we are able to continue to fund our growth aspirations, also that we are able to fund shareholder returns. We believe the PGM market is robust enough, though, for us to support us in that regard, from strategic point of view is focusing on the things we can control, production, operating cost, and a product rollout and more importantly, in the last couple of years, in recent years, there's been a strong focus on specific strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties and also we have identified external growth opportunities. And we continue to build on those, and then to have sustainable shareholder value and both in the form of dividends and share buybacks. 39:29 And you can see in the capital allocation at the bottom that just our capital committed is specifically for those strategic projects, new tailings storage facilities like this, I'll be in exploration assets, you will see there is no capital and a capital slide, which they uncovered. There's no additional capital for operational projects, currently in our estimates – forward looking estimates and it's purely because we haven't added any additional answers for it in our current estimates. So those things will be determined once we bring those projects finalization. 40:00 And then finally, it always remains a decision in a key consideration for us to be able to fund evidence and share buybacks that we have adequate cash available. So yes, that brings us to the – to the end of the presentation, and I think…\\nOperator: 40:17 Jaco and Lewanne. Thank you very much for your presentation this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, please do continue to submit your questions using the Q&A tab. It's just situates on the right hand corner of your screen. But just while the company take a few moments to review those questions already submitted, I'd like to remind you the recording of this presentation along with a copy of the slides and the published Q&A can be accessed by your investor dashboard. Jaco and Lewanne, we've received a number of pre-submitted questions from investors. And I wanted to start off the Q&A session with these.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 40:45 The first one I believe you touched on in the presentation. But maybe if you could write a bit more color, will the management team be looking at share buybacks moving forward?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 40:56 Yes, thank you, Jake (ph). No, as I said, it is a key consideration for us. And when we look at the current best cash position and capital requirements, we have agreed to make a sizable amount available for share buybacks in the near future, we'll always approach them on opportunity basis, we believe we can add value to shareholders. So that's something we will continue, and the board is committed to doing. And I think also positive in that regard is taking the balance of shares currently in Treasury that have to you need for employee share schemes and remuneration going forward. We don't need to buy any shares back for that, if initially as we would buy back in future would be canceled, and therefore add value.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 41:46 Thank you. The second question that we received pre submitted was, are any of the planned work overs or developments on unexploited assets expected to make any significant improvement to ounces produced? Or are these works just expected to keep us near current output?\\nLewanne Carminati: 42:03 Yeah, look, I think that's important one, and I, without us having to have the exact apart from that project pipeline, the idea is that it's not just sustaining current level, we you have inflationary cross bridges over the time and if you're going to stay at the same production levels or declining production levels, you will erode your margins going forward. So the key is always to say, Listen, how do we grow the business more, and I think we've always had a growth plan. And in this last two years, it was unfortunate significantly hampered firstly, by COVID and then by the host mine cut back, otherwise, we would have seen the growth on our profiles, but we're also looking at a more significant growth going forward and into the projects that we're looking to add on the profile. So I think, when we shared profile earlier, we were looking at between 60,000 ounces and 70,000 ounces for about 7 to 10 years. We're after as most of our primary dump sources are curating your life anymore on current devices and dump it probably would have tapered down to say 40,000 ounces to 50,000 ounces, adding additional plants to the tune of 15 or 10,000 ounces to 20,000 ounces on Eastern Western and respectively, you suddenly move your margin to stay over, say about 100,000 ounces and then even longer-term, you can add the expression of projects if we decide to continue then even on top of that, so certainly the idea is to grow the profile rather than just maintaining the profile and replacing existing production. So, I hope that answered the question.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 43:39 That's great. The final pre submitted question that we have here reads as follows. The Global Automakers the signaling a massive ramp up in production this year, hopefully, basket price will be robust as a result, how can Sylvania take advantage of this could output be increased temporarily to build stocks and position to sell into high into high basket price?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 44:00 Look, so that is, unfortunately, the flexibility is not that great? That way, suddenly, we can change our production plans to suit the market. The Prill Splits and others ratio of the platinum palladium rhodium in our orders are quite consistent and constant. So this unfortunate opportunity for us to do that, what we can do in what we continuously do is to evaluate, we often get approached by third parties to say, they have higher grade material, maybe from operations, whether the treatment facilities and can you treat it. And if we have an operation, for instance, we currently treating a low grade dump material, and you're able to substitute their feed with a higher grade material and then the incremental value we generate makes sense for both parties. Certainly, those are things we continuously evaluate and from our own mining perspectives, we can look at our own resources and CIP, we can optimize rates. But unfortunately, it's not huge flexibility in that regard. But it remains a consideration in how we approach our food sources and their business plans.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:09 That's great. Thank you so much for that, if I may, could I please ask you to open up that Q&A tab, which is on the right hand corner of your screen. As you can see, we received a number of questions throughout today's presentation and thank you once again, to all investors for submitting those questions. If I could please ask you to read out the questions and give response where it's appropriate to do so. And I'll pick up from you at the end. Thank you.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:32 Okay, so I'm looking at one of the things, but I think maybe while I was talking, I don't know if it's been answered. So there was a question from David, say, you say you are using excess cash to buy back shares, or the shares being cancelled or held in Treasury and buybacks that to be to be having a positive impact on the share price. And I think I have indicated that, you know, we have sufficient trades and priority to fulfill the needs of our share schemes. So obviously, we would be looking at cancelling them and I know there's been a big debate of does the cancelling add value or not, we certainly have a number of our institutions shell as I said, they prefer the buyback over the dividends, this other search engines prefer the dividend. And we always try to maintain a balance. And that's also I would say, it's also just to have opportunistic approach to it and see, when in the spells, we'll be dealing with a lower share price that we do the buyback thing. And sometimes shareholders perceive it as not having any impact, but you put it well, at the share price declining further divide, that's not happened. So again that answer to the question from David.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 46:46 That was, David, if on the screen I see this a next question from David [Indiscernible] I'm not sure if the same David or another one. And he asked, and you can probably along the similar lines, can you comment on the poor valuation of the share price and why this is what I believe is a he said earnings of only for?\\nLewanne Carminati: 47:05 And I think these leaning shoulders that raised their frustration about the valuation of the share price in recent years. And I mean, that's something we also try to work on, unfortunately, conflict roller, the share price, it's based on, on how the market perceive the value. But what I do think is, once you're able to have more tangible resources, I mean, we believe that the growth is there. But for analysts and investors to make proper long-term forecast, it always helps to have proper reserves and resources available. So there's a timeline is a clear indication of how much you have and for how long it will last, and I'm – I'm hoping that even next in this next year, we will be able to bring a lot more of that to the table whereas we update our resources on our exploration projects, we can do it the third part is re-engaging with approved the resource and reserve statements of that work and I think that will help shield us to ever a clear line of sight in terms of what our business is based on. It's always been difficult with our current arrangement of those mines, where you operate, to show you a commercial, confidential commercial agreement. And it's a private list of companies so they don't disclose any of their operations. And I believe that might be a big impact on why we're not seeing the valuation as strong as it could be, and understandably so. But I do think the situation that should improve going forward.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 48:42 I think this, the next question I see is from Michael D. He says, are you continuing to experience cost pressures in the business?\\nLewanne Carminati: 48:50 Look, obviously, I mentioned first one for us is the fact that we have a large, fixed cost portion. So obviously, when the answers are down, we are under pressure, there's our unit costs to hire from the external points. Yes, we've had recently a 15% increase in electricity. We have, our global national utility have asked or applied for a 20% increase rate for the next financial year and that's currently still have to be approved by the authorities. I think, a lot of the local analysts believe that they probably wouldn't be approved. But in any case, the electricity has been higher than standard inflation, the last few years. So electricity always remain a cost pressure. We fortunate enough that from a labor perspective, our labor portion is lower than typical conventional underground mines and we've been since we started the company, I've been able to always conclude wage negotiations on a reasonable industry related values. And so labor have also been in fine. I think on the projects, we see a bet on post [Indiscernible] supply of steel in electronics, and those kind of things a bit more of increase in prices. But from those normal running operations, the highest cost project is probably electricity demand. Thank God, if I look at my drop down screen, that's probably the…\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 50:35 Yes, I was just gonna say thank you for addressing all those questions that you can from investors today. And, of course, ladies and gentlemen, the company will have the opportunity to provide answers to any further questions where they believe it is appropriate to do so. And they'll be available on the investment company platform. Jaco perhaps before redirecting investors to provide their feedback, which is particularly important to the company. Can I please ask you for a few closing comments to wrap up with, thank you?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 50:58 Yeah, thank you, Jake. I think there's a sector as always, it's – it's a great opportunity for us to engage with investors and I said it before this platform, since COVID have provided us the opportunity to reach many more than we could do with an additional roadshow going for Lewanne. So thank you very much, then I think, looking over the results for the passport, although it's a robust set of results. These definitely room for improvement. And I hope that we have given the shell this assurance that we know exactly where the areas are and that we are putting adequate and sufficient plans in place to address them. And also, I hope that the chairman's can see that these are the of quite a solid, sustainable and attractive growth profile of us. And I'm sure we will be able to return value to our shareholders in significant value for many years to come. So thanks for the confidence. Thanks for the support. And thanks for the opportunity.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 52:05 Jaco and Lewanne, thank you very much for updating investors this afternoon. Could I please ask investors not to close this session as you'll now be automatically redirected for the opportunity to provide your feedback and all that the management team can better understand your views and expectations? It's going to take a few months to complete, I'm sure will be greatly valued by the company. On behalf of the management team of Sylvania Platinum Limited. We'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation.\",\n",

My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating your call today.  0:26 I will now hand you over to host, Matt Funke to begin. Matt, please go ahead.\\nMatthew Funke: 00:32 Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Funke, CFO with Southern Missouri. Thank you for joining us. The purpose of our call this morning is to review the information and data presented in our quarterly earnings release dated Monday, October twenty five, twenty twenty one and to take your questions. 00:48 We may make certain forward-looking statements during today's call, and we refer you to our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements contained in the press release. I'm joined on the call today by Greg Steffens, our President and CEO, and Greg will lead off our conversation with commentary on our current operations, our lending activity and our credit quality measures.\\nGreg Steffens: 01:10 Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. Again, I'm Greg Steffens and I want to thank you for joining us this morning. Since our last call, public health authorities in our region did report a peak in COVID cases from mid to late August and now been reporting substantial declines over the last eight weeks. We continue to see few restrictions on business activity in our primary markets and our operations have been much less impacted since our prior call. 01:42 We again remain positive about our credit profile and borrower performance. We continue to see limited number of relationships operating under modified terms under the CARES Act. We have four loans continuing under interest only modifications and are to borrowers in the hotel industry and totaled just under twenty four million dollars. We continue to analyze this portfolio closely and we have continued to see improvement by most of these customers. 02:13 PPP forgiveness continued in the September quarter. The release notes that we received almost thirty seven million dollars in PPP forgiveness during the September quarter, down slightly from the prior two months -- two quarters and twenty six million dollars in PPP loans remain outstanding. Accelerated fee recognition picked up some in the September quarter as the average fee was higher on second round loans that made up a larger percentage of those loans forgiven. As of September thirty, eighty seven percent of our PPP loans originated in both rounds one and two had been forgiven. 02:56 Our non-performing loans were slightly higher this quarter, up about three hundred thousand, but offsetting that was our adversely classified loans were slightly lower down from the prior quarter by one million dollars to seventeen point one million dollars, a year ago, they were twenty five million dollars. Past due loans were higher, but only modestly, so they totaled four point eight million dollars, which represented twenty one basis points on a loan portfolio, which is up from seventeen basis points in the prior quarter, a year ago, they totaled six point nine million dollars or thirty two basis points. 03:37 Any loans still requiring relief under the CARES Act are included as special mention credits and along with watch credits. These combined categories were at thirty nine point three million dollars at September thirty down from forty eight point four million dollars at June thirty and fifty point nine million dollars a year ago. 03:59 For agricultural update, ag production and other loans to farmers were up almost twenty two million dollars in the quarter and up five million dollars compared to this same period of last year. While ag real estate balances were up about five million dollars over the quarter and three million dollars compared to the September thirty of last year. Our agricultural borrowers are in the middle of harvest season and lenders node average to higher yields in their fall progress performance. 04:30 Our corn harvest is mostly complete and yielding one hundred and seventy five to two hundred bushel an acre for non-irrigated ground, and in the two fifty bushels an acre per irrigated ground. Pricing has being at five point five dollars to six dollars a bushel. Rice is mostly complete and yielding in the one hundred and eighty bushel am acre for conventional rice varieties and two twenty for our hybrid varieties. Pricing at this time is from six to six twenty five a bushel. 05:03 The soybean harvest is about halfway complete, yielding forty five to sixty bushel an acre for non-irrigated ground and as high as eighty dollars or eighty bushels an acre for irrigated ground. Pricings range from twelve dollars to thirteen dollars a bushel and some farmers are actually running into issues with elevators not accepting soybeans until they ship out corn and rice by rail or barge. Some farmers have on farm storage, but others may be slower to complete the harvest that they can't deliver directly to the elevators. 05:40 The cotton harvest is just beginning that we expect results in line with the last several years at twelve hundred pounds an acre on the less productive ground and fourteen hundred pounds an acre on the more productive ground. And pricing is zero point seven eight dollars to zero point eight two dollars a pound. Pricing remained well above where we completed our underwriting from corn, soybeans and cotton specifically and modestly above underwriting from rice. 06:07 The most significant downside risk for our borrowers that we see at this time is twenty twenty two production costs and higher input costs or supply chain issues may cause some farmers to alter their crop production scheduled from corn to soybeans over the next year. But we're all even with reduced government payments this year, we expect our farmers to have a more profitable twenty twenty one and twenty twenty where they performed well. 06:41 Matt, would you like to give us an update on our financial results?\\nMatthew Funke: 06:45 Okay, Great. We earned a one point four three dollars diluted in the September quarter. September is the first quarter of our fiscal year. And that resulted down zero point one zero dollars from the linked June quarter, but up zero point three four dollars from the one point nine dollars that we earned in the September twenty twenty quarter. A year ago, we had a charge to earnings for our provision for credit losses as compared to a modest recovery with a negative provision in the current period, although, it's down from a larger negative provision in the linked June quarter. 07:17 Our net interest margin in the September quarter was four point zero one percent which is about, which included about six basis points of contribution from fair value discount accretion on acquired loan books or three hundred and seventy six thousand dollars in dollar terms. Also as forgiveness of PPP loans continued, we accelerated the origination fee accretion on those loans adding another two point two million dollars to interest income which contributed thirty four basis points to the margins. 07:51 In the year ago period, our margin was three point seven three percent of which six basis points resulted from fair value discount creation and has three hundred and thirty nine thousand and PPP loans weren't yet in the forgiveness process at that time. So, on what we see as a core basis, our margin was down almost seven basis points comparing September twenty one to September of twenty. We see our core loan yield as declining twenty eight basis points, while our core cost of deposits was down forty seven and our core total cost of funds down a similar forty eight basis points, but higher average cash balances drove the decline in the margin reducing our total interest earning asset yield, which dropped by thirty nine basis points outside of discount accretion or accelerated recognition of PPP origination fees. 08:44 In the linked June quarter, we reported a margin of three seventy four that included a bit more discount accretion than the current quarter, adding seven basis points to margin, but we also saw less contribution than this quarter from accelerated recognition of PPP fees and it had contributed twenty basis points in that quarter. So on what we would consider of course sequential basis, we see an increase of about fourteen basis points and we would note that about a third of that improvement is due to the current ninety two day quarter as compared to the ninety one day quarter in June. 09:20 Non-interest interest income was down four hundred twenty six thousand dollars compared to the year ago period. We saw continuing declines in gains on sale of residential loans originated for that purpose and their related servicing income. Increases in deposit service charges and bank card interchange income offset some of that decline. A net gain on fixed assets of one hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars was recorded on the sale of bank properties and compared to the linked quarter deposit service charges were higher while interchange income was lower, and servicing income was lower on the inclusion in June’s results of a positive fair value adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights. 10:00 Non-interest income was up one million dollars compared to the year ago quarter, increases were mostly attributable to compensation, occupancy, data a processing and advertising. Compared to the linked quarter, non-interest expense was little changed as higher compensation and occupancy was offset by lower legal and professional charges and advertising expenses. We reported no net charge offs in the September quarter, down even from the very low net charge off figure in the June quarter. Our trailing twelve month figure moved lower to two basis points, which is just under zero point five million dollars in dollar terms of net charge offs over the last year. 10:42 Loan growth was a bit slower in the current quarter, but remained at solid annualized pace for a second consecutive quarter and even though we realized loan growth are continued positive credit metrics along with the stabilized projection for economic recovery indicated that a negative provision for credit losses was appropriate for the quarter, although, as we noted it was quite a bit lower at three hundred and five thousand in recovery down from two point six million dollars in the June quarter. 11:09 On the balance sheet, gross loan balances were up forty nine million dollars in the September quarter, getting nuts off to a good start for the new fiscal year, even while PPP balances dropped almost thirty seven million dollars. Compared to September thirty of twenty, gross loan balances were up ninety six million dollars or four point four percent. PPP balances were down one hundred and seven million dollars over the same twelve months, so if you adjusted for that, our annualized rate of growth or annual rate of growth for the year would be close to ten percent outside of PPP. 11:43 Investment portfolio grows slowed this quarter, but did remain positive. The negative provision along with our loan growth moved our allowances of percentage of gross loans down six basis points from the linked quarter to one point four three percent at September thirty, as a percentage of gross loans outside of PPP, it was down nine basis points over the linked quarter to one point four four percent, 12:09 Deposits rebounded in the September quarter with forty one million dollars in growth reversing the June quarters decline. Our brokerage funding was unchanged while public unit deposits were down more than nine million dollars. Non-maturity balances were up forty nine million dollars in the quarter after a modest decline in the June quarter, but following on strong growth in the December and March quarters. Outside of broker, there were at two ninety seven million dollars over the last twelve months, which is almost a twenty percent rate of growth. 12:39 Time deposits still moved lower down eight million dollar that this was a notably slower pace than in recent periods. And over the last twelve months, they're down seventy seven million dollars outside of brokered, which is a twelve percent decline. FHLB borrowings declined eleven million dollars from the prior quarter and are down almost thirty nine million dollars from twelve months earlier. 13:02 Our tangible equity ratio increased by about twenty basis points during the quarter, as repurchased activity remained limited, income remains strong and total asset growth was limited. Our risk based ratios are relatively stable as we generally redeployed zero risk weighted assets, cash and SBA guaranteed loans into one hundred percent risk weight loans. 13:27 Greg, final comments.\\nGreg Steffens: 13:29 Thanks, Matt. Overall, we're very pleased with the loan growth totals that you've mentioned, and we feel like we're off to a good start for the new fiscal year. Seasonal lag draws were helpful again this last quarter and we also retained about six million dollars of residential loans that we normally would have sold in the secondary market. 13:49 Single and multi-family residential combined for about forty one million dollars our loan growth. Commercial balances dropped on the PPP forgiveness payments and we also saw construction lines payoff. Our East region saw some of the largest PPP payments received and outside of that factor all three regions contributed strongly to loan growth led by our South region. 14:17 Our outlook for the December quarter remains quite strong as our pipeline for loans to fund in ninety days was one hundred and eighty one million dollars at September thirty. Higher than where we stood at June thirty and about fifty percent higher and at the same time last year. With ag paydowns coming, we'll see some seasonal offset for the next several quarters and we should see PPP payments continue to come in over this timeframe. 14:48 We budgeted for between four percent to five percent growth outside of PPP forgiveness in fiscal twenty twenty two, but we currently believe there's a good chance that we will exceed those figures. Our non-owner CRE concentration was approximately two hundred and seventy two percent of regulatory capital at September thirty, relatively unchanged as compared to June thirty and as compared to two hundred and sixty seven percent one year ago. 15:17 In the current quarter, our loan growth in the relevant categories in total was in line with our consolidated capital growth. Strong growth in multi-family was offset by construction payoffs. Our volume of loan originations was about two hundred and nineteen million dollars in the September quarter, down from higher levels in the June and March quarters when we reported some second round PPP activity. In the same quarter of a year ago, we originated two zero five million dollars that compares. 15:51 We continue to expect some deposit runoff in the near term as depositors utilize some of their additional liquidity that they're sitting on. Traditionally, we do see that September quarter is our weakest for deposit growth in December and March quarters to be much stronger. So seasonal factors may offset some anticipated runoff over the next several quarters. Time deposit balances showed some signs of stabilization after four quarters or more of significant declines. Our excess reserves trended back a bit higher in October, and remain somewhat above where we would normally want to see them. First quarter growth in non-maturity deposits was strongest in the West region but outside our public unit deposits was positive across all three of our regions. 16:46 Finally, we pleased that we recently announced our definitive agreement to partner with Fortune Bank, which is headquartered in Arnold, Missouri, which is in Jefferson County portion of the St. Louis MSA and with the second facility in Oak Hill, which is in the South St Louis County. We are looking forward to serving Fortune customers into the growth opportunities supported to us in that market, as we work with the Fortune team, as well as utilizing their team members to help improve our services offered across our legacy footprint. We do expect this transaction to close in mid-February, subject to all customary regulatory requirements. 17:30 In Cairo Illinois, we did reach an agreement to acquire the branch location of First National Bank, which will provide a modest amount of funding in core deposits. And as we consolidate locations provide a more sustainable footprint in that community. We expect to close on that transaction in mid-January. At this time, we are open to look at other potential partnerships if something attractive, comes along and fits our expansion plans. Matt?\\nMatthew Funke: 18:01 Thank you, Greg. And Lauren, at this time, we're ready to take questions from our participants. So if you would remind folks on how they can queue for questions.\\nOperator: 18:31 Of course.  Our first question comes from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. Andrew, your line is now open.\\nAndrew Liesch: 18:38 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. How are you?\\nGreg Steffens: 18:37 Good morning, Andrew.\\nAndrew Liesch: 18:45 Question on the loan pipeline up nicely year-over-year, what do you think driving that, that typically stronger and you might normally see this time of the year?\\nGreg Steffens: 18:57 We've had a lot of people that decided to redeploy cash where we were receiving a lot of prepayment activity from some of our customers in our West region. They’ve become more active at reacquiring properties, again, a lot of the pipeline has been in multi-family, a lot of low income housing tax credit projects that they're buying that they are converting to market rents.\\nAndrew Liesch: 19:30 Okay. Good to hear the loan demand there. And then obviously, some bounding round on the different non-interest income categories from quarter-to-quarter. How do you see that I mean, if you take out the gain on the sale of the former branches, how do you see that four point four million dollars total playing out? It seems like there's -- maybe service charges might be a little bit higher as it was this quarter, but how do you see interchange in gain on loan sales playing also next two quarters?\\nMatthew Funke: 20:05 I think that secondary market activity, we probably or obviously will pass the peak on that. So don't want to overestimate where we may be able to run on that. I think deposit, service charges, bank charge and bank card interchange income, those are probably sustainable numbers nothing particularly unusual as we get into the new calendar year, we generally see a little bit of the drop off on deposit service charges.\\nAndrew Liesch: 20:39 Got it. Those are my questions I'll step back. Thanks.\\nMatthew Funke: 20:44 Thank you, Andrew.\\nOperator: 20:56  Our next question comes from Kelly Motta from KBW. Kelly, your line is now open.\\nKelly Motta: 21:04 Hi. Thanks for the question. My first one has to do with the capital and buybacks. It looks like buybacks slowed a bit this quarter. Just wondering your approach to deploying the buyback, while the deal is currently pending, I know you have a ton of capital, but just wanted to know kind of thoughts with employing that where valuation is and with the deal is that on the table?\\nMatthew Funke: 21:38 With the pending acquisition, giving stock in that we do have to be conscious of when that proxy with solicitation period begin, as we exit from our  period, our understanding is that we can be active and we're always going to look at the relative value of acquiring that stock and what payback period is on that versus holding onto that capital for some potential future use as well.\\nKelly Motta: 22:07 Great. And then maybe if you could add a few comments on the  branch acquisition, just we'll motivated that if there's potential saves from changing your location there or just anything to kind of help us out? Thanks.\\nGreg Steffens: 22:27 On the  location, There's two banks in  First National and our facility was in need of some significant rehabilitation and they actually approached us about us acquiring their location and they have a bigger location that would more fit a consolidated operation. And then on top of that, they have close to thirty million dollars in deposits, which was very similar in size to what we have and we felt like that there's some efficiencies that can be gained by combining the two operations into one.\\nKelly Motta: 23:12 Great. Thanks for the color, Greg. Maybe just one last one on expenses, they were really well controlled on this quarter. Can you remind me any seasonality you have with the start of the year and kind of have you think about that progression, clearly done a nice job getting some positive operating leverage with expense control, but just wondering kind of how to -- if you could remind me on the seasonality of expenses would be helpful? Thank you.\\nMatthew Funke: 23:44 Sure. We do generally reassess employee compensation beginning in January, that along with resetting the clock on payroll taxes, usually does cause us to pick up a bigger percentage of our annual compensation expense build there. And then like everybody we're dealing with competition for talent right now and so I would expect that compared to normal we would see maybe a little more of a build on that line item than what we have over previous years.\\nKelly Motta: 24:20 Thanks, Matt. Appreciate it.\\nMatthew Funke: 24:23 You're welcome.\\nOperator: 24:37  We now have a follow-up question from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. Andrew, your line is now.\\nAndrew Liesch: 24:45 Thanks guys for taking my follow-up. Just on the core margin, obviously, it’s a nice expansion here. How do you see that that playing out for the next couple of quarters? What are some of the puts and takes driving that in this large expansion possible?\\nMatthew Funke: 25:03 I think that will be driven a lot by cash position. There is some upside there for redeployment. We've done a good job bringing our deposit costs down a little faster than what we've seen on the loan book. We appreciate what we're seeing on the yield curve right now with the longer term moving up that should be beneficial to our loan pricing, two months ago, where the yield curve was, we would have thought there might have been more potential for downward reprising on the loan book than what we would see on the deposit portfolio. So, I think we're more optimistic now than we probably for the twelve to eighteen month period. And what we were a couple of months ago, really, I think our number one go on, it would just be maintained.\\nAndrew Liesch: 25:52 Got it. Cool. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Thank you for the call today. I'll step back.\\nMatthew Funke: 25:59 Thanks, Andrew.\\nOperator: 26:04 Okay. We currently have no further questions. I'll now hand back over to the host for any closing remarks.\\nMatthew Funke: 26:10 Okay. Thank you, Lauren and thank you everyone for joining us. We always appreciate your interest in the company and we'll speak again in three months. Have a good day.\\nOperator: 26:23 This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.\",\n",

And welcome to the Adaptive Biotechnologies First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  00:30 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Karina Calzadilla, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.\\nKarina Calzadilla: 00:40 Thank you, Alexandra, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to welcome you to Adaptive Biotechnologies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release reporting Adaptive financial results for the first quarter of 2022. 00:54 The press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the Investors section in our corporate website. 01:07 During the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. These statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today. Actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the SEC and listed in this presentation. 01:33 Joining the call today are Chad Robins, our CEO and Co-Founder; and Kyle Piskel, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Harlan Robins, Adaptive's Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder; Nitin Sood, our Head of our MRD business, and Sharon Benzeno, Head of the Immune Medicine business will be available for Q&A. 01:52 With that, I will turn the call over to Chad Robins. Chad?\\nChad Robins: 01:55 Thanks, Karina. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, I want to thank all of our Adaptive employees for their dedication and for their solid execution during a quarter in which we completed a reorganization of our business. 02:14 This strategic restructuring focuses Adaptive in two business areas: MRD and immune medicine. Along with our recent headcount reduction these changes will result in a more streamlined organization to fuel growth as we navigate this turbulent market. We continue to hire talent strategically in key growth areas, such as our clonoSEQ sales team and our Cell Therapy Group in South San Francisco. We also look forward to formally welcoming our new CFO, Tycho Peterson and leveraging his extensive expertise. Tycho will officially start on June 1st, following completion of his garden leave. 02:54 Reprioritized the product development efforts for each business area and the teams are in place to execute towards our 2022 goals. Slide three shows the respective key drivers of our MRD and immune medicine businesses. The value of our MRD business is a combination of the clonoSEQ test offer to clinicians and the clonoSEQ MRD assay offer to pharma partners, who integrate MRD status and they are hem malignancy trials. Aligning these synergistic components of the MRD business under the same leadership at Adaptive will drive execution and enhanced visibility. 03:35 The immune medicine business is comprised of pharma, clinical testing and drug discovery, all of which are driven or informed by our T-cell receptor antigen map. As with our MRD business within immune medicine there is a synergistic value between the utility of the information for clinical diagnostics and to pharma partners in research and drug development. 04:00 As shown on Slide four, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with revenue of $38.6 million. Both business areas delivered key achievements and are set up for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Within the MRD business clonoSEQ test volume experienced strong growth of 45% versus prior year. The clonoSEQ sales team of 70 reps is now fully hired and train and is being deployed to hit the field, progress continued with payers, data generation and guideline expansion. 04:37 For our MRD pharma, we continue to grow our partnerships. This quarter we entered into an expanded MRD pan-portfolio partnership with a major pharma partner in multiple myeloma and CLL for the use of MRD as a clinical endpoint.  in medicine business is also delivered on multiple fronts generating a total of approximately $21 million this quarter. 05:02 Revenue from pharma partners that use immunoSEQ and data generated from our TCR antigen map grew 100% versus prior year. We are well positioned for continued growth as we expand the use of immunoSEQ in multiple therapeutic areas and secure additional key map deals beyond COVID. For example, this quarter, we entered into a new collaboration with J&J to map T-cell responses to RSV for its vaccine program. The clinical diagnostic pipeline with the key detect is advancing in both infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. And in drug discovery, we continue to make good progress with our shared and private product programs under our Genentech collaboration. 05:49 Moving onto MRD business on Slide five. Test delivered grew 12% to 7,698 tests versus prior quarter with double-digit growth observed in all three indications. Ordering HCPs and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 53% and 36% respectively versus prior year and unique patients tested also grew 59%. Growth in the community setting although off a small base was north of 60% during the quarter, demonstrating a strong start by our expanded sales force focused on increasing our reach beyond academic centers. 06:30 In addition, about 30% of all MRD test were delivered in blood with multi-myeloma experiences the highest uptake versus prior periods. As part of our strategy to cement their leadership in lymphoid malignancies, we plan to expand into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using ctDNA, which is the best measure of relapse risk. We have submitted our application for DLBCL coverage to MolDX this quarter. We continue to enhance the overall customer experience by investing in the integration of clonoSEQ into customer ordering systems. This integration can positively impact both order volume and order pull through. We're off to a great start and on track to accelerate our growth trajectory for the remainder of the year. 07:19 I want to share on Slide six new data about using clonoSEQ and pediatric ALL patients. In this published study 143 pediatric ALL patients receiving CAR-T were tested for MRD at multiple time points using flow and clonoSEQ. Data show that clonoSEQ detected disease in blood that flow missed in marrow. Furthermore in bone marrow, the performance of clonoSEQ was very strong. clonoSEQ detected MRD in 100% of patients prior to relapse with a median lead time of 168 days versus 52 days using flow, giving the clinician significant lead time to inform treatment decisions. I look forward to sharing additional data readouts this year, further demonstrating the increasing utility of clonoSEQ MRD testing. 08:15 As mentioned before our MRD pharma partnerships are key component of our MRD business. Slide seven shows our pharma portfolio, which is comprised of partnerships with over to 60 companies that integrate clonoSEQ in their clinical trials. As efficacy of blood cancer drugs continue to improve, pharma companies are looking for more sensitive ways to measure response. Of note, our clonoSEQ MRD assay was used as a clinical endpoint in support of regulatory approval of five drugs to-date. Almost every major pharma company developing a blood cancer drug is using clonoSEQ in their trials as a clinical endpoint. 08:55 From these partnerships, we have a portfolio of more than $330 million in future eligible milestones based on additional drug approval from ongoing and future studies. We continue to grow and expand our pharma partnerships and look forward to seeing clonoSEQ data derived from these pharma trials to further drive clinical utility of the clonoSEQ test to clinicians. 09:19 Now turning to our immune medicine business on Slide eight. Immune medicine business is comprised of three growth areas: pharma; clinical testing; and drug discovery. Each of these areas has multiple shots on goal to create value in the short, medium and long-term. This value is predominantly driven by data that we generate through our TCR Antigen Map. The pharma research area, which includes over 100 companies using our immunoSEQ or T-MAP products is expected to continue to grow significantly in the short and medium term. The clinical diagnostic area or T-Detect is in the early innings with its first indication launched last year, which also served to establish T-Detect as a new class of molecular T-Cell Diagnostics. We expect T-Detect to be a more meaningful contributor to revenue in the medium to long-term, as we generate and validate T-Cell signatures in multiple autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. 10:28 And the drug discovery area, which is currently focused on our cell therapy collaboration with Genentech is in early stage of development and is expected to be a significant growth contributor in the mid to long-term. We aim to secure additional collaborations beyond cancer cell therapy that could further accelerate our growth. 10:48 Let's take a closer look on Slide nine at the immune medicine business performance this quarter. Pharma was the biggest contributor of revenue growth in the quarter and represented 30% of the immune medicine business. Our immunoSEQ T-MAP product is gaining traction with additional COVID studies and a new RSV program, which I mentioned. We expect to expand the use of existing and future T-MAPs in more disease areas as we continue to generate data from our TCR Antigen Map. As for T-Detect COVID, this quarter orders decreased versus last quarter as we are seeing the virus moved from a pandemic to an endemic state. We continue to offer the test to consumers with modest promotional activities to maintain brand awareness. 11:35 We are focusing on making T-Detect Lyme available via our CLIA lab during this Lyme season, while we accelerate data generation and signal validation and select autoimmune disorders. Drug discovery revenue is attributed to the amortization of the Genentech upfront payment, which varies quarter-over-quarter. For our shared product this year we're on track to deliver up to two additional TCR packages. We also continue to work closely with Genentech to establish the private product specifications and to build our private product data package. 12:12 Zooming into T-Detect on Slide 10. T-Detect in infectious diseases has served as a proof of our T-Detect platform further investments in COVID and Lyme indications will be pursued opportunistically. Specifically in COVID our efforts to establish the T-Cell response as a correlate of protection continue. We have been making progress at a policy level. Couple of weeks ago Adaptive alongside a group of nearly 70 leading academics industry leaders and patient advocates sent a letter to the FDA urging the incorporation of T-Cell response and COVID vaccine studies. This could further drive opportunities for T-Detect and for T-MAP COVID. We also expect to make T-Detect Lyme available in the next quarter. Data from our ImmuneSense Lyme study shows T-Detect sensitivity of 54% nearly double that of standard-of-care serology at 30%, when we hold specificity at 99% for both. 13:15 We anticipate the sensitivity to increase as we identify additional line Lyme specific TCRs from new datasets, that we will use to update our diagnostic classifier. By making T-Detect available in our CLIA lab, we aim to implement the processes, which will be necessary for all future indications. In parallel, the team is working on initiating a clinical validation study in IBD and continues to improve our signal in MS. Our objective is to launch at least one autoimmune indication set by the end of 2023. We're excited about multiple opportunities stemming from our immune medicine business. 13:57 I'll now pass it over to Kyle Piskel for our financial update. Kyle?\\nKyle Piskel: 14:01 Thanks, Chad. Turning to our financial results on Slide 11. Total revenue in the first quarter was $38.6 million, representing a slight increase from $38.4 million in the same period last year. In prior periods, we've disaggregated revenue in the sequencing and development category as you can see on the left side of the slide. This quarter our revenue reporting is now disaggregated to reflect the reorganization of our business around our MRD and immune medicine market opportunities. 14:31 Immune medicine consist of revenue generated from immunoSEQ and immunoSEQ T-MAP to pharma and research customers. Our T-Detect COVID test clinical customers and our collaboration agreements in drug discovery. MRD consist of revenue generated from clonoSEQ to clinical customers and our MRD services to pharma and research partners. We have included a revenue bridge for the last eight quarters in our earnings release and 10-Q to reflect the revised revenue disaggregation. 14:58 Our revenue mix for the first quarter consisted of 54% for immune medicines, 46% from MRD. Immune medicine revenue in the first quarter was $20.8 million, a 4% increase from the same period in 2021. Growth in immune medicine was primarily driven by $3.4 million increase in revenue from our pharma and research partners, partially offset by a $3.3 million reduction in the amortization of our Genentech upfront payment. 15:25 As a reminder, these revenue amortization amounts may vary quarter-over-quarter. MRD revenue was $17.8 million in the first quarter, down 3% from the same period last year. This change was primarily due to recognizing $7 million in regulatory milestones in Q1 of 2021 versus $3 million this quarter. This reduction was partially offset by $3.6 million increase in revenue from clonoSEQ clinical testing. clonoSEQ test funds also increased by 45% versus prior year. 15:59 Shifting now to our operating cost and guidance on Slide 12. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $101.7 million, representing a 28% increase of $79.7 million in the same quarter last year. Cost of revenue was $13.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year, representing a 32% increase. Higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in material cost, due to revenue simple volume growth and an increase in labor, overhead  16:35 Research and development expenses for the first quarter of ’22 were $37.8 million, compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter 2021, representing a 12% increase. This increase was mainly attributable to increased personnel costs, including expenses related to our restructuring activities. 16:54 Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $26.1 million, compared to $20.6 million of the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 27%. This growth was largely due to increased personnel costs, primarily due to the expansion of our clonoSEQ sales team and related customer operations teams, as well as increased travel and customer event-related expenses. One-time charges from our restructuring efforts contributed to the growth in expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses, due to reduced corporate marketing efforts. 17:28 General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022, were $24.1 million, compared to $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 62%. The increase was primarily driven by expanding our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses. Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $62.8 million, compared to the first quarter of 2021 net loss of $40.6 million. 17:55 With respect to our full-year guidance we’re reiterating our revenue range of $185 million to $195 million, which already contemplated the MRT milestone we recognized this quarter. Both our MRD and immune medicine businesses are off to a great start and we expect them to contribute to our full-year revenue, approximately 50-50 at the midpoint of the range.  it’s early in the year, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full-year commercial and  18:23 Regarding our operating expenses, we are on track for operating expenses to grow at lower rates than revenue as a result of our restructuring activities and as we continue to prudently manage our investments and improve our operating efficiency. We are being thoughtful about our cash and expect to deploy capital off our balance sheet to support those projects with the greatest potential, while also reducing our burn rate. We look forward to providing you further updates next quarter. 18:50 I'll now turn the call back to Chad.\\nChad Robins: 18:52 Thanks, Kyle. As outlined on the call and listed on Slide 13, we execute on key strategic decisions around the restructuring of our business and are on track to achieve important milestones during the rest of the year in both MRD and immune medicine. Our capital position is strong and we continue to manage our investments to fuel growth across the businesses. We're looking forward to a great 2022. 19:20 So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and open it up for questions.\\nOperator: 19:25 Thank you, sir.  And we your first question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is open.\\nBrian Weinstein: 19:42 Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question.\\nChad Robins: 19:46 Sure, Brian. Thank you.\\nBrian Weinstein: 19:47 Hey, I just wanted to go through the growth rate here a little bit, because I know there is some moving parts here, it seems like in the quarter, because you posted basically flattish growth, but Kyle or Chad, can you guys just go through some of the factors that kind of drove that flattish growth, I heard some Genentech stuff that was in there? And in some other things that might have sort of impacted that growth rate on a one-time basis. I just want to make sure that we understand what those things were?\\nKyle Piskel: 20:17 Sure, I'll take that, Brian. I’d, kind of, first like to start with the two main components that drive a bit of quarter-to-quarter comparative challenges. The first thing the MRD milestones and just as a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had approximately $7 million of milestones from our MRD business and this quarter we have $3 million, so we’re seeing $4 million in compression there from a comp perspective. 20:43 The second component is the Genentech amortization and comparing that to last quarter -- last year we had about $16 million versus this quarter where we're about $12 million. So those two things kind of really compress the growth. And if you back those out you’d see about 47% year-over-year growth. So that's kind of driving some of that uptick.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:05 And when we think about the Genentech amortization, it’s always somewhat of a black box for us I think how we should we be thinking about that going forward, I mean just so that we're level set here so that we can turn it back that stuff out in -- with a little bit more visibility. It's always our somewhat confusing for us?\\nKyle Piskel: 21:25 Yes, I'd say for the -- it's tied to our expense investment in the Genentech collaboration, I'd say for the remainder of the full-year, we're still on track to be about the same total revenues last year, maybe a little bit of a bell curve this year for Q2 and Q3 and that come back down a little bit to Q4. But overall, I'd say it will be fairly consistent to last year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:49 Got it and then Chad for you, obviously the markets are very focused on pushes towards profitability, cash flow breakeven. I don't think you guys will give you kind of formal talks about that, but I'd love to kind of have some sort of past that you guys are thinking about towards profitability, the steps that you guys think that you'll need to take and any thoughts on timing there?\\nChad Robins: 22:15 Yes, so first I'll just acknowledge that the path to profitability and at least cash flow neutrality is incredibly important for us for Adaptive and we -- I think we got out ahead of it earlier -- early this year and took proactive steps with doing the restructuring and the reduction in force. We continue to look at ways to manage expenses and at the same time, look, we're looking at opportunities to bring in what I'll call non-dilutive cash flow through different partnership and financing mechanisms, look, let's face it, the cost of capital is high right now and we are -- on a past to do what we can. So we don't have to take in capital that will be dilutive to the company in this economic environment. 23:03 That's a two, where Tycho coming on board, we were really sharpening that long-range plan and should have better visibility into that time horizon to get you, kind of, cash flow profitability and should be providing that for you within the back half of the year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 23:23 Okay, thanks guys.\\nChad Robins: 23:25 Sure. Thanks, Brent.\\nOperator: 23:28 We have your next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\nElizabeth Webster: 23:33 Hey guys, this is Elizabeth on for Salveen, thanks for taking my question. Just on the Genentech, maybe if you could kind of walk us through what might be needed for the private product specification? And what you kind of aim to deliver this year, and just maybe remind us what goes into those data packages? Thank you.\\nChad Robins: 23:57 Sure, I'm going to have Sharon Benzeno, who is Head of our Immune Medicine business, take the call the Sharon.\\nSharon Benzeno: 24:01 Yes, thanks, Elizabeth. So, as we previously stated, and on the heels of our successful proof-of-concept screens using a blood from 60 cancer patients last year that was the first pass defining certain specifications that we're carrying through this year and expanding that in an additional set of 30 or more cancer patients as well. And so the goal there is, importantly running the end-to-end workflow on our end in our dedicated South San Francisco lab end-to-end. And in parallel, in conjunction with the pieces of the puzzle that Genentech is putting together, the process being the product. So that’s what we're aiming this year building off of the success from last year.\\nElizabeth Webster: 24:54 Got it. I thank you, that's helpful.\\nOperator: 25:00 We have your next question is from Mark Massaro with BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMark Massaro: 25:07 Hey guys, thanks for the questions. If I can, I'll ask to all at once, I guess first nice growth from clonoSEQ this quarter. Can you just comment on your visibility of what you're seeing in the field? Are you guys fully open nearly to pre-pandemic levels? And maybe just comment about what kind of access you have reps in the field versus virtual? And then the second question is on Slide 17, you show, you've got Crohn's and MS and Celiac kind of in the lead for your autoimmune diseases, should we think of those as like the lead candidates, I guess what my question really boils down to is to what extent are you committed to advancing and investing in RA, obviously Crohn's and Colitis are linked, so can you just help us think about the priorities of the autoimmune disease portfolio?\\nKyle Piskel: 26:04 Sure. Hi, Mark. I'm going to have Nitin Sood, who is Head of our MRD business, take the first question. And then with regards to prioritization, Harlan will take that, so Nitin.\\nNitin Sood: 26:15 Hey, Mark. Yes, so we're seeing an improvement in in-person meetings it's trending in a positive direction. But I would say today is still about 60% of our visits are virtual, but on our day-to-day basis  basis, we see a positive trend, and I expect us to be sort of 50% very shortly in terms of in- person visits.\\nMark Massaro: 26:48 Okay and then just on the priority of the autoimmune disease portfolio?\\nHarlan Robins: 26:54 Sure, thanks. This is Harlan, so we're focusing our resources where our signals are most advanced and we have the highest quality samples for early diagnosis of disease. And of course having a high unmet need, we prioritized MS and Crohn's higher than RA simply, because we have -- we're a little bit farther behind in collecting RA samples, not for any other particular reason. And the key -- the real key that we're focusing on is our -- as our differentiator is specificity here. So just as reference we're aiming to really reduce the number of false positives. So that we can hit an earlier diagnostic market and so that's really been the focus, and that's where we've had the biggest increase in our signals as we go. And we're going to take the learnings from this and apply it into other diseases as we create panels. And in particular for IBD as we’re going to initiate sample collection for clinical validation study into the coming months.\\nMark Massaro: 28:13 Great, thank you.\\nOperator: 28:16 We have your next question from the Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Excuse me, Derik your line is open, you may ask your question.\\nChad Robins: 28:44 Let's go onto the next question.\\nOperator: 28:47 We have your next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 28:53 Hello, this is  from --  on the call for Tejas. Thank you for taking our questions. Would you elaborate on the plans to reduce the work for us, or the reduction mostly and administrative overhead R&D or commercial, what projects do you deprioritize and should we anticipate any delays in key timelines as it relates to clonoSEQ inflection, expansion into DLBCL, any color around that would be great.\\nChad Robins: 29:27 Yes, sure. Hey  I'll take that. So first, we -- there was many areas affected across the business, but it wasn't uniformly distributed, for example, there were very, very few cuts in the MRD business. So to your questions about kind of DLBCL, or any of that kind of project development pipeline is, is all on track. In addition, the -- that's kind of the cell therapy group in San Francisco had very little cut, so there were cuts across going to general and administration, project management and frankly some it's duplicate of our stack hiring as well that we had an opportunity, frankly where we thought we could gain some efficiencies and leverage in the existing business. So we are moving forward and as Harlan said we're being very, very, very clinical if you will to -- these upon here on how we're prioritizing the T-Detect program and we're also being very opportunistic about continued investments for example in COVID given that's taking more of an endemic state and we've seen some of the T-Detect orders, kind of, wane as COVID kind of becomes more normalized in the population. So hopefully that's helpful color to you in terms of kind of how we looked at the reduction in force and prioritization.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 31:05 Got it. No, that's super helpful. And then on the product development expansion efforts into NHL, could you walk us through the rationale for using cell-free DNA. Is there a specific advantage using cell-free DNA in NHL versus some of the other indications? And could this be a strategy that you would like to deploy on a go-forward basis?\\nNitin Sood: 31:28 Yes, so I'll ask answer that question, this is Nitin. Specifically for DLBCL there have been studies that have been published that demonstrate that cell-free DNA is a better handle light, but for other diseases, namely CLL, ALL and multiple myeloma, our cellular assay, does really well. So on an ongoing basis, I don't expect any changes on those three indications. But for not much as lymphoma and more specifically for DLBCL, we're going with the analytes know has the best performance. 32:10 And longer-term on -- we will also look at potentially combining both the analytes namely the cell-free DNA analyte and the cellular assay. Obviously, we're the one company that can do both. So, we potentially look at combining both at the analytes.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 32:30 Great, thank you so much for that color.\\nOperator: 32:34 We have your next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nDerik de Bruin: 32:40 Hi, sorry about that my phone dropped earlier. Hey, can you give us some color on the ASPs for clonoSEQ. I mean, you didn't break out the clinical sequencing revenues, I'd like historically. So can you give us some idea on coverage on just the ASP and just give us, bit more clarity?\\nNitin Sood: 33:00 Yes. So I think this is Nitin again, we've seen steady ASP growth for clonoSEQ or the past couple of years and we're anticipating that the growth will continue in the mid single-digit range over the next two to three years. We're very close to about $1,000 in ASP today and our expectation is in two to three years, we're in the $1,200 to $1,300 range for ASP.\\nDerik de Bruin: 33:26 Got it. And I know this was asked earlier, but just want to go back and revisit it. I mean, do you expect, I mean, the cash burn was quite a bit higher in the first quarter, do you expect that to ramp down throughout the rest of the year? Basically, as the question on, do you have enough cash this year?\\nKyle Piskel: 33:42 Yes, this is Kyle. Yes, so a couple of things in Q1, obviously you don't have the full effect of our restructuring efforts in the cash burn, because of the timing of when we initiated that was late March. The second thing as it relates to Q1 is a bit of seasonality, we have our corporate bonus payouts in Q1. So from a cash perspective, I'm generally thinking of the rest of the three quarters was between $50 million and $60 million is cash flow.\\nDerik de Bruin: 34:10 Great, thank you. That's helpful. And I guess any -- and I'm sorry and did you talk about when you expect to see the NHL assay to be commercialized. I know you're in validation and clear validation now?\\nChad Robins: 34:27 Yes, with respect to NHL, we're going to launch that later this year in our CLIA environment, we have submitted our tech assessment to MolDX and are waiting to hear back on reimbursement, but as with many of our diagnostics and assays will launch ahead of reimbursement towards, kind of, the back half of the year. I mean it is currently available in our CLIA environment and with the cellular assay, but we've got as mentioned earlier, we've got product development efforts ongoing to convert that to incorporate ctDNA into the assay, as well for -- to enhance the product.\\nDerik de Bruin: 35:10 Great, thank you.\\nKyle Piskel: 35:11 I’d would just add one more item to that, as you know before ahead of that launch will be doing what we call a Clinical Experience Program with 30 physicians, so that's already underway and we're pretty confident, that by October, November of this year, we'll have a full commercial launch with strict use and ctDNA assay by October of this year.\\nDerik de Bruin: 35:39 Thanks.\\nOperator: 35:42 I'm showing no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.\\nChad Robins: 35:54 Thank you.\",\n",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions and comments after the presentation. 0:24 It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Kathy Liebmann. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\\nKathy Liebmann: 0:32 Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. With us this morning are Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Lucian, CFO. Melinda will open and close the call, and Bob will speak to segment performance and the financials midway through. We’ll then open the call to questions. Slides will accompany this presentation and you may view them through our webcast link, which will be available for one year, and a telephone replay of the call will be available for one week beginning this afternoon. 1:10 Before we begin the presentation, I’d like to remind you that some statements made in today’s call include forward-looking statements about La-Z-Boy’s future performance and other matters. Although we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially. The most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to review those risk factors, as well as other key information detailed in our SEC filings. 1:44 Also, our earnings release is available under the News and Events tab on the Investor Relations page of our website, and it includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures which are also included as an appendix at the end of our conference call slide deck. 2:00 With that, I’d now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Melinda?\\nMelinda Whittington: 2:09 Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon following the close of market, we reported our fiscal ’22 third quarter results, which included delivered consolidated sales of a strong 22% versus last Q3, including record delivered sales and operating profit for our company owned retail segment. Ongoing strong demand versus pre-pandemic levels $32 million, returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total up to $96 million and all time high and closing on 2 important acquisitions to five La-Z-Boy furniture gallery stores in the Alabama market and the Furnico (ph) Manufacturing Company in the UK. 2:59 While delivering strong top line growth, the quarter also had significant challenges. After a very strong November across the majority of our business, supply chain volatility amplified in the balance of the quarter, even beyond our previous expectations. This had a significant near-term impact on the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity ramp plans, affecting both sales and profit performance 3:27 Within our own manufacturing operations, which comprise the majority of our wholesale business, lack of availability of component parts, including electronic chips and actuators, continued to disrupt production plans but at a higher level than we expected. Beyond the obvious direct production delays, these outages drove inefficiencies as manufacturing cells are trained on specific unit styles and need to retrain on other styles until parts are available. This was exacerbated by such a large portion of our manufacturing staff being relatively new, given our significant capacity expansion, including 3 new facilities in Mexico over the past year. 4:11 Further, these parts outages are disproportionately affecting our higher end products, which sell at a greater level in our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, including our own retail, thereby magnifying the near-term financial impact. 4:29 With the goal of meeting consumer demand and to best serve our customers in this environment, our procurement team continues to invest in inventory for key component parts and diversify our supplier base, including creative solutions. In one particular instance, we have sent a La-Z-Boy team to work in the plant of one of our domestic suppliers to help increase their production of component parts for La-Z-Boy, as they too are experiencing labor challenges. We will continue to make progress here. The global supply chain disruptions remain prevalent and we will likely be managing them for a while. 5:10 Additionally, the 14-week COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam, where the majority of our casegoods product is sourced significantly impacted our wholesale segment resulting from minimal inventory available to ship to consumers and high freight costs during the quarter. Product is flowing again, and we expect casegoods sales and profits to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 when we were more consistently received product to ship to customers. 5:43 Further exacerbating the disruption this quarter, the Omicron variant impacted plant operations and production across all geographies. In January, at times we had as much as 20% of our manufacturing workforce out, due to contraction of the virus or exposure. As the health and safety of our team remains our highest priority. These peaks are orders of magnitude higher than our previous worst peaks last winter. As with much of North America, we're now seeing the number of COVID cases trend downward quickly, but it will take time to recover from the disruption. 6:24 Managing across these challenges, as well as the ongoing tight labor market and increasing input costs, has resulted in production gains being slower than expected, impacting the pace of delivered sales and profitability growth in the near term. Our number one focus across the company is to improve the agility of our supply chain to increase production more quickly and efficiently. We have deployed SWAT teams comprised of some of our most experienced leaders to our newer, most challenged locations to assist in training and increasing output. We have hired additional key leadership with expertise from other industries to bring fresh perspectives to our challenges, working alongside our industry veterans. And as noted, we continue to identify and act on creative solutions to upstream supply challenges, including expanded sourcing diversity, protective inventory builds and even helping suppliers staff extra shifts to supply key component parts 7:33 These challenges while significant, are temporary in nature and each day we get better at managing through them. Ultimately, demand for our product is strong and we are already delivering sales at all-time record levels. But we must do better to weather each disruption, continue to increase our capacity, improve cost efficiencies, work down our backlog, and service our customers and consumers. While working toward the double digit profitability levels, we know we can achieve in the longer-term with our expanded North American footprint. 8:14 Turning back to the top line and demand for our products, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries Network increased 3% in the fiscal ’22 third quarter and we are at 9% compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 quarter for a compound annual growth rate of 4% across the 2 years. Sales to the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network represent about half of our total manufactured La-Z-Boy products and are directionally indicative of the continued strength of demand for our product over time. 8:52 For our company own stores, our retail segment written same-store sales were down 1% versus the prior year third quarter and up across the two years at a compound annual growth rate of 4%. Given the unusual nature of the past 2 years, written same-store sales comparisons in any given period may shift positive or negative slightly compared with prior year period, even as the underlying business remains very strong. In fact, our annual sales per store across the network now average about $5 million versus $4 million pre-pandemic. 9:35 And as part of our Century Vision, in addition to sustained strong same-store sales, we intend to also grow La-Z-Boy with additional new stores and specific to our company on retail business, opportunistic company acquisitions of existing independently owned stores such as the recent Alabama network acquisition. 10:02 And our Joybird business continues on its strong growth trajectory this quarter, writing 27% more business this Q3 than last year's third quarter with an extremely impressive compound annual growth rate of 51% across the last 2 years. 10:22 Now let me turn the call over to Bob to review the results in more detail, Bob.\\nBob Lucian: 10:27 Thank you, Melinda and good morning everyone. As a reminder, we present our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We believe a non-GAAP presentation better reflects the underlying operating trends and performance of the business. Non GAAP results exclude items which are detailed in our press release and in the tables in the appendix section of our conference call slides. 10:51 On a consolidated basis, fiscal ’22 third quarter sales increased 22% to $572 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting continued strong demand and ongoing manufacturing capacity increases as well as the effects of pricing and surcharge actions. Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter sales were 20% higher for a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the last 2 years. 11:21 Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $39 million versus the prior year period. And non-GAAP operating income was $40 million. Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.9% and non-GAAP operating margin was 7.0%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 for the fiscal ’22 third quarter versus $0.62 and the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 in the current year quarter versus $0.74 and last year's third quarter. 11:52 As I moved to the segment discussion, my comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise. Demand for and delivery of product across the enterprise remains strong. Starting with our wholesale segment delivered sales for the quarter grew 21% to $423 million compared with the prior year period, driven by pricing and surcharge actions as well as higher volume. 12:21 Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 6.5% versus 10.2% and last year’s third quarter. This reflects higher raw material and freight costs sourcing related tariff and duty increases in disruption from component parts shortages. We also experienced continued labor challenges and planet inefficiencies related to manufacturing startup activities, which are exacerbated by the latest COVID peaks. Additionally, COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam significantly impacted the product flow and margin performance of our casegoods business. Driving an approximate 130 basis point decline and non-GAAP operating margin of the total 370 basis point declined for the period. These challenges were partially offset by pricing and surcharges. Fixed Costs leverage on higher volume and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales. 13:16 For the quarter, our retail segment delivered sales increased 19% to an all-time record $197 million, delivered same-store sales increase 16% versus the year ago quarter. Retail posted record high non-GAAP operating profit dollars and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 12.2% versus 8.9% in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by fixed costs leverage on the higher delivered sales volume in discipline expense management. Joybird, which is reported in corporate and other posted record sales of $45 million, a 56% increase versus the prior year quarter. On a two-year basis, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter deliver sales more than doubled, representing a compound annual growth rate of 43%. This reflects the Momentum Joybird is building in the direct to consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels. 14:23 Joybird’s profit for the quarter was roughly breakeven as we invested significantly in marketing to grow the business while experiencing increased raw material and freight costs which negatively impacted gross margin. Moving forward we expect pricing actions to continue to work their way through our delivered sales, which will improve gross margin back to target levels. And we will continue to invest in marketing to deliver disproportionate brand growth while sustaining profitability. 14:52 Putting all of this together, consolidated non GAAP gross margin for the entire company for fiscal ’22 third quarter decreased 440 basis points versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to the challenges noted in wholesale offset partially by pricing and surcharge actions. 15:10 Consolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased 190 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed costs leverage on a higher sales volume across our wholesale and retail segments. Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal ’22 third quarter was 24.8% versus 27.7% and last year's third quarter. The third quarter of last year was unfavorably impacted by a non-deductible fair value adjustment of the contingent liability related to the acquisition of our Joybird business. Our effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to state taxes. We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal ’22 year to be to be between 25.5% and 26.5%. 16:02 Turning to cash year-to-date, we generated $45 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the period with $240 million in cash and no debt and held $30 million in investments to enhance returns on cash. Year-to-date, we've invested $83 million in higher inventory levels to help protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production and delivered sales. We have also spent $59 million in capital year-to-date primarily related to improve in store – retail stores. New upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico, plant upgrades at our manufacturing and distribution facilities and technology upgrades. 16:45 Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter, we continue to buy back shares, spending $25 million repurchasing more than 700,000 shares of stock in the open market, leaving 7.9 million shares in our existing authorized share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have returned $76 million to shareholders via share repurchase and $21 million through dividends including $70 million paid in dividends in the third quarter. 17:16 Before turning the call back to Melinda, let me highlight several important items for the remainder of fiscal ’22. As noted, demand trends are strong across the business and remain much higher than pre-COVID levels, and our backlog remains high. To address this strong demand, we will continue to improve our agility and ability to increase production capacity, although our near-term gains will be slower than previously anticipated. Efficient plant expansion will also benefit when global supply chain disruptions begin to stabilize although this timing is unknown, and these challenges will likely continue to disproportionately impact our higher end products, which sell a greater level and our La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Stores. 18:02 Specifically the casegoods import business, we expect operations to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 as we more consistently receive product and ship it to our customers. The fourth quarter will benefit by containing 14 production weeks compared to 12 production weeks in our third quarter. To recall fiscal ’22 will include 53 weeks of results versus 52 weeks last year. 18:29 Taking all of these factors into consideration, we now expect delivered sales per week in Q4 to be flat to slightly up versus the third quarter and consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to strengthen to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. We maintain our long-term commitment to steady margin progress, as we deliver incremental capacity increases with our rebalanced North America manufacturing footprint and improve our ability to adjust the supply chain disruptions. 19:00 This will enable us to better service the demand for our highest value products, which disproportionately sell through our furniture gallery stores. However, as noted, many variables will affect the next several quarters progress against these goals. 19:15 Finally, as we make investments in the business to strengthen the company for the future, including work related to our Century Vision strategy. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for fiscal ’22. 19:29 And now I will turn the call back to Melinda.\\nMelinda Whittington: 19:33 Thanks, Bob. While near term supply chain headwinds are impacting our ability to efficiently ramp production to the extent we would like near term. Demand for our products is strong. Delivered sales are at all-time highs. We believe the momentum is sustainable. And we are poised to grow from this new base of nearly $2.2 billion of trailing 12 months sales. In the immediate term, we are laser focused on driving efficient supply chain expansion to benefit our end consumers, our customer business partners, and our top and bottom line financial performance. 20:16 And looking further out, our focus remains on long-term profitable growth as we execute our Century Vision, our strategy to leverage our strong consumer brands to drive sales growth ahead of the industry and deliver double digit non-GAAP operating margins and value to all stakeholders. 20:39 We thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call back to Kathy.\\nKathy Liebmann: 20:44 Thank you Melinda. We will begin Q&A period. Now Holly, please review the instructions for getting in the queue to ask a question.\\nOperator: 20:54 Certainly, [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bobby Griffin. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.\\nBobby Griffin: 21:26 Good morning, buddy. This is Bobby Griffin from Raymond James. Thanks for taking my questions and hope everybody's doing well.\\nMelinda Whittington: 21:33 Good morning, Bobby.\\nBob Lucian: 21:33 Good morning.\\nBobby Griffin: 21:36 I guess, first, I want to just touch on the price increases and maybe help us connect where we are on the pricing that you've passed through and how much has been realized? And I guess how much is still left to be realized as you move forward?\\nBob Lucian: 21:54 Value the vast majority of the pricing is now coming through delivered sales for the La-Z-Boy brand. We've got a little bit more pricing on both the casegoods side and the Joybird side, that will come through Q4 and a little bit into Q1, just giving some of the increases that we've seen in freight, and what we import out of Vietnam.\\nBobby Griffin: 22:16 Okay. So Bob, is the – is the cost pressures that we're seeing in supply chain wise is more in efficiencies and just having to expedite things and challenges that way versus, just pure cost of items, or you're going to have to take based on some of these more recent challenges you caught out, you're gonna have to take more pricing to get whole again, as well.\\nBob Lucian: 22:36 It's more of a, it's more of a former of what you talked about relative to some of the inefficiencies that we have in our operations and the hits that we're taking as it relates to supply chain disruptions, and the extra work and money and effort we have to spend to deal with that.\\nBobby Griffin: 22:50 Okay.\\nMelinda Whittington: 22:51 Now, that said, we're constantly watching input costs, and we'll continue to price as needed as we go forward.\\nBobby Griffin: 23:00 Okay, that makes sense. And then, I guess, secondly for me -- and that's helpful. I appreciate the detail on the last one. Secondly for me, I know we typically want to get the backlog once a year in the 10-K, but times are a little more unique now and given the size of the backlog. I was hoping maybe just to get a little color on directionally where it's at. Written trends have been positive year-to-date, production has increased. But it's tough to kind of say, has the backlog actually materially come down given that business has been pretty good so far, even with increased production?\\nMelinda Whittington: 23:34 Yeah, the backlog is about the same, honestly. And, we exactly, as you said, it's a – it's a equation of strength of demand and our ramping capacity. And, truthfully, we want to see that backlog start to come down, because that's how we better service our customers and our consumers. But right now, we're at about the same place. And again, it's an equation of strong demand continued, and capacity ramping, but not fast enough to shorten our lead times.\\nBobby Griffin: 24:09 Okay, That’s helpful. And then I guess, lastly for me, we have gotten a couple of questions. When you look at the written same-store sales for the owned and licensed stores, sort of the whole La-Z-Boy network. On a two year basis, they did slow sequentially and now, I guess my question is, I understand timing wise, the price increases and stuff last year can mess with the seasonality. So if you put written into, I guess, if you take and look at just dollars of written business, as is that materially changed from 1Q to 2Q to 3Q, is there anything to read more into that slowdown on a two-year percentage basis?\\nMelinda Whittington: 24:44 I think the thing to keep in mind overall is that the business is about 30% bigger than it was pre-pandemic, and it's sustaining. And, as we think about growth across that demand continues high to your point on any given quarter that the base period comparisons get so strange on, this December, January was more affected by Omicron. And Canada, they were shut down a year ago, for the most part, you get a lot of different wiggles at any given period. But overall, the written trends still stay strong, and our businesses is 30% bigger than it was before the pandemic. So our focus is on continuing to grow that, obviously, we want to keep kind of that same-store sales, written business strong. I mentioned in my prepared comments that right now, our average is about $5 million per store on existing stores. And before the pandemic, it was $4 million. But at the same time, we'll look to expand stores and expand the number of stores we own as well. And of course, that's just speaking to our retail business, half of our business is selling through other outlets, other customers and that business remains strong as well.\\nBobby Griffin: 26:07 Okay, that's very helpful. I'll jump back – jump back in the queue and turn it over somebody else. Thank you for taking my questions. And best of luck, you're going forward.\\nMelinda Whittington: 26:15 Thanks, Bobby.\\nBob Lucian : 26:16 Thank you.\\nOperator: 26:18 Your next question is coming from Anthony Lebiedzinski. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 26:27 Oh, yes. Good morning. This is Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti and company and good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So looking at the guidance for operating margin for Q4, what are the biggest factors as far as driving that sequential increase that you expect?\\nBob Lucian: 26:48 The biggest factors are continuing to make progress against increasing our capacity, getting the hire – continuing to hire and train and retain the folks that we need for that capacity, as well as opportunities that we have to improve our mix with better, I should say slightly improving parts outages on some of the higher cost products that we make and sell through our retail outlets. So those are the key factors that we expect, that will help us to drive it sequentially higher margin versus what we just delivered.\\nMelinda Whittington: 27:24 And those are really Anthony, the same – the same factors we've been looking at all along, we're marching towards stronger capacity and more efficient capacity builds. Unfortunately, this quarter, we had more setbacks than we expected on that trajectory. And it's going to recognize and it's going to take time, but it's really all about driving that capacity, servicing the consumer and getting more efficient as we go.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 27:57 Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the component shortages that you spoke about, so since the quarter ended last month, but has there been any notable change? Or is it just kind of more of the same?\\nBob Lucian: 28:09 There has been – there's been incremental sequential improvement, it's not fixed. I mean, we're some of the work that we're doing with some of our suppliers, and some of the extra suppliers that we're bringing online, are starting to have a more positive impact relative to their shortages. But it's not a just flip a switch, turn it on, and always problems go away. So that will just continue to improve as we move through the quarter and into the first half of next year.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 28:40 That's okay, so that's encouraging to hear. And the last question for me, so Joybird again, did very well. Now accounting for 8% of total sales for the quarter, longer-term hub, how should we think about the growth of that business as to how big it could ultimately become and as that happens? How should we think about profitability of that segment? Longer-term?\\nMelinda Whittington: 29:03 Yeah, we have, as we've laid out our Century Vision, we obviously a huge building block of that Century Vision for growth over time, we've said as a total company, we believe we can grow ahead of the industry. One pillar that is the La-Z-Boy brand, and really reinvigorating that brand. A second pillar is really leveraging the opportunity that the room that we believe we have for Joybird to grow as a consumer brand, so we will continue to invest in that brand. And we do believe it will disproportionately grow within our business and our focus is on maintaining a reasonable profitability with that business, but not necessarily expecting it to look like, an integrated profit on our La-Z-Boy brand, because it is in growth mode. So in different modes of its – of its maturity.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 30:00 Understood. Okay. Thank you very much and best of luck going forward.\\nMelinda Whittington: 30:05 Thanks, Anthony.\\nOperator: 30:09 [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Brad Thomas, please announce your affiliation. Then pose your question.\\nBradley Thomas: 30:24 Hi, good morning. Yes, it’s Brad Thomas with Keybanc Capital Markets. Good morning, Melinda, Bob and Kathy.\\nBob Lucian: 30:30 Hi, Brad.\\nMelinda Whittington: 30:31 Good morning.\\nBradley Thomas: 30:34 All right, just a few more for me here along probably similar vein as some of the earlier questions. But maybe just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the written orders and wondering if you could provide any color on, how things trended through the quarter what you're seeing thus far. In February, we've obviously heard broader concerns about Omicron weather, and lapping stimulus payments as having been headwinds for the consumer of late. Just curious if you're seeing any of that in your business.\\nMelinda Whittington: 31:08 Yes. I can't say there's any dramatic trend change through the quarter other than, as I noted, we saw January hit by Omicron temporarily, right? That was fairly fast. If you think about, again, from a comparison standpoint, Canada was essentially shut down last year. Now they're open. So on a comparison basis, Canada looks great. But from a more long-term trend, I don't think we're seeing any dramatic change per se.\\nBradley Thomas: 31:47 That's helpful. And so with what you're seeing today, you feel like your fiscal fourth quarter is tracking up so far on a written basis, is that right?\\nMelinda Whittington: 31:59 Yes. I guess I would – I'm not going to comment on written for fourth quarter right now as there are so many different moving pieces, including in the base. But I would just point out a couple of things as we think – I think written same-store sales is an important metric to kind of look at what are you doing with an existing asset base over time. 32:26 But I would also challenge that it's maybe – it certainly isn't the only metric to look at any of these businesses right now when the base period is so different than what it has been in the past. So today, our stores are averaging $5 million in delivered sales per year compared to 2 years ago pre-COVID, they were $4 million a year, right? So what the – what we are growing off of that base, what we are achieving off of that base of any given store is 30% more than it had been. 33:07 As we go forward, we'll continue to look at how do you drive more off of that same base of stores, for sure, that same written same-store sale number. But what we're also looking at is part of Century Vision, expanding the number of stores. And we've talked in the past around – we believe there's opportunity for, call it, about 50 additional stores just with an existing space where the marketplace would support additional stores. We'll continue to also grow through acquisition like we did at the Alabama stores here in the last couple of months through, as we have in the past on some of the independently owned. And then, of course, through our other businesses as well. 33:54 So written same-store sales is an important metric, and we believe it will continue to be directionally positive over time, but it's not the only metric by which to evaluate the growth of our business as we go forward, or anyone's business, I would say, coming off of this unusual pandemic time.\\nBradley Thomas: 34:15 Got you. That's helpful context. Thank you. And then I guess just as we think some of the product inability or longer-than-usual times that you're quoting and some of the mix dynamics, I guess just as we're thinking about on whatever basis you want to talk about, delivered sales and reported sales or written sales, is there any way that you think that sales of any sort are being impacted right now by what your offering is like? And if so, any ability to quantify it? Again, I'm just trying to put context around it. Some of the stuff.\\nMelinda Whittington: 34:52 Sure, absolutely. So from – a couple of things. Right now, we're quoting 4 to 6 months lead time, and that is not where we would be. That's on our La-Z-Boy business. We're shorter on our Joybird business right now. That's not good service to our customers or our consumers, right? 35:10 And so it all sort of comes down to our whole focus is on getting that supply chain expansion up running and running as efficiently as our plants have run over time. That's got to happen. As we do that, just simply with what's in our backlog, our backlog is still at all-time highs on our La-Z-Boy business. So just with what's in our backlog alone, we will continue to drive increased delivered sales and improve profitability quarter-on-quarter. 35:47 And we've got a runway again, just with the orders that are already on the books to drive delivered sales incrementally improving week after week. This quarter, a little bit slower than what we had hoped, but we will continue to work through that and through as Bob noted, for quarters to come, we expect to see incremental improvement in capacity. And given even just the orders on the books, that turns into delivered sales right away. 36:16 At the same time, as we're looking at how do you keep filling the coffer again, right? We want to drive that backlog down because we want to be delivering better service to our customers and our consumers. But as we drive that backlog down, we want to be filling that coffer with more sales to deliver. And so with that, we will continue to drive, strengthening written sales. And we believe we can do that through the strength of our brands. And with our Century Vision, I'm really reinvigorating the brand equities as well, to ensure we're growing for the long term. 36:52 Now the exact pace of that on any given quarter may shift around a little bit, but we feel confident that our last – our trailing 12 months is about $2.2 billion in sales for total company. Pre-pandemic, we were at $1.7 billion right? So business is up 30% pre-pandemic and we do believe we will grow – we have the building blocks to grow off of that base ongoing and improve margins over time.\\nRobert Lucian: 37:25 One thing I'd add to that, just from a – how do you feel about the business. When a consumer walks in and they're paying more money for product, and we're telling them it's still going to take them 4 to 6 months to get that product and our sales -- our written sales are still strong, that's a good indication that the brand is strong and that some of the concerns that are out there, that you've written about around stimulus checks going away and other doom and gloom on the industry, we're a little bit more bullish from that standpoint, from an industry perspective, because we're able to weather the higher prices and the longer lead times. Not happy about either one of those things, but we're here to make sure that the consumers who come in want furniture, get that furniture.\\nBradley Thomas: 38:15 Absolutely. And no question the industry is facing just untested level of complexities and challenges right now and you're navigating many of those very well. Just on some of the guidance for the fourth quarter, I just want to make sure people are doing the math right here. I think if we looked at 12 weeks versus 14 weeks and on a per week basis being flat to up, that implies that sales may be up in your fiscal fourth quarter, perhaps high 20s to low 30s percent. Just with the consensus sitting here now, I think only 23% growth. I just want to make sure we're doing the math right there. Bob?\\nRobert Lucian: 38:56 The math is correct to take your Q3 divided by 12, multiply it by 14 and it will be that or slightly better than that.\\nBradley Thomas: 39:08 Perfect. And then just a last one for me about coming back to margins that are clearly a focal point here. I guess as you reflect on the third quarter and some of the guidance here for 4Q, how much do you think is kind of clear cut? Oh, this should go away if we just give it time. This is part of the transitory issues we're dealing with in the pandemic, versus issues that may be a little bit more structural. And I guess, how, if at all, is your kind of long-term outlook for operating margins for La-Z-Boy changing?\\nMelinda Whittington: 39:40 Brad, I'll talk about that in a bit, and then Bob can add in. It's a little bit of each of those. So the first thing is we've got 3 brand-new plants that we've opened in Mexico, as well as the labor challenges in the U.S. So we've got a lot of new people making furniture. And we've talked in the past about it takes 6 to 9 months to sort of get them up to average – kind of average throughput and when that many people are new, that probably slows that down a little bit. 40:14 So a healthy chunk of what we saw this quarter is we were really now with -- we just in January, opened that third brand-new plant. We are every day adding more to the sales and the production capacity. What we saw this quarter is those continued and exacerbated disruptions on parts, the different – the Omicron, outages, and so you're always putting different – in the end, it's an artesian process. So you're always putting different people together trying to make furniture. 40:44 So what we saw is we didn't get the efficiency gains that we expected to in this quarter. That doesn't mean they're not there. And so a big piece of our progress on margin and we're just trying to be realistic about you're dealing with training thousands of people, we're trying to be realistic about how quickly we come up on that. But a big chunk of that progress forward is controlling our own destiny, right? It's getting better every day at training folks to be able to be very efficient on furniture production and getting better at weathering the uncontrollables. 41:24 So there's no doubt, again, the chip shortages continue they actuate as you pick your thing, and we're investing in inventory to manage as much of that disruption as possible. But there are some things like, you can't go buy more chips, right? They just don't exist. So some of those things are real, but we have to work on our own agility to manage that. 41:47 So yes, there will continue to be disruptions. Yes, they will cause inefficiencies. But a lot of going forward is within our own control of getting better, getting our folks trained and being able to weather those things so that we continue to make progress. And at the end of this, we'll have a better distributed footprint of where our manufacturing facilities lie across all of North America that sets us up with a better overall structure, cost structure and service structure than we had pre-pandemic, even though I think some of the external headwinds will probably -- inflation and so forth, will exist for the longer-term.\\nBradley Thomas: 42:39 Very helpful. Thank you so much Melinda.\\nMelinda Whittington: 42:42 Thanks, Brad.\\nOperator: 42:48 There appear to be no further questions in queue. Do you have any closing comments you'd like to finish with?\\nKathy Liebmann: 42:55 Thanks, Holly. Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. If you have follow-up questions, please be in touch and have a great day. Bye bye.\\nOperator: 43:07 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

We have our Executive Management team here with us this morning, Dan, Paul, Chris, Valerie and Hank. Our speakers will be referring to prepared slides during the discussion. You can find the slides by going to our Investor Relations page at ir.cadencebank.com, where you'll find them on the link to our webcast or you can view them as the exhibit to the 8-K that we filed yesterday afternoon. These slides are also in the Presentation section of our Investor Relations website. 00:39 I would remind you that the presentation, along with our earnings release contain our customary disclosures around forward-looking statements and any non-GAAP metrics that may be discussed this morning. 00:50 And now I'll turn to Dan Rollins for his opening comments.\\nDan Rollins: 00:55 Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cadence Bank's first quarter 2022 financial results. Paul and I will cover a few highlights this morning, as well as provide an update on our integration efforts. Valerie will discuss the financial results in more detail. Chris and Hank will provide some additional color on our frontline efforts. And after we conclude our prepared comments, our Executive Management team will be happy to answer questions. 01:19 It is an interesting time in our industry, given the economic trends, including the rate environment and inflationary pressures, as well as the political instability overseas. We are frequently asked questions about how these dynamics are impacting our business, as well as our customers. While we are watchful for the possible impacts of these issues, I'm pleased with the strength and stability of our footprint and specifically our customers. We continue to be pleased with our fundamental operating performance, including our growth efforts. 01:50 We reported net income available to common shareholders for the quarter of $112.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $121.6 million or $0.65 per diluted common share. The only material non-operating item this quarter was just over $10 million in merger-related expenses. Importantly, credit quality continues to be a bright spot for us. We reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter we've been able to post net recoveries. 02:24 We also reported a 22% decline in non-performing loans and leases during the quarter from an already relatively low position. From a balance sheet perspective, we reported net organic loan growth of over $300 million or 4.6% annualized and total deposit and customer repo growth of over $750 million or 7.7% annualized. Our loan growth this quarter was primarily within our C&I portfolio, while the deposit growth, which has historically been seasonally high in the first quarter was primarily driven by growth in non-interest DDA balances, which is a positive for us. 02:59 From a capital management perspective, we repurchased just over 5 million shares during the quarter, and our board increased the common dividend to $0.22 per share per quarter, marking the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases. I believe both of these actions demonstrate our Board and management team's confidence in the future of the New Cadence Bank. 03:18 Paul, I'll let you add some comments.\\nPaul Murphy: 03:21 Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making, the benefits of our merger from our customers, shareholders and teammate standpoint, all feel very positive to me from talking to others around the industry, it feels like our cultural fit is probably ahead of where some of the other deals are. We're working well together and collaboration is very high. We've done extensive planning and testing for our conversion, which is in line with our original time frame, expecting to do our conversion in the early fourth quarter of this year. 03:55 We're seeing pretty positive growth for customers really throughout the footprint. Texas and Florida stood out this quarter from a community bank standpoint, and our corporate and specialty teams reported nice growth throughout the footprint. 04:07 As I spend time with our bankers, we're making a lot of calls. We're out knocking on doors. We've returned to the office. It's a bit of a hybrid model, but we're out looking for, of course, loans, deposits, but assets under management and more insurance business. We're doing a lot of blocking and tackling. And the key notion here is that core growth is a key driver of shareholder value, and we're very determined and focused on delivering that. 04:32 With that, I'll turn it over to Valerie.\\nValerie Toalson: 04:34 Great. Thank you, Paul. Turning to this quarter's results Slide four provides a view of our summary income statement. And just as a reminder, with the October 29th closing of our merger, the first quarter of 2022 is the first reporting period that we've had a full quarter of the combined results of both legacy Cadence and legacy BancorpSouth. I would also remind you that fourth quarter 2021 results were adversely impacted by the day one provision for credit losses and other merger related items. 05:02 For the first quarter, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $112.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $121.6 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue or PPNR was $160 million or 1.36% of average assets. There are three key themes as you look at our results for the quarter. First, our continued loan growth has allowed us to grow net interest income and see positive movement in our margins. Second, our non-interest revenue businesses are performing very well. And third, credit quality continues to remain strong, supporting the lack of provision for credit losses for the quarter. 05:46 As shown on Slide five, we reported net interest income of $312 million and a net interest margin of 2.92% for the first quarter, up from 2.90% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of accretion, the linked quarter net interest margin increased by 3 basis points. The yield of net loans, excluding accretion was 3.96% for the first quarter, down 10 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to the full quarterly impact of the legacy Cadence variable rate loan portfolio, C&I portfolio. 06:21 Similarly, the full quarter's merger impact drove our securities yields higher and funding costs lower, offsetting the decline in loan yield. Our total cost of deposits declined to 15 basis points in the quarter. As we look forward, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from rate increases with 69% of our loan portfolio floating or variable. 06:43 Slides six and seven provide some additional color on our non-interest revenue and non-interest expense. Included in non-interest revenue, the quarter's insurance commission revenue benefit from seasonality, a high retention rate and new customer wins. Mortgage banking revenue increased largely due to the impact of rising interest rates on our MSR assets. And as we look at our expenses for the quarter, first quarter is generally seasonally high as a result of resets of payroll taxes and 401(k) match, as well as higher commissions led to seasonally higher insurance revenue. 07:17 Even so, the quarter's adjusted efficiency ratio was stable at 63.5%, and we continue to expect full realization of the merger efficiencies during 2023. While not related to the first quarter, we did announce an increase of our minimum wage to $18 per hour effective the beginning of April, as we continue to see wage pressure, particularly in some of our larger markets. 07:41 Before turning it over to Chris, I would like to touch briefly on the changes in tangible book value. Like many others in the industry, our tangible book value was impacted this quarter by the AOCI marks that are available for sale securities portfolio, due to the rising rate environment. To help clarify the impact, we have disclosed tangible book value per share, both including AOCI and excluding it. Excluding AOCI, tangible book value per share of $19.29 actually increased during the quarter despite our active share repurchases. It is also important to remember what drove this quarter's change in AOCI as simply a change in fair valuation driven by interest rate changes, and this fair value adjustment does not impact our regulatory capital ratios in any way. 08:26 I'll turn it over to Chris for a little more on our business activities highlight. Chris?\\nChris Bagley: 08:32 Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone. I would like to expand on the three key highlights for the quarter mentioned by Valerie, loan growth, credit quality, and non-interest revenue growth. As reflected on Slide eight, we reported net organic loan growth for the quarter of just over $300 million or 4.6% annualized, coming primarily in our C&I book. Hank will make some additional comments on the loan growth efforts in a moment. But as Paul mentioned, we saw a nice growth in our Texas and Florida markets within the community bank and across our footprint in the corporate banking and specialty lending units. 09:04 Credit quality continues to be a positive story for us, which is highlighted on Slide 10. As Dan mentioned, we reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported net recoveries. Our total non-performing loans declined $34.5 million or 22% during the quarter, bringing period-end NPLs to net loans and leases to 44 basis points, while non-performing assets also experienced a similar decline. 09:32 Non-interest revenue, which is highlighted on Slide 13, thus insurance having a nice quarter and reporting total commission revenue, up $36 million for the quarter or 17% for the first quarter of last year. Growth came primarily in our property and casualty portfolio as retention rates remain high and as we also picked up some nice customer wins. Mortgage reported origination volume of $804 million for the quarter with just over 70% being purchased. While we are pleased with production volume, rising rates do pressure our gain on sale margin, which is 1.24% for the first quarter. 10:07 Finally, I'd like to highlight our Wealth and Trust teams, which reported revenue for the quarter of $21.7 million. I'd also like to highlight that this revenue number is up from $8.4 million for the same quarter of '21 and reflects the contribution of the legacy CADE trust and wealth services and the Linscomb & Williams results. We're really excited about the synergies the combined companies bring to our non-interest revenue lines and the future benefits from the cross-selling opportunities, additional scale and market diversification created by the merger. 10:36 I will turn the call over to Hank for some comments on the corporate side of the bank. Hank?\\nHank Holmes: 10:43 Thank you, Chris. I was pleased to see that commercial loan growth in the quarter was spread throughout the corporate C&I teams across the footprint. Our bankers have been leveraging the expanded platform and bringing in more wins as the economy stabilized post-COVID. Specialized lending and renewable energy teams have been quite active, other areas are seeing payoff slow, and we have the teams in place to continue growth. 11:06 I am feeling positive about the growth this year as pipelines remain healthy. In particular, our technology, healthcare and C&I groups are seeing attractive opportunities in our combined markets and throughout the footprint. We are adding good CRE projects from our community bank and corporate CRE teams, primarily in multi-family housing. 11:25 Construction loans continue to fund, but we are still seeing lower utilization. Given the volatility in long-term interest rates, we do anticipate utilization in our construction portfolio to increase over the next 12 to 24 months to more normal or historical levels. Our focus on credit continues to be disciplined. We are not competing at higher leverage points with non-banks on EV loans. The markets continue to be competitive, but the pressure on terms and pricing seems to have settled some. Our teams have come together nicely, and I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm and commitment. I'm also an optimist and excited about many great successes to come for our organization. 11:57 Operator, our team is now ready to answer any questions.\\nOperator: 12:02 We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJon Arfstrom: 12:30 Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\\nDan Rollins: 12:32 Hey, Jon.\\nJon Arfstrom: 12:34 You talked a little bit about overall growth expectations for the company. I saw you put up $300 million in organic growth. And just there's a lot of churn between the two companies, I would guess, but just talk a little bit about your expectations? And is that a reasonable pace? Or do you expect that, that can accelerate a bit?\\nDan Rollins: 12:52 I'll let everybody jump in on that. There's lots of activity going on, on the growth side of the house. There has been some churn. We continue to see payoffs on CRE flow-through. There's just a lot of activity. Pipelines are also big. So Hank and Chris, you guys are driving some of that to add in.\\nHank Holmes: 13:13 Hey Jon, appreciate the question. So as I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of balanced growth. The pipelines continue to be strong, in my opinion. And I think that with some of the areas like in our renewable energy and certainly the energy component of our bank with prices where they are, some opportunities there. And the C&I teams are just getting a lot of looks. And so the activity is high. Chris, do you want to add something to that?\\nChris Bagley: 13:39 Yes. Just with rates trending up, that's probably going to slow down some of the churn, especially on a community bank, refinance side. But -- it also could impact maybe opportunities as folks are looking at higher interest rates on their projects until that factors in. So how is that right down the middle of the fairway for you?\\nDan Rollins: 13:57 We have some pretty significant unfunded construction lines out there.\\nChris Bagley: 14:00 Right, we did.\\nDan Rollins: 14:02 So yes, there's some activity going on, Jon. We're excited about what the team has been able to do in light of all the changes that we keep throwing out.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:10 Okay. So it feels good, maybe a little bit better is a good summary?\\nDan Rollins: 14:13 I think, we feel excited about the opportunities.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:16 Okay. Plenty of other place I could go, but just as long as we're on this topic, Hank, you talked about the competitive environment being settled some. And I think that's somewhat encouraging others have said it's ultra competitive. But can you give us a little bit more in terms of examples of what you're seeing there?\\nHank Holmes: 14:31 Sure. It's -- we're always -- we're in a competitive business and it's always competitive. So where I see some slowdown is, we obviously, in CRE, we saw rates fall dramatically over the last 24 months. That seems to have settled down. We're not chasing terms and leverage points on EV and other areas that we compete in are modest or where I would say historically, we're not chasing at this point. So I feel pretty good about where we are from the terms and pricing, but it is competitive.\\nChris Bagley: 15:05 A lot that covered there, and bring the two companies together, there's a lot more emphasis or just the market and type of customer base on the CRE side for legacy CADE. That's floating rate, so that's a nice pickup for us, especially in the rate environment we're moving into. We are still seeing in the community bank markets, upward pressure on rates there, everybody hold it. It's still pretty competitive out there, recently as last month, we saw some three handles, but now you're seeing all that move into the four, kind of a four handle side, not as many three handles. So good upward pressure on the right field as well.\\nJon Arfstrom: 15:41 Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nDan Rollins: 15:44 Thanks, Jon.\\nOperator: 15:47 The next question is from Catherine Mealor of KBW. Please go ahead.\\nCatherine Mealor: 15:53 Thanks. Good morning. Just want to say on the loan conversation and talk about loan yields. And maybe it's for Valerie. Just kind of walk us through, you mentioned 69% of your loan book is floating or variable. Can you just walk us through to remind us what percentage now today is floating immediately? And once we get past, let's just say we get 50 bps in May, so then we're kind of three rate hikes through, how much you're kind of coming off the floors? And then the -- kind of the timeline on the remaining variable piece of the portfolio, just to kind of get a sense as to how quickly we should see these loan yields move higher. Thanks.\\nValerie Toalson: 16:32 Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Catherine, for the questions. Great questions. Back -- last quarter, we said that it would take about 40 basis points movement in order to get our loans in average off the floors the $7.5 billion or so that we had on the floors. Well, we've had a whole lot of that movement actually in the market take place already. And so the next movement will definitely get those off their floors. We do have about $7.6 billion of our loan portfolio is actually floating. And so that's less than 30 days and so 28% of that book. 17:09 When you look at the total book, we've got about 50% of our entire portfolio that will reprice over the next year. And so that gives you a little bit better timing on some of that, with most of that actually coming in the next three month period. And so again, that positions us really nicely as we look at some of the increases that we expect coming down the road. 17:34 When you take a look at some of the portfolio, we are starting to see the impact of some of the rate increases on some of the renewals come through as not only renewals, but also loans that are simply just repricing, starting to see that come through, and we'll definitely see that impact more in the second quarter. New loans on average are coming on around the 360 level, but again, about two-thirds of those are variable rate. And so those will continue to move. Does that help, what you were looking for?\\nCatherine Mealor: 18:09 Yes, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then my next question is on the expenses. So I fully appreciate that this quarter is elevated, because it's a 1Q elevation and then we don't have the full impact of the cost savings in. Is there -- can you just kind of help us take a step back big picture maybe what's a good quarterly run rate we should get to kind of by the end of the year once we have the cost savings fully baked in? Or any kind of guidance you could give us on where you think the expense run rate is going just to make sure we're all on the same page. Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 18:42 I remember, we're on a 4Q integration plan. And so I don't know that we'll have a good clean run rate in 4Q. So I would put that out there first. I think we expect 1Q to be fully baked in, as we get into 4Q and we're -- as Paul said, we're on schedule, we're on task, we've actually completed two huge hurdles just in the last 1.5 months, working towards our full integration. But you're right, 1Q expense run is high. There's lots of things that are in there just naturally. And then when you look at the things we were doing through the merger, I feel pretty confident that we're on our run rate to exceed -- meet or exceed the numbers that we put out there. Valerie has been looking at numbers up while I've been talking.\\nValerie Toalson: 19:26 Yes. I think what might help, I know that the first quarter has a lot of noise and of course, the fourth quarter was very noisy given the timing of the merger date. Last quarter, we disclosed our combined third quarter F '21 expenses. And on an adjusted basis, that was $277 million, compared to the first quarter adjusted expenses of $281 million. But as we talked about, this first quarter did have the resets of the 401(k) match and the payroll taxes. 20:00 And so if you normalize that, and then we also had a bonus that we provided to a number of our employees for inflationary purposes in the first quarter. That amounted about $2.8 million. So when you combine all of that together, effectively, third quarter '21 to first quarter '21, expenses actually came down about $7.4 million. And so that will give you a little bit of a sense of some of the initial incremental merger cost saves that we're starting to see kind of in the underlying foundation. 20:35 That being said, it's going to be bumpy until we get through this conversion. We do have -- we talked about we did increase our hourly wage to $18 per hour. We also have our merit increases in the July 1 time period. And so all that will be a little bit bumpy until we do get finished with the conversion. But of course, none of this includes savings from any branch efficiencies -- and then certainly, some of the savings that we know will come after we are running on one operating system.\\nDan Rollins: 21:10 The wage pressure is still big. And so Valerie hit two topics there. You want to make sure we cover again. So we did change our incoming wage minimum to $18 an hour on April 1. That's a pretty big run rate. That's going to be close to $10 million on an annual run to plug that in. And then our normal merit cycle for everyone that wasn't in that group hits on July 1. So we will see some upward pressure on comp, even excluding the savings and the drop-offs that are there, we are seeing, you saw headcount drop in the quarter, and we continue to see some of that. But as Valerie said, it's going to be bumpy as we move down the path.\\nCatherine Mealor: 21:55 Great. That's clear. Appreciate that, and it's very helpful. Thank you.\\nDan Rollins: 22:00 Thanks, Catherine.\\nOperator: 22:02 The next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist. Please go ahead.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:10 Thanks. Good morning.\\nDan Rollins: 22:11 Hey, Jenni.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:13 Hi. Just curious, the asset quality is very, very strong. But what do you think are the most vulnerable loan buckets as rates go up and most susceptible here to rising loan losses over the next several quarters?\\nDan Rollins: 22:32 Yes, that's a good question. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of net recoveries. We haven't experienced a lot of losses likely. So I guess looking forward is an important piece of that. I don't know that I have one bucket that I would want to call out. Paul, you got anything you want to add to that?\\nPaul Murphy: 22:46 Well, I would just observe that the -- really the merger is a huge de-risking of both balance sheet and diversification of the loan portfolio. And yes, like Dan, I wouldn't point to any one category as higher risk. I think the risk is well managed across the company. And I would say maybe the previous higher-risk energy portfolio has been de-risked significantly with higher rates as we're seeing profitability in the E&P sector is spectacular. And that, of course, benefits the midstream and the oilfield service portfolio. So -- it's a granular, very diverse credit profile and one of the key reasons why we like the combination so much.\\nDan Rollins: 23:35 Yes. From a credit quality perspective, this is the best credit we've been posting for either of us in quite some time.\\nHank Holmes: 23:41 And I would just add to that. And when you look at the balance sheets of the businesses, they're extremely strong, a lot of liquidity there. I think we're well positioned if we do have some bumps in the quarters to come from an economic perspective and with rates increasing, but I think we're well prepared for that. And I think our borrowers are as well.\\nJennifer Demba: 24:00 What do you think a normal range of annual loan losses is for this company over an economic cycle?\\nDan Rollins: 24:09 I don't have a number to stick on to that. I mean that's a good question. Valerie, you want to add?\\nValerie Toalson: 24:16 Yes. I think that's a little bit of a challenging number. But as far as like annualized net charge-offs, legacy Cadence, we would guide toward a 25 basis points normalized over a period of time, net charge-offs. I'd say that's lower from the legacy BancorpSouth history. And so something below those lines?\\nPaul Murphy: 24:42 When you look at the COVID stress test and some of the portfolios that you might have been concerned about hospitality at legacy BancorpSouth, I mean it just came through with great marks. And so I think Valerie is on the right path, 25 basis points might have been sort of what we thought about for CADE, but something less than that. So combined, I don't know, 10 to 15 basis points. But to hit a narrow range.\\nDan Rollins: 25:10 We're clearly watching the clouds that are out there. I mean, I think your question is fair. It appears that there could be some economic headwinds that were there. We're hoping that they blow by and we don't experience some of that. But we have to be prepared for that.\\nJennifer Demba: 25:27 Thanks so much.\\nDan Rollins: 25:28 Thanks, Jenni.\\nOperator: 25:31 The next question is from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Rose: 25:37 Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So it looks like the buybacks were weighted towards the back half of the quarter. But as we move forward, just given the drop in DCE and understand the conversation, Valerie, about the mechanics of the AOCI hit. But would that give any sort of pause to future repurchases? And should the stock remain under pressure? Is there capacity at this point? Do you think to actually increase the size of the repurchase? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 26:14 Yes. So I think a couple of things. Valerie can certainly jump in here. But when you look at the tangible book value, excluding AOCI, we were actually up in the quarter. AOCI to use another word would be transitory and over time neither one of us have had a habit of trading in that portfolio, so that will work its way through over time and the fact that the tangible book value went up excluding that, which is on Page four of the deck, I think, is a positive thing. I think we want to be opportunistic on buyback. I don't think we want to be locked out of the market, but I also think we need to be cognizant of all the moving pieces, which includes AOCI, Valerie?\\nValerie Toalson: 26:51 Yes. No, I think you really hit on all the points. I think certainly, we've always been opportunistic in the past. The first quarter was pretty heavy activity. It may be a little bit more measured going forward. But again, we have a history, and I anticipate that we'll continue to be opportunistic and do what makes the most sense, balancing all the other things that we have going on. Obviously, loan growth continues to be picking up. And so that is obviously another primary use of capital.\\nMichael Rose: 27:23 Understood. Thanks. And then just on the accretion this quarter. Obviously, it was a little bit higher than I think I was looking for at least understand how much you have left. Was there any sort of accelerated paydowns in there? And then, I think you might have given a schedule or expectation last quarter should -- that we should kind of expect on a go-forward basis.\\nValerie Toalson: 27:46 Yes, that's a good question. There was a little bit of accelerated accretion there. That tends to be bumpy. We had -- we're still looking at, oh gosh, probably about $25 million, $30 million of additional accretion as we go through the rest of the year in scheduled. But again, I would anticipate that it's probably going to end up being a little bit more of that simply because of payoffs.\\nMichael Rose: 28:15 Understood. And maybe just finally for me, just two kind of quick housekeeping questions. With the conversion coming in the fourth quarter, I assume a lot of the cost saves will come in and around there. But how much of the cost saves have you realized today? Because I think you targeted 75% for this year. And then just on the one-time cost. Any changes there? I think you had originally estimated $125 million. Any changes there? And how much have you recognized to-date? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 28:43 Yes. I don't know that there's any change in any of those numbers just the quick answer there. I think the one-time cost, those are hard for you to see sometimes, because some of those costs were incurred pre-closing on the seller side. So you don't see all of that flowing through. We had a relatively low number this quarter. I would suspect that we will see some increasing cost as we move into the next couple of quarters, because we have some things we've got to spend money forward through that computer conversion in 4Q. But from a cost save perspective, I think we feel like we're in really good shape to hit or exceed the numbers that we put out there. 29:19 You're right. As you're looking out to the back half of the year, the biggest pieces of it will fall off in the fourth quarter, but there's little pieces that have been coming along all the way through. Early on, I said we had converted our mortgage shop all onto the same origination platform early in the year. We're in the process of converting the mortgage servicing onto the same platform here in the not-too-distant future. I mentioned a minute ago that we passed now two pretty big hurdles. We actually upgraded and moved our main processing box just over the past weekend. It puts us in a position to be able to do what we need to do that way. 29:54 And we've also upgraded our card processing all the transactions that flow through on the debit card, credit card side, 100s of 1,000s of transactions a day are flowing through, and that was all upgraded just in the last month. So we're making great progress towards the conversion in the fourth quarter, and I think we're very confident we'll hit our numbers.\\nValerie Toalson: 30:14 Yes. The only other thing I would really add to that is, we've incurred about $55 million-ish or so pre-tax, when you look at the fourth quarter, first quarter and then actually looking back at the third quarter of '21, some of that, that was a little bit early. And so as Dan put it, there will be some more. We may end up beating that estimated overall cost.\\nDan Rollins: 30:42 Beating as an coming in less.\\nValerie Toalson: 30:43 Coming in less. It's a good clarification. But again, as Dan said it, there's a lot of activity happening in the latter half of this year.\\nMichael Rose: 30:53 Great. So progress continues. Thanks for taking all my questions.\\nDan Rollins: 30:56 Thanks, Michael. Good to hear from you.\\nOperator: 31:00 The next question is from Brad Milsaps of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDan Rollins: 31:05 Hi, Brad.\\nBrad Milsaps: 31:07 Hi, good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking my questions. Not to continue to belabor the cost name, but just kind of wanted to put a finer point on it, Valerie. It sounded like you said that from the third quarter to the first quarter, your expenses may have -- would have been down maybe $7 million from cost savings. I think you initially identified maybe $20 million quarterly, you're going to spend another $2 million, $2.5 million a quarter kind of on inflationary items. So kind of back of the envelope, would that give you sort of $10 million to kind of fall out of the quarterly run rate, all else equal as you get past the conversion date. Does that math still make sense?\\nDan Rollins: 31:46 Brad, you run that through my brain again.\\nValerie Toalson: 31:49 Yes. So post conversion, as we look into 2023, we do anticipate achieving all of the cost saves that we laid out in the document. We talked in the announcement, that's $78 million. And then obviously, we have talked about the impact of the $18 per hour is about $10 million per year. And so there's obviously a little bit of puts and takes throughout there. But you can count on us achieving those merger cost saves. We're committed to that.\\nDan Rollins: 32:27 Yes, I think from a big perspective, Brad, when you look at us, I think, we're still very encouraged that the merger gives us the opportunity to not cost out. The wage pressure that we're feeling, that's affecting all of us. That's nothing unique to our company. Everybody is feeling the pressure that's on NSF/OD fees for the industry is impacting all of us not just us. So there are certainly some industry things that are impacting us, but we as a standalone, we think that the ability to bring cost out through our merger is a real positive for us, and we'll meet or exceed probably both sides of those numbers.\\nBrad Milsaps: 33:10 Great. Thank you. And then just as my follow-up, Valerie. Could you talk about maybe plans for the existing remaining liquidity that you have sitting in Fed funds? Do you plan to put that into the bond portfolio with rates higher or just kind of wait and see with what loan growth does. Just kind of curious kind of how to think about the size of the balance sheet and kind of the different categories going forward?\\nValerie Toalson: 33:34 Yes, absolutely. First quarter is -- has a lot of seasonality on our deposits. We do have a number of large municipal customers, who -- with the tax inflows come in, and then you see those come out in the second quarter. And so part of that liquidity will certainly be to offset some of that volatility and some of that seasonality shift that we will see -- or we anticipate seeing in the second quarter. That obviously using those funds for the loan growth is first and foremost. 34:05 And then it's really going to be effectively what's left over and making sure then that we invest it properly. We do have a lot of cash flow coming off that securities portfolio, about $700 million per quarter. And so that helps fund a whole lot of loans, but also may allow for some reinvestment at some higher rates. Over time, we would like to get the securities book as a percent of assets down as a percent, but that's going to take some time given where we are today.\\nDan Rollins: 34:38 The loan guys need to make more loans.\\nValerie Toalson: 34:39 Absolutely.\\nBrad Milsaps: 34:43 Great. Thank you very much.\\nDan Rollins: 34:44 Thanks, Brad.\\nOperator: 34:47 The next question is from Kevin Fitzsimmons of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 34:54 Hey, good morning, everyone.\\nDan Rollins: 34:55 Hey, good morning, Kevin.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 34:58 Hey, Dan, I just wanted to ask about -- it seems like there was a change in treatment on the MSR adjustment, and I definitely recognize that some peers don't break that out and exclude it. And it is on one hand you got hurt by rising rates on the AOCI. So it doesn't seem fair to just arbitrarily decide to exclude that. But you got -- it had been your practice or legacy BancorpSouth practice to exclude it when talking about core performance. So I'm just curious about is this a change going forward and how you're going to view it? And what would the puts and takes in deciding to keep that within core earnings? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 35:43 Yes, that's a great question. And you're spot on. I think when we look back over time, when we started pulling that out at legacy BXS, it was a big part of the number. It's become more and more immaterial in our process as we've grown, we've been looking at what peers are doing and what's out there. And so we did pull that out of our adjusted numbers, and we also adjusted the -- adjusted numbers looking backwards, so the -- what you see in the deck is all uniform across. But you're right, we've left it in, because it's a much less material number today than it was when we started adjusting for it as a much smaller organization when we were $10 billion.\\nValerie Toalson: 36:19 And that will be a consistent treatment as we go forward.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 36:23 Okay, okay. Great. And can you just give us a sense for a lot of -- how to view the ACL and where that settles going forward. On one hand, I think the combined -- I think you guys might have given up before that on a combined basis what your day one CECL might have been. But on the other hand, we have a little more uncertainty today just with inflation in geopolitical things. And just wondering how to view that ACL going forward, what we should expect? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 37:02 Yes, that's a really good question. It doesn't have a very good answer and you're exactly right, there's a lot of moving parts. The future risk that's out there is the dark cloud that you're looking at history, four quarters in a row of net recoveries would tell you that credit is in really fine shape. But what the future is bringing to us is the unknown, and so to be prepared for that. I don't know that we have a number to tell you where I think it would shake out. But we're certainly watching our modeling, we're making sure we're accounting for the potential risks that are out there.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 37:37 I guess, put it another way. I mean, there's -- I would suspect there's still opportunity for credit leverage for that ratio to come down, but maybe less aggressively than it might have been able to -- or we might have thought a quarter ago?\\nDan Rollins: 37:53 I think that's probably fair. I think, again, the unknown is what's happening in the economy with an inverted yield curve and potential military skirmishes around the world, I think that, that's the unknown and what that does to the economy. That puts the cloud over us without those things, I think your statement would be spot on.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 38:19 Okay. All right. Thanks very much, Dan.\\nDan Rollins: 38:22 Thanks, Kevin.\\nOperator: 38:25 [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.\\nMatt Olney: 38:34 Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\\nDan Rollins: 38:35 Good morning, Matt.\\nMatt Olney: 38:37 Most of my questions have been addressed, but I wanted to ask about deposit growth. Yes, it looked good in the quarter, but you mentioned there were some seasonal tailwinds that you guys benefited from. Can you quantify this? Just trying to appreciate if we saw any true sticky deposit growth in 1Q and then kind of the outlook for deposit growth from here? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 38:58 Yes. So 1Q has historically been the best deposit growth quarter for both of our companies on a standalone. We've not experienced a second quarter as a combined company together yet. So this will be new for us. But second quarter has also been the weakest quarter historically for both of us. So I think the anticipation would be that with the municipal deposits that we were both carrying coming into the merger that we would see similar to what we had seen in the past as standalone entity. So when you look back, I think both of us had seen flat to down deposits in 2Q for the last several years, and I would think that all things being equal, I don't know why it wouldn't be the same this year.\\nMatt Olney: 39:38 Got it. Okay. That's helpful. On the mortgage front, it looked like the percent of production sold was down this quarter around 50%, it had been at 78% range over the last few years. Is this a timing issue? Or just structure you guys choosing to sell less the production and to balance sheet more of that? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 40:04 Yes, nothing has changed from a structure standpoint, there's timing and there's product. So if there's a product mix, we have been retaining the arms on the balance sheet. And so if we're putting more arms or producing more arms, those would stay, but there's been no change in our process. Chris, you want to add in there?\\nChris Bagley: 40:22 Yes, no change. There's probably some noise from the combination of the company. It just hasn't shook out yet as well because both sides are doing mortgages, portfolio mortgages, and we were doing a lot more volume relatively speaking, on the secondary market side. So I think it just takes some time for that to sort of balance itself and see some trends that make sense.\\nDan Rollins: 40:41 And remember, we finished the merger, the consolidation of all of our origination on the one platform in the first quarter. So there's certainly some timing issues and work going on there.\\nMatt Olney: 40:53 Yes. Okay. Thanks guys.\\nDan Rollins: 40:57 Thank you, Matt.\\nOperator: 41:00 This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\\nDan Rollins: 41:08 All right. Thank you all. In closing, I believe our results speak for themselves in terms of the early successes of the combination of our two companies. The fact that we've continued to report meaningful balance sheet growth so soon after the legal merger closing is a tremendous testament for the efforts of our collective group of bankers as well as the cohesiveness of our back office and the credit support functions. 41:29 Aside from industry-wide headwinds on mortgage, our fee income businesses continue to grow at impressive rates. As we look forward, we're challenged -- we've challenged our frontline teammates to build on this momentum, while our back office and supports personnel continue their efforts working towards the successful completion of our integration efforts later this fall. It truly is an exciting time for the New Cadence Bank. Thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all again soon.\\nOperator: 41:58 The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

Welcome to Axalta’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation by management. Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available through May 3rd. Those listening after today's call should please note that the information provided in the recording will not be updated and therefore may no longer be current. 00:32 I'll now turn the call over to Christopher Evans. Please go ahead, sir.\\nChristopher Evans: 00:36 Thank you and good morning. This is Chris Evans, VP of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in Axalta and welcome you to our first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Robert Bryant, CEO and Sean Lannon, CFO. 00:55 Yesterday afternoon we released our quarterly financial results and posted a slide presentation along with commentary to the Investor Relations section of our website at axalta.com, which we will be referencing during this call. Both our prepared remarks and discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on Axalta's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks and actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements. 01:29 Please note that the company is under no obligation to provide updates to these forward-looking statement. Our remarks and the slide presentation also contain various non-GAAP financial measures. In the appendix to the slide presentation we've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our filings with the SEC. 01:58 I will now turn the call over to Robert.\\nRobert Bryant: 02:01 Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As most probably saw a few weeks ago, Chris Evans recently joined Axalta, the lead Investor Relations and we're very excited to have him as part of our team. 02:13 With that, I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Let me begin by sharing how proud I am of what we have been able to accomplish this quarter and thank our global team for their hard work. Momentum continues to build in each of our businesses today, because of our team's customer focus and dedication to ensure that we deliver on our goal. 02:37 The entire Axalta team deserves credit for fostering growth and minimizing the financial impact of the various geopolitical crises and the ongoing supply chain challenges. I want to specifically call out our China team where essential management and our manufacturing workforce volunteer to shelter in place at our plants and at our customers plants, throughout the weeks long COVID-19 lockdown to keep operations running and meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for your incredible commitment and resiliency. 03:11 Now to the key first quarter highlights on Slide three. We reported a strong result again this quarter and have a lot to be proud of given the overall environment. Constant-currency net sales growth of 13% exceeded our prior estimate in both Performance and Mobility Coatings. Adjusted EBIT of $120 million achieved the very top-end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was above our guidance range given the flow-through of strong earnings, modest benefits from a lower share count, and a slightly lower adjusted tax rate. I'm pleased with these results given the unprecedented degree of challenges, we had to overcome. 03:52 These include, first, the rapid pace of variable cost inflation, which we experienced across most cost categories and well above what we had factored into our original Q1 guidance construct; second, raw material and labor shortages, which created a difficult operating environment constraining many customers in our ability to fully serve a healthy consumer demand environment; and finally, direct and indirect impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic issues, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as the effects of zero COVID policies in China. 04:27 Despite the approximately $22 million in earnings headwinds these three items created versus our January guidance framework we were still able to deliver a solid quarter and exceed our sales guidance, as strong pricing and better volumes yielded better-than-expected 10% year-over-year organic ex-FX growth, and also delivered EBIT at the top end of our range. 04:51 Volume improved 1% year-over-year with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, for the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth was supported by ongoing recovery, as well as from share gains that we are driving across the portfolio. These achievements reflect our customers' preference for our differentiated technologies and our nice recognition of the great work from our commercial teams across all of our business lines. Axalta is committed to driving secular growth and we are making encouraging progress, a stronger share position has allowed us to better leverage our fixed cost position driving higher incremental margins, which will serve us well as markets continue to recover the pre-pandemic levels. 05:35 We realized a remarkable 9% price-mix in the quarter, up from a reported 3.6% last quarter, driven by pricing actions that we have continued to implement in order to offset the impact of cost inflation. Both segments have shown strong pricing gains from past quarters with Mobility Coatings reaching record quarterly percent growth. While we are happy with our pricing progress the unprecedented rate of variable cost inflation was driven Q1 profitability well below our historical low-20s percentage adjusted EBITDA margin range. New pricing actions are already underway to offset existing uncovered and anticipated further inflationary costs coming as a result of higher oil prices and tight supply-demand balances in many commodity chains. 06:25 We expect that our margins will begin to recover in the second quarter as we drive further price improvement and enhance our fixed cost leverage position. During the quarter, we also repurchased $175 million in shares. At the current valuation we see tremendous value in our equity and we'll remain opportunistic as we prioritize capital deployment for generating meaningful shareholder return while balancing a conservative balance sheet. 06:51 Moving onto Slide four. Axalta occupies unique and highly profitable positions in the coating industry. We're aligned with mega trends that we believe create a strong growth trajectory for years to come. However, supply chain challenges have drastically impacted global trade, constrained demand and reduced global GDP. Recent geopolitical dynamics have only increased the temporary strain on global operations and worse than short-term visibility. While we continue to have strong conviction in our strategic ambitions and direction, the degree of macro uncertainty today makes it challenging to forecast beyond the near-term with high confidence. Therefore, we're only providing Q2 guidance today. 07:35 Nonetheless I continue to see strong underlying trends. We're launching new innovative products every quarter and each business is making strong progress toward our growth ambition by executing on topline growth. In Refinish our highly profitable industry leading aftermarket Auto Coatings business, the team is delivering on several strategic imperatives. First, increased market access, this quarter we won over 500 net body shops globally and well over 200 new stock point through distribution customers. Second we're growing our premium market leadership, we are the leader with MSOs, who continued to be allocated more workflow from insurance companies in North America, as well as independent body shops. We are retaining and winning new customers each quarter as we capitalize on our unique customer value proposition. Third, we continue to gain share in mainstream and economy segment, where we haven't had as large of historical presence. 08:38 The addition of new points of distribution is helping to build a sales pipeline in under-represented geographies and markets. We have witnessed good growth progress and execution on all fronts this quarter as evident in our above market volume growth. Another area of focus is the integration of U-POL. We are well underway in integrating the business and executing on cost synergies, but our true enthusiasm for the acquisition is centered around realizing commercial synergies, which we believe will further the U-POL value creation opportunity beyond what we previously communicated. U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in the automotive, body repair business namely in fillers, putties, glazes and aerosols, where Axalta did not participate in a meaningful way. 09:27 Moving into these categories positions us to capture more repair dollars per vehicle. We can also drive commercial synergies through maximizing the cross-selling of Axalta and U-POL products across our global customer base. We're already beginning to see the value creation play out as our distribution partners and key body shop accounts are beginning to stock U-POL products. In addition U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in both consumer and industrial protective coatings. 09:58 In Industrial Coatings, we are driving organic growth in a constrained environment led by strong pricing gains. Industrial price-mix increased by a mid-teens percentage year-over-year and by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. A number of additional pricing actions were instituted in late Q1, which should sustain positive pricing momentum into the remainder of the year reporting a return to significantly higher profitability. 10:24 In Mobility Coatings, our industry-leading light-vehicle and commercial OEM business, we secured record pricing gains and outperformed the market from a volume perspective in Q1. Pricing momentum is building every month. While we are negotiating better pricing we are also building a more inflation resilient portfolio by partnering with our customers to increase the percentage of Mobility customer contracts with indexed pricing mechanisms, now between 35% and 40% for the entire segment. 10:56 Recent share gains and light vehicle are driving above market growth and setting us up with the right customer mix -- when global production returns to normalized levels in the future. In commercial vehicle, we continue to hold the leadership position globally in heavy-duty truck market. We are focused on pricing traction to help offset cost inflation and see strong market demand despite customer production constraints. Lastly, we're driving growth across all end markets with innovative and differentiated product offering. Two new exciting product launches just received recognition with the prestigious 2022 Edison Award, which on are some of the most innovative product developments in the world. Our patented Spies Hecker full waterborne repaired system technology was awarded bronze in Edison sustainability category and represents the first paint offering for the collision repair market where all coatings layers from primer to clear coat are water based. 11:59 This is truly sustainable solution provides best-in-class appearance and performance, while reducing solvent emissions by more than 60%. Next Axalta’s high resolution digital paint coating system won bronze in Edison's material science category. This patent in coating technology supports the mass customization megatrend with a novel coating it can be applied with zero over spray and reduces energy consumption as well as waste generated from the masking process. These are just two great examples of Axalta's innovation pipeline and product differentiation, which we are supporting customers productivity needs in sustainability ambitions, creating a large market pull for our offering. 12:44 Turning to Slide five and six for a discussion of key market and demand trends. Vehicle miles traveled in the United States and Europe have nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but changes in driving behavior, namely the prevalence of work-from-home, seems to have led to lower congestion levels and less collision claims than before the start of the pandemic. Based on paint consumption data from our proprietary e-commerce platform we estimate Q1 body shop activity remained in the mid-80s% and low 90s% respectively for the US and Europe relative to 2019, consistent with the level of collision claims. 13:23 Within the quarter our U.S. body shop customers reported a step-up in activity during March that we believe reflected some modest market improvement though remains constrained by a growing backlog of repair work given parts and labor shortages at the body-shop level. We believe that return to in-person work is an important factor in driving market recovery and are encouraged by U.S. office occupancy, which improved from the low 20s% to 42% versus prior year. 13:55 In Industrial coatings, a healthy demand environment was again limited by supply constraints, namely in Building Products and General Industrial. In total these constraints represented a mid-to-high single digit percent drag against our 1% volume growth in the period. Regionally North America and Asia Pacific contributed most significantly to our year-over-year growth. 14:19 Moving to Mobility Coatings, the expected normalization of global auto production rates in 2022 has been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as China COVID-19 lockdowns, resulting in downward revisions of earlier production estimates. Full-year 2022 global production industry estimates are now forecasted to be 80.6 million, 4% above 2021, but still 9% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. 14:50 Once supply chain constraints and cost headwinds abate the benefit to Axalta will be significant. This is highlighted by an approximately $140 million earnings gap between our trailing 12-month Mobility Coatings Adjusted EBIT and our pre-pandemic 2019 profitability levels, when global auto builds reached 89 million. We're not sitting still and waiting for the market to recover. In the current environment we focus on what we can control, prioritizing productivity, better price to offset cost inflation, and new market gains. Following these actions, we expect to be in an even better position once supply chain constraints diminish and the market recovers. 15:36 In Commercial Vehicle, where we have an industry-leading share in North America and EMEA, strong demand is outpacing constrained production rates. Heavy-duty and medium-duty truck order backlog is now 11-months and eight months, respectively, creating a long-dated growth dynamic for production rates to climb beyond 2022. 15:56 Moving to Slide seven, I’ll cover price cost and our focus on margin recovery. First, I’d like to remind everyone that we have a successful history of managing inflationary periods and quickly recovering loss profitability, our business is resilient. We have the ability to increase price when it's needed. 16:15 From the chart on this slide you can get a sense of the pace of inflation we have experienced. Even though this inflationary period is uniquely rapid and broad-based, we are already making great progress towards offsetting the impact. 16:28 In Performance Coatings, we have been able to quickly raise price and have offset the majority of the $220 million cumulative year-over-year variable cost and logistics inflation incurred since the second of 2021. In Mobility Coatings, lagging index pricing mechanisms in some contracts, and multi-quarter pricing discussions in others, mean we have begun to accelerate pricing. Every business at Axalta is focused on margin recovery and we expect to cover the majority of existing price cost gaps and incremental headwinds by Q4 of this year at the consolidated level. 17:07 Before I turn the call over to Sean to discuss our financial results, I wanted to touch briefly on some ESG highlights from the quarter on Slide eight. As you may remember we announced our 2030 ESG goals in January, which reflect how meaningful progress in environmental, social and corporate governance is central to Axalta’s strategy and success. We have already begun to execute against these goals and have engaged with many of our customers and other stakeholders to discuss our plans. 17:36 A major commitment is for us to develop new sustainable technologies and increase the proportion of our sales and sustainable solutions. As many of our mobility customers are rapidly shifting to produce more electric vehicles we're aligning our technology to support them and to drive growth in our own business. Our new AquaEC Flex product for the mobility sector is a great example of our technology and innovation investments being deeply connected with key sustainability mega trends. In addition to the two Edison Award products, I mentioned this product enables our OEM customers to reduce CO2 emissions in their own operations by lowering the temperatures required for an electric vehicles more intricate body frame. This is a great launch for us, well aligned with our ESG commitment. 18:25 Now I'll turn the call over to Sean to discuss our financial results beginning with Slide nine.\\nSean Lannon: 18:30 Thanks, Robert, and good morning. As you heard the first quarter delivered strong pricing execution with contributions from across the portfolio. Healthy demand environment supported volume growth, but the continuation of supply constraints was a headwind and also contributed to further challenges from cost inflation. 18:48 Net sales of $1.2 billion increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter, while constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by pricing actions, demand strength across most of our businesses, and benefits from two acquisitions we completed in 2021. 19:05 Constant currency net sales growth included a 19% increase from Performance Coatings and 3% growth from Mobility Coatings, reflecting Light Vehicle up 1% while Commercial Vehicle was up an impressive 10%. First quarter volume improved 1% with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, offset by a low single-digits percent decline in Light Vehicle volumes, which outpaced the approximate 5% decline in global Q1 auto production. 19:34 Price-mix contribution increased 9% in the aggregate, up from our reported 3.6% last quarter, with improvement across all end-markets led by mid-teens improvement in Industrial Coatings. FX translation was a headwind of 3% for Q1, driven by the weaker Euro and Turkish Lira. 19:53 First quarter Adjusted EBIT was $120 million versus $183 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting pricing actions, strong demand, and volume trends across all end-markets except Light Vehicle, which was more than offset by substantial increases in raw material and logistics cost inflation realized versus the first quarter of 2021. I did want to note that we took a $6 million accounting charge associated with accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence reserves, and these are excluded from our adjusted EBIT stemming from sanctions imposed on Russia. 20:28 Turning to Slide 10. Performance Coatings Q1 net sales increased 15.1% year-over-year and 18.6% ex-FX, driven by 2.5% higher volumes, a 10.7% increase in average price-mix, up from the 4.6% reported last quarter, and a 5.4% increase from acquisitions. 20:50 Refinish reported a 15.6% net sales increase, or 19.7% ex-FX, driven by a high single-digit price-mix benefits, above-market volume growth, and by a high single-digit contribution from the U-POL acquisition. Volumes increased in every region despite raw material supply impacting our ability to meet all of our demand with the exception of China, where COVID-19 lockdowns drove a modest volume decline. 21:17 Industrial Q1 net sales increased 14.5%, or 17.3% ex-FX, driven largely by mid-teens percent improvement in average price-mix, as well as a low single-digit acquisition contribution, and slightly positive volume growth. Demand trends in most of the Industrial end-businesses we serve remained healthy during the period; though supply constraints were a limiting factor, representing a high-single digit percent drag on sales. 21:46 Performance Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $95 million versus $117 million in Q1 2021, driven by ongoing volume growth and drop through benefits of price-mix, which were more than offset by headwinds from higher variable costs. The adjusted EBIT margin for the segment decreased to 11.6% from 16.6% in the prior-year period given the drivers noted. 22:11 Moving to Slide 11. Mobility Coatings net sales increased 3% in Q1 ex-FX, including a 4.9% price-mix tailwind offset by 1.9% lower volumes. The 1.9% volume decreases improved markedly from the 11% decrease last quarter thanks to stronger demand from our customer base, including new business starting to come on line. 22:35 Light Vehicle net sales increased 1% ex-FX in the quarter, including a 3.5% volume decrease, which outperformed a global auto production decline of approximately 5%. Price increased by mid single-digits. Commercial Vehicle Q1 net sales increased 10% ex-FX, driven by strong truck production globally, excluding China. Price-mix also increased mid single-digits. 23:01 Mobility Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $1 million versus $39 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBIT and associated margins in Q1 were impacted by variable cost inflation, with only modest offsets and positive pricing. Pricing gains are accelerating and we expect to cover the majority of incremental variable cost inflation between Q2 and Q4. 23:23 Moving to our debt and liquidity summary on Slide 12. Axalta’s Q1 balance sheet and liquidity profile remained solid. We ended the quarter with slightly over $1.1 billion in total liquidity. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1 times, reflecting an increase from 3.5 times at December 31st. Net leverage remains somewhat elevated due to the seasonal phasing of free cash flow and share repurchases totaling $175 million in the quarter. We continue to expect this to drop as we move to the back end of the year on stronger full-year operating results and normal free cash flow generation. 24:00 On Slide 13, we'll review Q2 guidance and full-year commentary. For the second quarter net sales we expect between 11% and 13% year-over-year growth, including a 4% FX headwinds and a 4% positive M&A contribution. The top line guide assumes low double-digit better pricing, continuing the acceleration of gains we've seen in recent quarters. Our forecast also includes a 2% to 3% sales headwind from China COVID lock-downs and from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 24:33 We expect to generate adjusted EBIT of $135 million to $165 million in the second quarter. With D&A of approximately $80 million inclusive of $24 million of step up D&A. Interest expense for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately $34 million, where adjusted earnings per share we anticipate a range of $0.35 to $0.45 for the second quarter inclusive of an FX headwind of $0.02 per share. Within our second quarter forecast, we further assume raw material inflation in the high '20s as a percentage versus Q2, 2021. 25:11 As we look for the full-year, it remains challenging to provide a detailed forecast given the degree of supply chain and geopolitical uncertainty. Nonetheless looking ahead, we expect strong mid-teens annual organic growth in both Performance and Mobility Coatings, driven by pricing actions already being executed and volume growth from modest market recoveries and share gains. 25:34 We are encouraged by refinish recovery given improved vehicle miles driven and upward trending office occupancy rates. But we remain measured in our outlook as we monitor the possible impacts from regional and global impacts from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as impacts from the extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China. 25:53 For mobility global auto build rates have been revised lower month-after-month by industry consultants and have settled close to our current 80 million production rate assumption, which is slightly above the 79 million we last forecasted. At these levels, we expect to see annual volume uplift from market growth plus upside from new customer wins. Likewise global medium-duty and heavy-duty truck build rates are projected to increase 4% in 2022, ex-China with our commercial vehicle volumes likely to exceed market rates given our strong and growing positions. 26:28 Regarding cost factors, our current assessment is that rates of overall raw material and cost inflation will continue at high levels. Given current baseline expectations and assuming Brent crude between $110 and $115 per barrel. We expect to largely cover the existing price cost gap and incremental headwinds this year with some lag in Mobility Coatings being offset by strength in Performance Coatings. Altogether, we anticipate stronger earnings performance this year versus 2021. 26:58 Lastly, our typical second half weighted distribution of operating cash flow and a favorable outlook for sequential earnings growth should reduce our net leverage considerably by year-end.\\nRobert Bryant: 27:10 Thank you, Sean. It was indeed a remarkable quarter. Our teams delivered very strong organic growth and remain focused on driving margin recovery with additional pricing actions underway in every business. I believe that we are laying the groundwork to deliver substantial earnings growth as supply chain constraints wane and end markets recover. 27:32 With that, we'll be pleased to answer any questions. Operator, could you please open the lines for Q&A.\\nOperator: 27:40 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\\nChris Parkinson: 28:09 Great, thank you so much. Robert your team is taking out a lot of cost over the years. I think most investors understand there -- obviously could be further volatility in variable costs. But just -- could you just help us and perhaps Sean as well just how should we be thinking about the broad framework for incremental margins as volumes fully recover especially mobility and if you want to hit on the intermediate and the long term next one or two years that would be very helpful, thank you.\\nRobert Bryant: 28:37 Chris, as we look at our cost structure as you point out, we've made great strides over the past couple of years, especially during the COVID period, where we took a lot of structural cost out of the business. We now feel that we have the cost structure where we want it, and the biggest lever is really going to be the return of volume and leveraging our operating model. So as we see volumes come back and costs abate the drop-through will actually be very attractive for our business.\\nChris Parkinson: 29:13 Got it. And just a quick follow-up just -- relative to all of our own end market assumptions, can you just discuss Axalta’s ability to outperformance respective end markets starting with light vehicle, especially given some of your new business wins? And just perhaps obviously just a structural longevity as the refinish market and key themes of industrial that would also be particularly helpful, just so we can get a hand on the growth, I'll go over the next one or two years. Thank you so much.\\nRobert Bryant: 29:42 Yes, so if we look at things overall, I think we're seeing strong underlying market demand really across the board, within our different businesses and really the primary issue right now are just supply constraints as it is for everyone. I mean within refinish market conditions continue to be supportive, but supply constraints are somewhat limiting our ability to fully serve demand. We do believe that there is recovery coming and we're starting to see that as office occupancy rates tick back up as we highlighted from the low-20% in the U.S. last year or two 42% this quarter and that should lead to more congestion on the roads. So I think our expectation continues to be that we'll see the refinish market recover to pre-pandemic levels and we again remain very bullish on that business. 30:32 And I’ve highlight with the acquisition of U-POL we just have a wonderful opportunity to leverage our sales and distribution channels further by pushing additional products and services through existing sales and distribution channel. So that's also an added plus to the secular direction of the refinish business. Within Industrial, very happy to see the strong sequential volume growth, as well as robust pricing gains that led to the 15% sales increase. If we look at some of the markets within Industrial just in the first quarter Building Product sales were, up 22%; Energy Solutions sales were, up 25%; and General Industrial was, up 11% for the quarter versus the prior year. So with that just highlights is that we're executing extremely well against our strategic plan, which was to accelerate growth in Building Products and Energy Solutions and further build out our platform in Energy Solutions, which we'll be talking more about in the future. 31:38 And with regard to Mobility, Mobility showing strong signs of return as we see sequential year-over-year volume improvement. Obviously, it's still early, but as global production improves and then also the new wins that we had last year and that we continue to generate this year come to fruition. The one area to really highlight there is our sequential price improvement. And again, I would just highlight that in that business -- our business includes only exterior body paint as we define it. But there are elements of the automotive business -- automotive OE business that actually reside within Industrial, where we had 15% price capture, therefore on a like-for-like basis with some of our peers, our actual price capture in Mobility was much higher.\\nChris Parkinson: 32:33 Very helpful color. Thank you so much.\\nOperator: 32:37 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\\nJohn McNulty: 32:44 Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So in the Mobility business you had commented you're about $140 million behind, kind of, where you were pre-COVID. I guess can you help us to understand how much of that is volume driven? And how much of that is price versus raws as you're starting to, kind of, see the acceleration in pricing and starting to catch up, maybe how much of that we can narrow back down even without a recovery in the volumes? I guess, can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 33:14 Yes. John, it's probably 50-50 going back to 2019 levels, we are at 89 million builds. Certainly the controllable right now is catching up on price and clearly you saw that momentum pick up from fourth quarter of the first quarter, you're going to see it again essentially double in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter. But once we get back to sort of that 89 million, 90 million builds, you know, coupled with the fact of pricing traction you're going to see the effect into Chris Parkinson's earlier question, the volumes are camouflage and all the progress we've made from a cost structure perspective, so it's really going to help margins when we get back to those levels.\\nJohn McNulty: 33:53 Got it, got it. No, that makes sense. And then from a capital allocation perspective, so the buyback was kind of off the charts, at least relative to kind of how we were expecting things to play out at least in the quarter. I guess can you speak to how much of that was just the buying opportunity just given how weak the stock had been earlier in the quarter versus how much is around your confidence and the ability to squeeze out more cash as the year goes on to kind of further, kind of, fill up or strengthen the balance sheet and get your kind of, cash flows back on track again? And can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 34:35 The magnitude of the buyout that you saw in the first quarter was really a reflection of how undervalued. We believe our equity was and as we’d always stated we would have a stock repurchase program that would offset dilution, plus an additional few percentage points each year. However, we would remain opportunistic and if we ever really saw a dislocation in the intrinsic value of the company and the equity price that we would step in and step in strongly, and that's what you saw in the first quarter.\\nSean Lannon: 35:07 Yes. And John on your point on cash flow getting back on track. I mean 2020 we did over $440 million, last year we did $455 million. So we've been dropping through cash flow over 50% of EBITDA. So we're happy with the progress we're making, we're confident we're going to delever as long as we don't do anything big on the M&A front. So we're -- again we're being opportunistic given where the share price sits in the first quarter, but we expect the normal seasonality of cash flow build in the back half of 2022.\\nJohn McNulty: 35:37 Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.\\nOperator: 35:42 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\\nMatt Krieger: 35:49 Hi, everyone. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krieger on the line, sitting in for Ghansham. My first question is obviously you delivered results that were ahead of your initial first quarter expectations. But can you talk about some of the key variances relative to your initial guide that drove that? And how those variances have fared as we've moved into early 2Q?\\nSean Lannon: 36:15 Yes. I mean volume was probably the bright spot on the light vehicle side, we had initially assumed 17 million global builds, IHS came in closer to 19.5 million builds and certainly, we benefited from outperforming the actual overall market. We saw volume improvement also within the performance side of the business and then the other bright spot is clearly pricing we were initially expecting around 7% price, we got upwards of 9%, but that has actually offset the impacts that we saw with Russia and the China dynamics, as well as the fact that we saw incrementally about $20 million in variable logistics and variable raw material costs.\\nRobert Bryant: 37:00 Yes, I would just add to what Sean said Matt to the second part of your question regarding April conditions. I think when you look at what we accomplished in the first quarter, it's really impressive, I mean we would have had a blow out quarter had we not had the incremental headwinds and approximately $22 million more in earnings. And I think that's worth noting, but thus far in April top line sales conditions really appear to be similar to what we've seen on -- in the first quarter. And on the cost side, we're seeing oil trade slightly better than our guidance outlook, but the price does remain pretty volatile. So that could be the other variable as we think about the second quarter. We're also closely monitoring the developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation in China, but really at this time April hasn't given us much of a reason to move guidance up or down at this point.\\nMatt Krieger: 37:56 Great. That's definitely helpful. And then just focusing on the bottom line here, can you provide some added detail on what a realistic timeline for price cost parity across your various business units might look like? And then expanding on that, what level of pricing do we need to see across your portfolio to offset the level of inflation that you're currently experiencing in the high '20s range? Is that mid-teens pricing, high teens pricing, 20% plus pricing flow through. Give us a sense of what we should be looking for from that perspective?\\nSean Lannon: 38:32 So if we hit average oil and there is not a perfect correlation with all the raw material baskets, but if average oil for 2022 is up around $115 per barrel, we're going to need to get almost 10% price to offset exiting 2021, we had roughly at $70 million gap including logistics. We had called out roughly $50 million just raw materials, but we're solving for the full cost stack for the full-year.\\nMatt Krieger: 39:01 Great. That's helpful, thanks.\\nOperator: 39:07 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\\nPJ Juvekar: 39:15 Yes. Hi, good morning, you know, question on your industrial business, you got really good pricing there, volumes were a bit soft due to supply chain issues. So it seems like the underlying demand was still strong, but you had some -- the supply chain issues. But the question on this underlying demand with Europe slowing down with the war and China shut downs recently with COVID, how do you see the underlying demand perform for rest of the year?\\nRobert Bryant: 39:46 I think is -- there is a question of underlying demand and then there's a question of what we're able to supply. And just given the mix of raw materials, as well as the overall volume of the Industrial business, that's really the inhibitor, PJ. But if you look at the demand profile of the business, demand was exceptionally strong in North America in particular and we’d again we talk about each one of our unique businesses. We did see Building products, as well as energy solutions grow quite strongly and even Industrial -- general industrial being up being up 11%. Could we see some softness in particular in the general industrial business in Europe, just given some of the pressures there? 40:36 Yes, we could see some softness there, I think it's too early to really tell, but I think the other -- each one of the regions is stronger and each one of the individual industrial segments. So they do kind of balance each other out somewhat. And it's also just important to remember that it's a very highly fragmented customer base, so we are able to increase price. And it does also give us some insulation from some of those macro trends.\\nPJ Juvekar: 41:06 Great, thank you. And can you talk about your battery coatings products for EVs at the PAT level? And what's in the pipeline there? And what would you say your market share is in that business?\\nRobert Bryant: 41:18 Let highlight that in particular, I know you're asking about batteries. But we're really one of the top companies in the world when it comes to electric motors in our Energy Solutions business or Energy Solutions Coatings for which we've won multiple Technology Awards they're used in electric motors and vehicles, industrial applications, wind turbines, transmission towers, electrical conduits, but also fuel storage containers, battery trays, closures and covers. And so we have now leveraged our Energy Solutions business to grow into battery cells, battery modules and battery packs. 41:58 Now that being said, we see a much larger opportunity in the global electrification market and we'll be talking about that more in the future. And in terms of market share at this point, it's a nascent, but a quickly growing market share.\\nPJ Juvekar: 42:18 Thank you.\\nOperator: 42:22 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\\nAlex Yefremov: 42:30 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert you mentioned some new wins in Mobility, could you discuss how are you pricing those wins? Are they being done at margins sort of similar to what we see today in the segment? Or some normalized level of how you make sure that there is good return in capital for those new deals?\\nRobert Bryant: 42:51 Sure, at a variable contribution level we've been pricing all of our new business at what we have historically deemed to be attractive levels, and I would say that are reflective of current market conditions. And in particular the business that we have won in China has been at very attractive margins.\\nSean Lannon: 43:12 And Alex just on return on invested capital, I mean, we don't necessarily need to invest additional assets, I mean, we're essentially filling up our plants with the volume. So as far as the incrementals on those, they're also very attractive.\\nRobert Bryant: 43:26 I mean that really just your question, I think the increasing sales in Mobility has really been through our technology, our customer intimacy and relationships and frankly our service. And our team in Mobility in particular in Asia has just been doing an outstanding job.\\nAlex Yefremov: 43:46 Thank you, very helpful. Turning to Refinish it sounds like your customers continue to pay shortages of materials and personnel. Do you have any insight weather these issues are getting better not getting better? Or and what could be the pace of improvement here for the rest of the year?\\nRobert Bryant: 44:12 It does still remain an issue for body shops in particular in the U.S., anecdotally we have heard over the last month that it has been getting better, but again I would characterize that is anecdotal as opposed to data driven.\\nAlex Yefremov: 44:29 Got it. Thanks a lot.\\nOperator: 44:34 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nKevin McCarthy: 44:41 Yes, good morning, Robert in your prepared remarks, you referenced company stronger share position and you went on to allude to penetration in the economy segment of Refinish and it sounds like you picked up some share in Mobility. Is there a way to size how much volume uplift you might be enjoying in those businesses or perhaps other businesses where you've gained share relative to underlying market growth?\\nRobert Bryant: 45:12 Well, I think we take a look at volume in particular and if we look at volume in the first quarter at least, our volume growth was the strongest in Refinish in particular in North America and Latin America followed by commercial vehicle in EMEA and Latin America. And then industrial in North America and then as we've highlighted our light vehicle business in China. And our penetration, I think would have been even greater of we have had sufficient raw materials. If you think about it, the lack of raw materials is kind of left us with a current backlog in Refinish and Industrial of approximately $50 million, which is about 4% of Q1 sales. So we actually had even more demand and potentially could have had even more share, if we have been able to get our hands on those raw materials. 46:09 So I think the team is doing a great job, not only in the Mobility business, but also in the Industrial business and in Refinish. And in Refinish, as we've highlighted the mainstream in the economy segments have been areas of focus for us and we've made in particular good inroads there in Latin America with a new business model, as well as with China and U-POL only allows us to further leverage that position, because most of U-POL sales and distribution network goes to more mainstream and economy sites, which has allowed us from a cross-selling perspective to more deeply penetrate with our Refinish products, as well as getting our U-POL products into more of our distribution, as well as some of our larger body shops in Europe and in the US.\\nKevin McCarthy: 47:05 And then secondly, if I may, can you comment on what you saw in China in the first quarter in both here in auto and industrial businesses? And what was the trajectory as COVID re-surged in March into early April, curious as to your thoughts on the underlying economy there?\\nRobert Bryant: 47:30 I think when you look again at underlying demand in China, demand there has remained really strong. The lockdowns however have made it more challenging to service our customers, but our team there has been doing a great job keeping customers running, even if it's meant living at their sites, which they've voluntarily been doing. So I think we feel really good about what's going on there. On the Mobility side, again, we’ve made some changes from an organizational perspective over the last 18-months, that have really helped us more deeply penetrate the market in particular with Chinese domestics, we've had a pretty significant amount of growth in China. 48:14 And then on the Industrial side, we've also brought in new talent over the past year with very specific domain expertise in the industrial markets that are the largest and play best with our technology portfolio in China and they've also made really, really good inroads. Now in terms of the financial impact as we look at the quarter the COVID-19 lockdowns in China we saw really kind of create a relatively modest headwind in Q1. We expect it to be a little bit more material in Q2 with the shutdowns, so the April results we expect to be most impacted as the lockdowns are kind of in full swing in Shanghai. But we expect the business should start to normalize in May, unless we see COVID spread to other areas and then our guidance assumption is kind of, if there is a full return to normal operations in June. If the lockdowns are lifted. So again all of that depends on the trajectory of where we go from here. Again as a reminder, China is about 10% of our annual sales and we've assumed about a 1.5 month impact in the second quarter.\\nKevin McCarthy: 49:34 That's really helpful. Thank you, Robert.\\nOperator: 49:40 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nVincent Andrews: 49:47 Thank you and good morning everyone. Just wanted to get a little more insight into the 35% to 40% of the index pricing, you have now, which is up from prior indication. Where are you looking to get that figure? And what is it that's driving those customers onto those contracts versus the ones that are staying often. Is it new folks that are coming in where you have new wins? Or is it you're converting existing customers or both. And as a follow-up to that, just when we get to a period of deflation, which hopefully eventually we will get to presumably those contracts will automatically reset on some timeframe, but then you'll be looking to hold on to price in the balance of the business. Maybe just wanted to sort of get some insight into that interplay?\\nRobert Bryant: 50:39 The optimal level of -- I’d say the optimal level of index contracts is difficult to say, it's really more of a customer preference. There are some customers that prefer to have an index contracts in place, it just makes the amount of time that we as well as our customers spend on price negotiations, run a lot more smoothly every, every customer is different and every purchasing organization within each OEM is different, some prefer not to have an index contracts and just to have price negotiations verbally. So it's really more a function of what our customer preferences are. 51:19 Most of the contracts on average have about a six-month adjustment. So for example, July 1st we'll see an adjustment to the majority of the index contracts that will start to see that flow through at the beginning of the third quarter. And then likewise, if you were to see raw material prices come down, you would see those prices come down six months later. I think the important element to emphasize there is the through cycle profitability and so as we've structured these arrangements with our customers, we have tried to put them through the mid-point of the cycle on attractive level of profitability for us, which we think we've achieved in terms of how we've structured those contract. And in particular, you know, versus the amount of value that we actually create for our OEM customers, which as you know is quite substantial.\\nVincent Andrews: 52:13 And then maybe just a follow-up on U-POL, I think you've had the business since September and obviously it's been a tricky time with raw materials and pricing. Have they been able to be as nimble as you've wanted them to be? Or if you had to come in with best practices or just how is pricing going with the acquisition?\\nSean Lannon: 52:29 Yes. So, I mean as far as the integration activities are going very well, I mean we're essentially seven months into the journey right now. On the cost side, we only had roughly $10 million of synergies, we're well on track. We have targeted 12 to 18-months on that front. So we're in good shape on the cost side. As far as the commercial synergies and Robert covered this a bit in his prepared remarks but we're making really good progress as far as integrating their commercial teams and really driving those efforts and actually seeing the progress. The expectation pre-all the additional pricing we are expecting to do high-teens as far as growth rates and slightly higher than that from an EBITDA perspective. With the additional pricing, we expect to be north of that, but I would characterize U-POL very similar to the overall Refinish with good pricing hour and we’ll make good progress on that front.\\nVincent Andrews: 53:23 Great, thank you very much.\\nOperator: 53:27 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Sison: 53:33 Hey guys, good morning. In terms of mobility you -- at the 80.6 million auto build outlook that you have for ’22, is there good improvement in the second half? Is pricing catches up? Or are we still sort of at this breakeven point given you gave us an outlook for the auto build?\\nSean Lannon: 53:54 Yes, we will be making steady progress as we work through the year. We're expecting volumes to continue to pick up sequentially, coupled with the fact that pricing will start to outpace that the COGS inflation rates.\\nMike Sison: 54:11 Got it. And then yes, no just as a quick follow-up on the business, there's not a lot of businesses I don't think that are kind of losing money in Coatings and I think that's probably for everybody. But is this a good business for Axalta longer term given how cyclical it's been. I understand it's been kind of weird unprecedented times, but when you think about where you could redeploy potentially and I know timing is a bad? Is this something that you should hold onto or maybe the vast at some point and then invest in things in Performance Coatings, which is held up a lot better?\\nRobert Bryant: 54:50 I think to answer your question, we have to look at kind of the moment in history that we are right now, which is fairly, fairly unprecedented. I think if you take COVID and then on top of COVID, you ask -- you add massive cost inflation and then you add a semiconductor shortage and then on top of that, you add supply chain issues. It does create a rather unique point in history that we would certainly hope would never be repeated. As we think about the business over the longer term again, we think that over the next five years once those conditions ameliorate, we are going to see secular demand that is going to make this business an extremely strong performer within our portfolio. The lack of inventory at OEMs at dealer life, the need of car rental companies to replenish their fleets, there's just a tremendous amount of secular demand. 55:51 In addition to the continued conversion from Ice vehicles to electric vehicles where we have additional content per vehicle that will also be an impetus and is the business changes in works, we also have some additional technologies, as well as some additional areas of market focus that we think are going to even improve potentially the margin profile of the business to that of a higher level than sort of the 2016, 2017 period. So again, as far as Light Vehicle we do remain positive on that business. It's just a tough point in time when you have this many exogenous variables go against you.\\nSean Lannon: 56:32 And Mike, I just -- I did want to call out one point, because I think some folks lose sight of this, light vehicle is still EBITDA positive. EBIT has been impacted by all the depreciation and amortization from the carve-out from DuPont back in ’13, but it's still is generating cash and I did want to highlight that point.\\nMike Sison: 56:51 Got it. Thank you.\\nOperator: 56:55 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Leithead: 57:02 Great, thanks, good morning guys. Just one from me, I wanted to circle back to John's earlier question on the buyback. Robert, you obviously talked about finding great value in your equity price in 1Q. And when I just look at your current share price, it's maybe I don't know 10-ish percent below your average acquired price in 1Q? So should we expect healthy buybacks to continue into 2Q here?\\nSean Lannon: 57:26 So we're not providing discrete guidance on that. I think we're going to remain opportunistic, we also are keeping an eye on M&A activities, as well as deleveraging over time. But it's certainly on the agenda that continue to look at.\\nMike Leithead: 57:44 I guess maybe a different way to come at it we have your average 1Q share diluted count. What did the quarter end that, I'm just trying to back into your 2Q shares outstanding guidance there? Thanks.\\nRobert Bryant: 57:59 So we acquired 6.4 million shares, we got roughly a $4 million diluted average benefit in the first quarter and we're expecting Q2 guide to be at $2.22. I'm not sure if I answered your question precisely, there.\\nMike Leithead: 58:17 No, I think that's helpful. We can follow-up offline. Thank you.\\nOperator: 58:22 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\\nLucas Beaumont: Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. I just wanted to go back to the contract re-pricing in Light Vehicle if we could. So could you tell us sort of roughly how much of your contracts have sort of been repriced already today? And how much you expect to be re-priced by the end of the year, please?\\nRobert Bryant: 58:46 The way to think about that is that the contracts vary and linked between three and four years. So in any given year there is about 25% to 33% of the contracts that are coming up for quote or for rebidding. So you have an built-in price adjuster of about a quarter of the business at least kind of every year as business is rebid and requited. The other element to keep in mind is that the color palette of all so as you might have a given vehicle platform is there is a color change? Of course, you'll be repricing those colors at current economics.\\nLucas Beaumont: 59:29 Great, thanks. And then, so just thinking about if mobility markets going to fail to improve or end up remaining like a strain for a number of additional quarters. Do you guys have any like contingency plans, where you would think about taking any temporary or sort of permanent cost actions. I guess how meaningful could that be? Or it gives you more, you would just wait it out until we sort of get through it? Thanks.\\nSean Lannon: 59:58 So at this point, you know, over the last two years, we've done a fair amount of reductions both structural, as well as holding on the -- some of the temporary savings. So unless we saw a significant demand destruction, I think we're in a pretty good place, right now it's just to focus on price. And I think what you're going to see in the second quarter is a nice uptick and price realization to continue to help our margins.\\nOperator: 60:28 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

My name is Alex and I will be coordinating the call today.  00:24 I will now hand over to your host Nikki Sparley, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Nikki.\\nNikki Sparley: 00:31Thank you, Alex. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. As a reminder, some things that will be said this morning contain forward-looking statements. They are based on management's assumptions which may or may not occur. For a complete list of cautionary statements, refer to the language at the end of our press release. We expect to file our 10-Q later today. As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call. Please note, these calls are designed for the financial community. If you are an investor and have additional questions after the call, please contact me directly at (503) 721-2530. News media may contact David Roy at (503) 610-7157. 01:22 Speaking this morning are David Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Burkhartsmeyer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David and Frank have prepared remarks and then will be available along with other members of our executive team to answer your questions. 01:39 With that, I will turn it over to David.\\nDavid Anderson: 01:41 Thanks, Nikki. And good morning, everybody and welcome. We started off the year strong and in line with our expectations. Our financial results were solid and we continue to make progress on all key objectives. We reported net income today of $1.80 per share in the first quarter compared to net income of $1.94 per share for the same period last year. 02:01 Results for 2021 include a $0.09 per share benefit related to severe cold weather event in February last year. Setting that aside, financial results in 2022 were driven by new rates in Washington and customer growth, as well as continued growth in expenses as we invest in our natural gas utility system. 02:21 We also see positive momentum in our local Portland Metro area economy, the strong labor market helped to drive unemployment down to near historic lows. Unemployment rates in Oregon declined to 3.8% in March 2022, compared to 6.1% a year ago. Single-family housing activity remains robust. The average sales price of a home was up over 10% for the first quarter of March 2022 compared to last year. Single-family permits issued were up almost 3% in Oregon through February 2022, compared to the prior period. Construction and development remained robust in our region. 02:59 We continue to see a healthy pipeline of conversions to natural gas in single-family homes. In the last 12 months, 2,200 customers have converted in our service territory. These conversions, along with new construction translated into nearly 11,000 customers connected to our gas system during the last 12 months. That equates to a growth rate of about 1.4%. 03:21 Our water and wastewater utilities also continue to grow. Strong residential housing construction primarily in Idaho and Texas translated into a 3.1% organic customer growth rate over the last 12 months ended March 31. The combination of this organic growth and acquisitions resulted in a 27% increase in our water utility connections. 03:43 Turning to our decarbonization activities. We continue to make progress under the landmark Oregon Senate Bill 98 legislation which supports renewable energy procurement and investment by natural gas utilities. In January this year, Northwest Natural reached an important milestone as the first RNG facility with Tyson Foods and BioCarbN began operations. Northwest Natural is the first local gas distribution utility in the Continental United States to invest in and own an RNG facility on behalf of all of its sales customers as we work to decarbonize our gas portfolio. 04:21 Construction of our second facility has begun with commission slated for early 2023. To date, we signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG on behalf of our customers, totaling about 3% of Northwest Natural's current annual sales volume in Oregon. I am very proud of the progress we've made in less than two years. To put that into perspective, today wind and solar account for about 12% of our nation's electric supply, after decades of investment. In March we also interconnected an RNG facility in Eugene, Oregon to our system. We're excited to keep flowing renewables through our own pipeline system here in Oregon. 05:01 Reflecting our dedication to decarbonization, Northwest Natural was recently made an environmental champion among 140 of the largest utilities in a national study by Escalent. I'm proud of our customers' recognition of our dedication and leadership in this area and thank them greatly. 05:18 With that, let me turn it over to Frank to cover the financials of the quarter.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 05:21 Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing the highlights of the first quarter of 2022 results and conclude with guidance for the year. I'll describe the earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. 05:36 As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of the revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months. 05:45 For the quarter, we reported net income of $56.2 million or $1.80 per share compared to net income of $59.5 million or $1.94 for the same period in 2021, a decline of $0.14 per share. The decrease in net income largely reflects the $2.8 million or $0.09 per share benefit of the February 2021 cold weather event. The gas utility posted a $0.01 per share increase in earnings, while results from our other businesses declined $0.15 per share. 06:16 Higher earnings at the gas utility were primarily related to new rates in Washington, customer growth and an improvement in the results from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as the prior year included the effect of purchasing higher-priced gas during the February weather event. As a result of these factors, utility margin increased $3.7 million. 06:36 Utility O&M increased $3.5 million, reflecting higher levels of expense from payroll, contractor and professional services and IT upgrades. Utility depreciation and general taxes increased $900,000 due to higher property, plant and equipment as we continue to invest in our system. Other income increased $1.9 million, driven by lower pension costs. Net income from our other businesses decreased $4.7 million as the prior period benefited from higher asset management revenues related to the cold weather event. 07:08 For 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $141 million, an increase of $4 million compared to last year. We invested $70 million into the business, most of which was for gas utility and capital expenditures. On April 1, we completed an equity offering and received approximately $140 million of proceeds to support our growing businesses. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity. 07:34 Moving on to financial guidance. The company reaffirmed 2022 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations. We continue to target our long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6%. 08:01 With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.\\nDavid Anderson: 08:04 Thanks, Frank. We continue to progress and execute on our business strategy. Our focus is maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated gas utilities and positioning our business for incremental long-term growth by investment in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas business. 08:21 In addition to moving our gas utility towards a renewable future, last year we also launched a competitive renewable natural gas strategy. We're committed to leading in the energy transition and providing renewable natural gas to the utility, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors. We're focused on providing cost-effective solutions to help these sectors decarbonize, while existing waste streams and renewable energy sources were using the existing waste streams and renewable energy sources. 08:51 As you know, we've already taken our first steps with the 20-year RNG supply agreement and a total of $50 million committed investment in two RNG facilities. Construction has begun on both of those facilities and we expect them to be placed into service in early 2023. At the end of January, Mike Kotick joined our team to lead our competitive RNG efforts. In just a few short months, Mike has hired additional members to the RNG team who comes with significant RNG experience. The team is fully engaged, pursuing incremental opportunities and putting the final touches on the business plan. We'll share more details on that in the coming months. 09:28 Turning to our water and wastewater utility businesses. As previously mentioned, in December 2021 we signed our largest acquisition to date to acquire Far West Water and wastewater utilities in Yuma, Arizona, a very fast-growing region which currently serves approximately 25,000 customers. We've met with all the Arizona utility commissioners and look forward to working closely with them in SAP. In March, we submitted the application for approval of the transaction to the Arizona Commission. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year and it to be accretive to earnings per share after its first full year of operations. 10:05 In the first quarter, we also announced additional agreements to acquire two water utilities near our existing systems in Texas. We remain excited about the investment potential for this business and we look forward to more announcements soon. And finally, this morning I'm proud that Northwest Natural Holdings being named one of 2022's World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. This reflects our longstanding commitment to leadership and business integrity through best-in-class ethics, compliance and governance practices. It is the first year Northwest Natural Holdings has been recognized and is one of only nine honorees in the energy and utilities industry. In all, 136 honorees were recognized spanning 22 countries and 45 industries. I view good governance is the backbone of a strong company and we'll continue to focus on this going forward. 10:57 In conclusion, your company is financially strong, complete and I'm very pleased with the opportunities we have across all businesses. So with that, thank you for joining us this morning. And Alex, we'll open it up for questions if anybody has them.\\nOperator: 11:13 Thank you.  Our first question for today comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America.\\nDavid Anderson: 11:32 Good morning.\\nKody Clark: Hey, good morning, David and Frank. This is Kody Clark on for Julien. Thanks for the time. So first, curious if you can share more on what you're seeing with the current inflationary backdrop? And specifically, how much is expected as it relates to the IT program for '22 versus some other pressures that we've seen with the backdrop?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 11:57 Hello, good morning, Kody, it's Frank. Yes, I wouldn't -- I don't want to describe the O&M change that you're seeing as inflationary. It's really an effort that we're making right now. A lot of that impact is coming from some investments that we're having to make in IT. And part of that is taking on some cloud arrangements which flows through O&M now. That's a fair piece of that. The rest of it is salary and benefits are up. I wouldn't call that inflationary. We didn't see a huge, say, extraordinary change in our salary and benefits year-over-year. And then we also have a little bit more business development. We're doing RNG now, it's in a competitive market as well as the water business. 12:39 So, you kind of have those three things and then just your ordinary -- the business is growing. This is why we filed the rate case or a big part of it year-over-year. Just we knew this growth was coming. I will say though that the first quarter shows a bigger change, if you looked at a percentage, probably almost double what we would expect for the full year. So we expect O&M to grow this year. Nothing unusual there. But in the first quarter, there's a little bit of a timing impact that makes the first quarter versus the first quarter last year look a bit higher. So that will normalize as the year plays out.\\nKody Clark: 13:13 Understood. Got it. And on regulated RNG, you're at 3% of volumes. But as we think about the caps in '25 and beyond, how should we be thinking about your ability to rebate investments versus just offtake? So what's the difference in customer costs, if any? And any data points or color there that you can point to would be helpful.\\nDavid Anderson: 13:37 Yes. Kody, I think the number one thing that you -- that everybody should understand is, we're going to do all we can to decarbonize as much of our product as we can under Senate Bill 98 and that will be through -- it could be through investments or it could be through just direct purchases, whatever is in the best interest of our customers. And right now, we've done that and we've done it through a rate base investment with the Tyson opportunity that I referenced in my prepared remarks and then we've also got purchase agreements. 14:04 So I expect more coming down as we continue to progress and hopefully, it reaches close to the limit of Senate Bill 98 as quickly as we possibly can. So it's a little hard right now to say X amount will come from rate base, X amount will come from purchases. Again, we'll do what is in the best interest of our customers, which I believe going forward will be a combination of both.\\nKody Clark: 14:29 Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze it in on competitive RNG. And you mentioned potentially getting some additional announcements here. But wondering if there's any timing that you can point to? Is it a matter of getting those first projects under your belt and in service in early 2023 before committing to anything incremental or could we see some additional announcements sooner?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 14:55 Yes. We're in the early stages, as we just mentioned. I'm really pleased with the progress that Mike has made with his team of getting the team established. There's already incremental opportunities that we're looking at and it's one of the reasons when we came out with the strategy late last year that we raised our earnings growth guidance from the 3% to 5% through 4% to 6% because we do see additional opportunities here that will help the company grow faster than it would without that. 15:21 So more details to come in the coming months but you're right, Kody, I think we need to do some more transactions and then we'll be a little bit more descriptive when those transactions happen. And some of those can be development, some of them could be contract purchases and we market them, there's various options that Mike is working through with the team right now.\\nKody Clark: 15:41 Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks so much for the time, and good luck.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 15:45 You bet. Thank you.\\nOperator: 15:49 Thank you.  Our next question for today comes from Selman Akyol from Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nSelman Akyol: 16:02 Thank you. Good morning. Just staying with renewables. Was there any update on hydrogen? I mean, we're just starting to hear more about it. So I was just curious from what you're seeing on your side.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 16:12 Nothing new update on our front. Nikki, why don't you kind of give an indication of what we're working on?\\nNikki Sparley: 16:18 Sure. We have a couple of efforts that are active right now. One of them is continuation of our work with the Eugene Electric Utility to develop a hydrogen blending project in Eugene, where we're at there is we have an engineer and an equipment consultants working on finishing the project plan. We also hired a consultant to do a system audit. It's a readiness audit in that site and where we're going to be blending in that area that helps us understand hydrogen readiness for all our pipes and components and meters. 16:55 And we expect that work to be done in July and then we'll be wrapping on that into a potential filing under Senate Bill 98 here in Oregon, along with securing potentially other funding from a clean energy fund in the United States. The other thing that we're doing is continuing our hydrogen blend cap at our Sherwood facility in Oregon. We've been blending about 5% hydrogen in a section of that facility for about 1.5 years, testing end-use applications, furnaces, water heaters, fireplaces. 17:35 Our 2022 goals are to step up that blend to a 24/7 operation with a ramp-up at a 15% blend and 5% increment through this year, of course, subject to performance, both in our system and on the end-use equipment. And we're looking at other opportunities with hydrogen in our area and nationally partnering with other groups. The application that I mentioned for the Eugene project with the -- under that Senate Bill 98, that is legislation that was passed several years ago in Oregon that allows natural gas utilities to apply for spending on projects that reduce emissions that would otherwise not be cost-effective. 18:24 So it's an avenue that we have to work collectively with the EWEB Electric Utility. And I'm sorry, it's SD844, I said 98, I apologize, that's our RNG legislation. But a lot of activity and you're right, we're hearing a lot of interest in hydrogen and we're working hard on it ourselves.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 18:47 Yes, Selman, I mean, we're really focused on RNG and hydrogen. They're both going to be the solutions for the industry and I would argue for the greater economy as a whole. So hopefully, more to come on that front but we're all in on both.\\nSelman Akyol: 19:02 Got it and very helpful. Just pivoting over to water. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there and maybe your pipeline and just how pricing is going or is there upward pressure on the systems that you're seeing in terms of pricing or is it sort of in line with what you've been doing?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 19:21 Yes. I'm really pleased with the success we've had today in the last year or so. Justin, why don't you -- Justin is our President of the Water Company and let me get him to address it.\\nJustin Palfreyman: 19:31 Yeah. Good morning, Salman. We continue to see a robust set of opportunities in pipeline in the water space. It is competitive and there are a number of players out there that are also pursuing opportunities. That competition varies a little bit depending on the specific market. But we are pleased with the progress we've been making and we see a fairly robust pipeline of opportunities going forward. We will continue to tuck-in smaller acquisitions around our existing service territories and we're working hard on investing in the existing utilities that we own. We actually just completed a couple of rate cases this last quarter with new rates in effect May 1 in both -- one of our Oregon subsidiaries and one of our Washington subsidiaries. 20:20 So things are going well there. I believe that we'll continue to see a robust set of opportunities and acquisitions going forward.\\nSelman Akyol: 20:29 All right, thank you very much.\\nDavid Anderson: 20:32 Thank you, Salman.\\nOperator: 20:35 Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So I will hand back to David Anderson for any closing remarks.\\nDavid Anderson: 20:43 Thank you, Alex. And thank you guys for joining us and for those of you that will be at the AGA event here in a couple of weeks, we'd love to see you, give Nikki a call and we'll see if we can set up time. With that, have a great day, everybody. Thank you.\\nOperator: 20:59 Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

Michael?\\nMichael Nauman: 01:31 Thank you, Ann. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we released our fiscal twenty twenty two first quarter financial results, which showed strong sales growth and profitability. Even in this challenging environment caused by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 virus and the associated inflation and logistical challenges, the Brady team once again performed quite well. I'm proud of how the team was able to navigate this challenging economic environment and deliver for both our customers and our shareholders. 02:08 This quarter, we grew sales by a very healthy sixteen percent and we increased earnings per share by four point seven percent. If you exclude the impact of amortization, then our EPS was up even more significantly at nine point one percent. In addition to this solid revenue and earnings growth, we have a rock solid balance sheet. This quarter we returned more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, and we are still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 02:41 In our WPS business, sales were down by seven point eight percent. This sales reduction was almost exclusively the result of very challenging comparables. Last year, our WPS team did an excellent job of providing COVID-related products to our customers. The sale of these products, which included social distance signage and personal protective equipment has since waned, thus resulting in challenging comparables. The best way to look at our WPS business is to compare sales to the pre-COVID period of fiscal twenty twenty, which would show that our current sales levels exceeded those historic pre-COVID levels. 03:24 In our Identification Solutions business, we continue to post excellent results, with sales growth of twenty five point four percent and segment profit growth of twenty one point two percent. And if you exclude the impact of amortization expense, segment profit would have been up a robust twenty six point four percent. Our Identification Solutions business is a very strong franchise and continues to perform extremely well. As we look ahead, our priorities are the first to drive organic sales growth and ensure we are serving our customers extremely well during this period of challenging logistics. Second, it is to take the necessary cost and pricing actions to offset the impacts of this inflationary environment and return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels. Third, is to integrate our recent acquisitions. And finally, to deploy our capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 04:28 In our ID Solutions business, we're embracing these priorities by increasing our investments in R&D, including the incremental R&D necessary to fully realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions. We are certainly seeing benefits from our historical R&D focus as we're launching new products at an increasing rate and we're continuing to distance ourselves from our competitors, who neither have the scale nor financial wherewithal to invest as heavily in R&D. 04:57 We're also improving our online presence by upgrading our websites and investing more in digital marketing talent all while expanding our sales force and expanding geographically into underserved markets. We're driving significant automation enhancements within our factories and distribution centers, which in a period marked by scarcity of labor and rising costs, this continuous push to drive automation is critical. 05:24 Our strong new product line-up, investments to drive sales and our positive momentum in driving efficiencies give us confidence that our ID Solutions business will continue to generate strong organic sales growth with very healthy margins in fiscal twenty twenty two and beyond. 05:43 In our Workplace Safety business, we are capitalizing on our common web platform by using our much stronger market intelligence to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We've increased our investments to new product development and the pace of new product launches in an effort to increase the percentage of proprietary high value products sold to our customers, which will have a positive impact on our profit margins. 06:08 And we're intensely increasing our advertising spend and our headcount in certain businesses that have lagged in an effort to drive future revenues. These investments resulted in reduced segment profit this quarter, but will result in increased revenues as we progressed throughout the fiscal year. 06:27 Our Workplace Safety business is headed in the right direction. And I'm confident that the changes we've been implementing and the investments we've been making will help drive long-term sales and profit growth. While we're investing in organic sales, we're also working to streamline our SG&A cost structure, so that we can fund our sales growth initiatives while still driving down SG&A expense and we're focused on becoming a more efficient manufacturer by automating wherever we can. 06:57 In addition to our focus on driving organic sales growth and becoming a more efficient organization, we are also actively integrating the three acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter last year, which includes building out our industrial track and trace solution set. Much of the increased R&D that you see relates to the investments necessary to build out a comprehensive solution that will help move us into faster growing end markets and accelerate sales growth for years to come. 07:25 I'm confident we'll continue to see revenue growth in future quarters. However, we're seeing inflationary pressures across many different cost categories, from wages to freight to raw materials and we've had challenges securing supply of certain products, including chips and selected products for our supply chain originates in Asia. 07:47 In general, we've been overcoming these shortages, but it has resulted in increased freight charges as we've used air freight more than we have in the past. Even with these inflationary pressures, our gross profit margin was still an enviable forty eight point two percent, which was right in line with the forty eight point two percent experience in the fourth quarter of last year. But our cost increases have neither been large enough nor fast enough to fully keep up with rising costs, resulting in our gross margins being down around seventy basis points and year-over-year basis. 08:27 As such, we're putting through additional price increases across many of our product lines to try to catch up with the rapidly increasing costs. We believe that these gross margin challenges are temporary and that in the near term, we will return to our historical gross margin levels of close to fifty percent. Even with this challenging logistical environment, Brady is well-positioned as we look to the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. I'm confident in our ability to deliver results to our customers, our employees, and of course, our shareholders. 09:01 I'll now turn the call over to Aaron to give a little more detail on our financial results. Then I'll return to provide specific commentary about our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses. Aaron?\\nAaron James Pearce: 09:14 Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll start the financial review on slide number three. Sales in the first quarter were three hundred and twenty one point five million dollars, which was an increase of sixteen percent when compared to the same quarter last year and GAAP pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent to forty four point seven million dollars. 09:37 Impacting earnings this quarter was a significant increase in amortization expense from the acquisitions completed at the end of last year. If you exclude amortization expense from all periods presented, and our pre-tax earnings would have increased by eleven point three percent to forty eight point five million dollars. 09:57 GAAP diluted EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars, which was an increase of four point seven percent over last year's first quarter. And if you exclude amortization expense, then EPS would have increased by nine point one percent to zero point seventy two dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty six dollars in the first quarter of last year. So, financially, Q1 was another strong quarter even with the logistical challenges and the inflationary pressures that Michael just mentioned. 10:27 Moving to slide number four, you will find our quarterly sales trends. Our sixteen percent sales increase consisted of organic sales growth of seven percent, an increase from acquisitions of eight point three percent, and an increase from foreign currency translation of zero point seven percent. 10:44 Organic sales growth in our ID Solutions business was a robust thirteen point two percent in Q1. Our Workplace Safety business benefited from strong COVID-related product sales in last year's first quarter thus creating tough comparables. As a result of these tough comparables, we saw a decline in WPS organic sales of eight point six percent this quarter. 11:07 If we compare our sales levels to the pre-pandemic period, which for us would be the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty, you'll see that our total sales are up a full twelve percent over pre-pandemic levels. And if you compare sales by division, you'll see that Identification Solutions is fifteen point six percent above pre-pandemic levels and Workplace Safety is one point two percent above pre-pandemic levels. 11:35 This strong performance not only against last year, but also against the pre-pandemic period is a direct result of the investments that we've been making and the strong sales momentum that we developed just before the pandemic hit. 11:47 Turning to slide number five, you'll see our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was forty eight point two percent this quarter compared to forty eight point nine percent in the first quarter of last year. As Michael mentioned, we're seeing inflationary pressures and we're finding it difficult to fill open manufacturing roles. But we're automating wherever we can, we're driving efficiencies at a strong pace and we're putting it through targeted price increases. 12:14 On slide number six, you will find our SG&A expense trending. SG&A was ninety six point seven million dollars this quarter compared to eighty three million dollars in the first quarter of last year. SG&A was heavily impacted by a full quarter of expense from the three acquisitions completed near the end of last year along with the increase in amortization expense that I just mentioned. 12:36 Amortization expense was one point four million dollars in the first quarter of last year and was three point eight million dollars in the first quarter of this year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was thirty point one percent this quarter compared to thirty point zero percent in the first quarter of last year. So, effectively, right in line with the prior year. However, if you exclude amortization expense from both the current year and the prior year, then SG&A would have declined from twenty nine point five percent of sales last year to twenty eight point nine percent of sales this year. 13:11 Slide number seven is the trending of our investments in research and development. This quarter, we invested thirteen point nine million dollars in R&D. We're committed to increasing our R&D investments as we continue to see opportunities for incremental R&D within our core business and specifically in building out a comprehensive industrial track and trace platform that encompasses our printers, high quality materials, RFID scanners, and barcode scanners. These investments in R&D are critical to help propel Brady's long-term sales growth and protect our gross profit margins. 13:45 Slide number eight illustrates our pre-tax income trends. Pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent on a GAAP basis and increased eleven point three percent, if you exclude amortization expense from all periods. 13:59 Slide number nine illustrates our after-tax income and EPS trends. As I mentioned, our GAAP EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty four dollars in last year's first quarter, an increase of four point seven percent. And if you exclude the after-tax impact of amortization, our EPS would have increased by an even stronger nine point one percent. 14:21 On slide number ten, you'll find a summary of our cash generation. We generated twenty seven point five million dollars of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow was sixteen point two million dollars this quarter. Our underlying cash flow was strong, but we intentionally invested in both inventories as well as capital expenditures. This quarter, we purchased two previously leased manufacturing facilities for a total cash outlay of seven point six million dollars. 14:50 Both of these facility purchases were ROI positive and will help secure our long-term future. This quarter, we also continued to increase inventories as we've been intentionally prioritizing customer service and product availability over trying to optimize inventory levels and risk running out of critical materials. Over the last six months, we've increased our inventories by approximately thirty million dollars. 15:16 Now if you'll turn to slide eleven, you can see the impact that Brady's historically strong cash generation has had on our balance sheet. Even after returning more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, having heightened CapEx and intentionally increasing inventory levels, on October thirty one, we were still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 15:40 Our strong balance sheet puts us in a fantastic position to execute additional value-enhancing activities, including investing in R&D, completing additional acquisitions, and returning funds to our shareholders. Our approach to capital allocation has not changed and has been serving us well. 15:59 First, we use our cash to fully fund organic sales and efficiency opportunities throughout the economic cycle. This includes investing in new product development, sales generating resources, IT improvements, capability enhancing capital expenditures and CapEx to further automate our facilities. We will also -- we will absolutely keep funding these investments where it makes sense and where the investments are ROI positive. 16:27 And second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We've now increased our annual dividend for thirty six consecutive years, which puts us in a pretty elite group of companies. 16:41 After fully funding organic investments and dividends, we then deploy our cash in a disciplined manner for either acquisitions where we believe that we have strong synergistic opportunities or for buybacks when we see a disconnect in our view of intrinsic value versus Brady's trade-in price. 17:00 Slide number twelve summarizes our guidance for the year ending July thirty one, twenty twenty two. Our full year diluted earnings per share guidance, excluding amortization, remains unchanged at a range of three point twelve dollars to three point thirty two dollars per share. On a GAAP basis, our full year diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged at a range of two point ninety dollars to three point ten dollars per share. 17:25 Included in our GAAP earnings per share guidance is an increase in after-tax amortization expense of approximately six million dollars. After-tax amortization increases from about five point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty one to about eleven point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty two, which is a delta of about zero point twelve dollars per share. 17:46 As we look at stagging throughout the rest of this fiscal year, we anticipate our short term gross profit margin challenges to persist throughout our fiscal second quarter and history shows that our second quarter is seasonally our lowest quarter of the year and generally has earnings per share below that of Q1. 18:05 As we move beyond the second quarter, we expect to see increased benefits from our pricing actions as well as the increased benefits from our many efficiency and automation projects. As a result, we continue to expect that the majority of our earnings per share growth will come in the third and fourth quarters of this year. 18:23 We also expect total sales growth to exceed twelve percent for the full year ending July thirty one, twenty twenty two which is inclusive of both organic sales growth as well as sales growth from the recently completed acquisitions. 18:39 We will continue to make the investments necessary to drive organic sales growth. We will continue to search for acquisitions that advance our strategies and we will continue to drive sustainable efficiency gains, while being tight on non-revenue generating expenses. 18:54 As for capital allocation, we'll keep investing in our organic business, we will keep investing in our industrial track and trace initiatives, we will continue to return funds to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks. We did just buyback eighteen point nine million dollars worth of shares last quarter and we'll continue to look for acquisitions where the price is right and the strategic fit is clear. 19:18 We have a strong balance sheet and we use it as a tool to drive long term shareholder value. Potential risks to this guidance, among others, include the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other major currencies such as the euro or the British pound, worsening logistics that don't allow us to meet our commitments to our customers and further inflationary pressures that we cannot offset in a timely enough manner. 19:42 I'll now turn the call back to Michael to cover our divisional results and to provide some closing comments before the Q&A session. Michael?\\nMichael Nauman: 19:52 Thank you, Aaron. Slide number thirteen outlines the first quarter financial results for our Identification Solutions business. IDS sales increased twenty five point four percent to two hundred and forty eight point six million dollars. This very robust sales growth is comprised of organic growth of thirteen point two percent, acquisition growth of eleven point six percent and an increase of zero point six percent from foreign currency translation. 20:20 Organic sales in our IDS division were once again very strong, not only versus the first quarter of last year, but also against previous sequential quarters. And on the cost side, our strong focus on sustainable efficiency gains partially offset the input cost increases that we've been experiencing. 20:39 Segment profit as a percentage of sales was nineteen point six percent, which was down from twenty point three percent last year. However, if you exclude the sizable increase in amortization that Aaron mentioned, then segment profit as a percentage of sales would have increased from twenty one percent of sales to twenty one point one percent of sales, so an increase of about ten basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. 21:07 Regionally, organic sales in Asia were strong this quarter with growth of over fifteen percent compared to the first quarter of last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of Asian organic sales growth in excess of 10%. Organic sales were also up more than fifteen percent in EMEA, despite several lockdowns continuing throughout most of the first quarter. Our European team once again did an excellent job driving sales growth while handling the period interruptions caused by the lockdowns. 21:39 We also had organic sales growth of nearly twelve percent in the Americas. We saw growth in all product lines and geographies throughout the quarter and we were especially pleased with the bounce back in our healthcare product line where organic sales growth increased approximately eleven percent. In general, the sales trends and ideas are very positive. 22:03 Our commitment to R&D remains a high priority. We've ratcheted up our investments to build a complete industrial track and trace solution. And although, we are probably a full two years away from having a complete track and trace solution, we've already been experiencing very nice synergies from our recent acquisitions and we expect these sales synergies to only increase from here on out due to the complementary nature of our product portfolios and the more complete product offerings that Code, Magicard and Nordic ID bring to Brady. 22:36 These acquisitions are performing slightly better than expected and bring us valuable technologies that help us round out our product offerings and make Brady more valuable to our customers. Clearly, we're devoting a significant amount of time and money to our track and trace product offerings, but we are not sacrificing R&D investments in other areas such as printers and materials. 23:00 We continued our steady stream of new printer introductions by launching the J4300 Brady Jet Label Printer. This inkjet printer combines with Brady’s high efficiency proprietary materials to balance the safety and complexity of compliance labels with the demands of industrial environments. 23:21 Our industrial inkjet printers save our customers time by quickly and easily creating compliant, long lasting photo quality labels, signs and tags that are needed to create a safer, more efficient workplace. It's a combination of our steady stream of best-in-class printers plus Brady's high-performance materials that sets Brady apart from our competition. 23:45 From Barcodes to extremely small text to perfect photo quality images, our customers' most important information needs to be visible and needs to stay put in any type of environment. Simply stated, Brady's printers and materials are all about high-performance in the harshest of environments. 24:06 Our R&D pipeline is strong and we continue to launch innovative new solutions that help our customers solve problems and be more efficient and effective. I'm excited about what we're doing in an ID Solutions business and how our acquisitions of Code, Nordic ID, and Magicard will further accelerate our growth. 24:27 We're improving our customer service, investing in our future, and streamlining the rest of our cost structure. These positive revenue trends combined with our strong cost discipline will help offset inflationary pressures and paint a bright future for our IDS division. 24:47 Moving to slide number fourteen, you will find a summary of Workplace Safety financial performance. WPS sales decline seven point eight percent, which consisted of an organic sales decline of eight point six percent and an increase from foreign currency of zero point eight percent. This sales decline was primarily driven by challenging comparables to last year's first quarter. 25:11 Our WPS business performed extremely well and supplied our customers with a great deal of COVID-19 related products during the pandemic last year and the demand for these types of products has declined substantially since then. Our WPS sales were seventy two point nine million dollars this quarter, which were above the pre-pandemic sales experienced in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty. 25:38 Even in these challenging times with periodic shutdowns, our European WPS team did an outstanding job of increasing its customer base. And for those customers who initially came to us to purchase COVID-related products, our team has done a nice job providing these same customers with our core safety and identification products as well. 25:59 Our Australian business performed similarly to our European business. During the pandemic, our Australian business grew organic sales over ten percent in last year's first quarter. Looking back, the challenging comparables we were pleased with this quarter's sales volumes as they were above pre-pandemic levels. 26:21 Over the last several quarters, we've increased our Australian customer base and we continue to find opportunities to enhance our digital marketing approach to ensure that we retain our new customers and turn them into long-term repeat customers. The sale of COVID-related products declined in North America as well this quarter and this decline was not fully offset by our non-COVID product offerings, thus leading to a decline in organic sales in the Americas. 26:46 And as I alluded to earlier, we've made investments to improve certain of our lagging businesses in WPS, including our business in the U.S. that primarily serves micro businesses. We've incurred start-up costs to open a new facility in the U.S. We've invested in head count, and we're also investing in additional advertising. All in, these incremental investments were approximately two point five million dollars. 27:12 These investments negatively impacted WPS' profitability this quarter, but we believe that these investments are critical to return our WPS business to sustainable long-term profitable growth. In addition to these investments, our WPS business also experienced gross margin compression as a result of raw materials, freight and wage inflation as I mentioned. 27:36 Similar to our IDS business, we're taking actions to offset these cost increases. WPS' segment profit was two point three million dollars this quarter compared to eight million dollars in last year's first quarter. This reduction in segment profit was directly related to the reduced sales volumes, the incremental investments that I just mentioned, as well as significant cost pressures. 27:58 Our WPS team members are listening to their customers to identify what they need. They are modifying their marketing campaigns to reach entirely new customers and entirely new industries and they are working hard to address underperforming businesses within the portfolio. 28:16 Our Workplace Safety business has one more quarter of moderately difficult comparables ahead of it, but we are laying the foundation for a solid recovery. I'm proud of the role that Brady played and continues to play in this long ever-changing fight against COVID-19. 28:34 Our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety products help companies with social distancing, our products help schools reopen safely, and safety and identification products were used by our front-line workers all around the globe. 28:50 And now our products are helping our customers increase efficiency to help them meet their own set of customer demand. This pandemic is not over and the financial impacts stemming from the pandemic are certainly not over. Throughout the pandemic, we invested in growth and efficiencies and its continued level of investment that will enable us to keep this strong positive momentum. 29:15 Brady is in an enviable financial position. We're coming off of record EPS here. Our earnings are up and our balance sheet is very strong. We're in a net cash position even after making three acquisitions toward the end of last year and returning more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends this quarter. 29:36 We will continue to invest in R&D, sales generating resources, and capacity enhancing CapEx, all while being very tight on non-revenue generating expenses and aggressively working through global logistical issues and inflationary forces. 29:55 I'm very proud of how our team performed throughout this challenging period. Their ability to deal with uncertainty, think on their feet, and solve problems quickly all while never compromising the long-term has built a solid foundation for Brady's future. 30:11 With that, I'd like to now start the Q&A. Operator, would you please provide instructions to our listeners?\\nOperator: 30:20 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael McGinn at Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nMichael McGinn: 30:37 Hey. Good morning, everybody.\\nMichael Nauman: 30:38 Good morning, Michael.\\nMichael McGinn: 30:42 I wanted to go -- talk about Workplace Safety for a second. So, you mentioned sales are kind of in line with those pre-COVID levels and I'm wondering, if holding the line on the Workplace Safety business those sales, is the goal versus Identification Solutions, if you strip out the acquisitions, it's materially above pre-COVID levels, is Workplace Safety core to shareholder value?\\nMichael Nauman: 31:12 Great question, Michael. We are working hard to really change the profile of WPS in a significant and meaningful way. We are investing significantly in R&D, we're investing in in-sourcing key products, we're investing in getting closer to our customers. We believe that we have a value-add equation there that is unique in the marketplace as we execute these changes. It is going to take time. We are already down that path. We're excited about what we see from that. But this is not a quick situation and they have also been plagued more significantly than IDS, in that, A, a much larger percentage of their products are brought in, and B, a much larger percentage of their products come from Asia. So, they have a both logistical and cost pressures there. So, we absolutely see more short-term difficulties in that business, but we do believe that it is a business that overall, we can continue to provide significant shareholder value over the long term. That said, I want to be clear on all of our businesses, we evaluate our portfolio. We have in the past looked at some businesses that didn't make sense putting into our portfolio. We will continue to do that. We are very strongly cognizant of our critical need to make sure that we're always providing our shareholders with the most significant return for their investment.\\nMichael McGinn: 32:48 Great. And then switching gears to the gross margin conversation and the chips, you mentioned being able to kind of maybe hold the line up fifty percent gross margin last quarter, not a whole lot of noise from chips and you mentioned being proactive. What change quarter-to-quarter and does this current situation alleviate or does it push you to make more of an eighty, twenty portfolio pruning approach to you need to sunset some legacy products here to kind of make way for the newer product suites?\\nMichael Nauman: 33:22 It's excellent. Things are changing rapidly. I'm sure you're hearing that across the board. We have very good connections throughout all industrial business space and we know that what we're dealing with is certainly not unique. But the challenges of logistics, as I mentioned last quarter, I believe hopefully I did, I'd have to go back and listen to the tape. We do think will last for eighteen to twenty four months, that is not a guarantee of timing, but it is our latest belief and our continued latest belief on how this will impact things. 34:01 What that means is product sets, even in IDS that are more dependent, we have those on Asian imported products are dealing with much larger sourcing difficulties and also timing difficulties. We have made a lot of proactive steps. I know for a fact that in many ways we're able to service our customers better than our competition today and it is our goal to continue to do that. 34:29 But as far as pruning products, we look at that regularly. Throughout my tenure at Brady, we've pruned a number of products and continue to look at that cycle, and make sure we're offering our customers the best and the brightest. As an example, with our printers years ago when I first got here, we would allow the products to really just run to life before developing new ones. 34:52 We have an extremely strong pipeline, roadmap, and we make sure that we are always upgrading our products on a reliable basis. So, we never experienced that. So, we've created a very natural pruning process with all of our products that really look at life cycle capabilities. So, for instance, things like software upgraded, much more rapidly firmware and then hardware and we have a cadence depending on the product sets and the markets to do that. 35:25 But to be unequivocal, yes, we are taking this opportunity to look at all of our products to make sure that it's a product that still makes sense in the long-term marketplace. As you come out of a downturn like a pandemic or any other downturn or you look at our workplace changes that have come out of this, you have to be cognizant of the fact that our customers do have changing needs. And we believe a lot of our products are becoming more digital, more focused on interconnectivity re system approach, and therefore that does lead to pruning in the other direction as well.\\nMichael McGinn: 36:00 Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 36:02 Thank you, sir.\\nOperator: 36:04 Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Ferazani of Sidoti. Your line is open.\\nSteve Ferazani: 36:12 Good morning, everyone. I did want to follow up on a question about Workplace Safety. You mentioned the two point five million dollars of investments in the quarter. But, those sound like more like expected ongoing costs every quarter. So, it sounds like to get your margins back to pre-COVID levels, you're going to have to get revenue up substantially?\\nMichael Nauman: 36:38 Steve, those are actually one-time costs. Those are absolutely one-time costs. We are careful and as you know, through our history and your knowledge of our history, we are very careful not to bucketize costs that are not one-time is one-time. In this case, the majority of those expenses, the vast majority were related to opening up a new facility that is already proving itself logistically to be tremendous help in us re-growing that business. In particular, as you know, micro businesses in the U.S. were dramatically disproportionately impacted, but we're already seeing the green shoots that I spoke about six, nine months ago that we would see. We're already seeing them from new start-ups. 37:28 The good news about having a lot of cash right now in society is that the entrepreneurial spirit in the U.S. is alive and well and we will definitely see new businesses starting up that benefit from our product sets and we've repositioned that business to be located in an area that is very advantageous to be much more successful even than we were in the past before the pandemic. So, no, those are definitely one-time costs.\\nSteve Ferazani: 37:56 Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for clarifying. In terms of clearly logistics problems will hurt, obviously, going through the 3Q conference calls we've heard this across the board that they are clearly worse than they were three months ago. You're maintaining guidance. I'm just trying to figure out, are you figuring out more work arounds, are you just getting a sense that maybe it sounds like you don't see an end to it. So, I'm just trying to figure out why maintain guidance if logistics problems are getting at least worse in the near term?\\nMichael Nauman: 38:28 Well, just to speak more specifically about logistics, they vary by business, by percentage of imported products, by location. So, let me give you an example. In Australia, everything -- not everything, but we certainly import from Europe, the U.S., and Asia significantly larger amount of products than we do from other locations. Their logistics, their shipping costs, things like that are up incredibly. Even cross-country in Australia, the shipping costs are up large amounts. 39:03 Historically, as I've told you in the past, I believe last quarter, I can count on two percent is the shipping cost number throughout -- most of my history in international businesses and it is way up depending on the business above that. So, those are not going to go away. We definitely see those continuing to be impacted. Obviously, fuel rates things like that will change things, but we are anticipating that our cost remain up for an extensive period of time. 39:33 In addition, suppliers are having lots of different pressures from labor inflation to core material cost inflation that they are in some cases passing on more or less aggressively and we are certainly very aggressive about making sure we have a cost effective and significantly positive supply base, but we don't see that going away. 40:02 And so where we're pushing is on things like automation we're excelling. I think that you are aware we just introduced and literally are just almost fully completely functional on our inventory storage system in our major North American distribution center. This is both a way to rapidly increase our ability to be productive, but also to significantly reduce our costs. 40:34 We're able to get products out to our customers quicker and a higher quality rate because of this, but also less dependent on labor that is difficult to find and the costs are increasing. So, our automation efforts from that to our machinery equipment, they are all really -- many of them are coming to fruition that we were working on before the pandemic started. So, I believe we're ahead of lot of our competition, but we continue to invest in that area as well. 41:01 And then the last lever that is very significant is, we look at the value of our products to our customers, the costs that we face and we go to them, understanding that they are facing challenges as well and make sure that our prices are aligned with what the value we provide is and are increasing those across the board, but relative each product set. 41:27 We are not a peanut butter type of company, we're not a peanut butter approach, we're looking at all the value statements we provide and driving our prices based on that. So those levers we are working on very hard. Our teams are very resourceful. Without getting into specifics, I literally heard a brilliant idea yesterday that will provide great product for our customer at the same price, but greatly reduce our cost structure on it. 41:54 So we've got a lot going on in that area. So, we are confident that although, we've told you the second quarter is still going to be a challenge, that the third and fourth quarters we see a definite road map to our future as we projected.\\nSteve Ferazani: 42:10 Great. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 42:13 Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.\\nOperator: 42:15 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\\nKeith Housum: 42:24 Good morning, guys. Michael, just kind of elaborating on the previous conversation here, does it sound like this quarter or perhaps the second quarter will be like a low point of your cost of -- your margin pressures and you perhaps have a little visibility or line of visibility into it creeping back up?\\nMichael Nauman: 42:44 Yeah, Keith. I think our biggest opportunity set is in regard to revenue. I really feel very good about our ability to continue to drive our revenue. I don't have a perfect crystal ball. I know I've used that analogy with you in years' past. I don't have a perfect crystal ball, but what I do know is that we're pulling all the right levers to accomplish that goal. 43:10 I'm not going to give you a perfect prognosis of, hey, our margins are going to be X, Y, and Z by the third or fourth quarter. But I think in combination with revenue increases and really improving pricing and improving our cost structure and our logistics structure, I do feel confident that we'll be able to continue down the path that we're on for the guidance we've given.\\nKeith Housum: 43:38 Okay. And you referenced some challenges getting some products in the door as well, some challenges hiring the right amount people. Is there a sense that you lost out on some revenue during the quarter because of those challenges or do you got it done just costing more to get it done?\\nMichael Nauman: 43:53 Yes and yes. It's definitely cost a lot more. Without giving specific products, we've been air shipping products we never shipped before. I can also tell you, some of those products are now on ships in addition to air shipping. So, we are -- there were some key products we absolutely needed to get to our customers. 44:15 Our first goal is to get them to our customers even though the cost may not be what we want, but we want to get them to our customers. And so, we did do that with a lot of air shipping. We currently do have some of those key products on ships again, thank goodness, but what that means is, we were able to get ahead of the curve and produce enough extra that we could still keep shipping by air, but put a bunch on ships. So, that is absolutely true in that regard. We definitely moved the first and foremost. 44:50 Now, did we ship everything we wanted to ship? No, we didn't. But I will tell you, I was personally amazed at the Herculean effort at some of our factories to close out October, Amazed. It was a tremendous effort and it made me literally just proud of all our people of how hard they work, how driven they were. 45:15 We've got a very motivated team and they have a lot of pride. They have a lot of pride in getting to our customers what they need and they don't want to let them down. And so, although we did leave some material on the shelf and some material in the system, we really closed the gap in a very significant way.\\nKeith Housum: 45:37 Okay. And then the final question from me, you referenced price increases going into effect. Can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the end markets which just price increases you will be going toward and you guys raise your prices on a regular cycle, so just want to confirm is this off-cycle in IDS, WPS, and Crafts, any color on the amount that you're being forced to raise prices?\\nMichael Nauman: 46:01 Well, first of all, I don't say across the board because we don't peanut butter spread, but the truth is, there is some level of price increase across the board. It just isn't -- we're not putting in place X, Y, Z percent across the board and the timing does vary, Keith. We have contracts, we have agreements, we need to interact with our customers. We treat our customers with a lot of respect. We care about them tremendously. But at the same time, to your point, we have to pass on the value that we create in price increases to them as we're dealing with those pressures. 46:37 Timing, we do have off-cycle increases, we do have on-cycle increases. We are overall raising our prices more than we have in the historical past as our most industrial companies right now. So, overall, I'd say this, yes, off-cycle increases, yes, on-cycle increases and larger increases. But it does absolutely vary by product set and the cost pressures that we're facing in the cost -- product set. 47:06 You also mentioned regions, that's also true on regions. We're raising prices effectively in all regions, but those price increase timing and amounts do vary by region, by customer, by product set. So, yes, this is a significant effort for Brady right now. As I guarantee and I talked to a lot of people, it is for almost all organizations.\\nKeith Housum: 47:34 Yeah. All right. Thanks, Michael. Good luck.\\nMichael Nauman: 47:37 Thank you, sir. Have a great one. Thanks, Keith.\\nOperator: 47:40 Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nMichael McGinn: 47:45 Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering, if you had a sense of how lean you think the distribution channel is, how much room there still is to restock and what kind of percentage of your total business that represents?\\nMichael Nauman: 48:00 Well, I apologize, I may not have heard the question perfectly. I'm not sure that was on the slide. But I think what you're asking me, I will say this, we are not seeing significant stock-ups by the distribution channel and that's good news, in that, I do eventually expect an economic boomerang from stocking up, but we are definitely not seeing it right now with our partners, our distributor partners. 48:29 Little harder to tell with our end users, but if you look at society overall and what's happening and I think we probably are seeing some of that. But it's a little harder to tell. But better that I know that it isn't definitely happening right now with our distributor partners. And so therefore, I’m optimistic that volumes will continue to go up in the near future. 48:54 What happens at the end as things untangle from this is yet to be seen. But I would expect, not for us, but for a general economic pullback as there is more inventory and you know this from all the numbers in the system overall than there historically has been.\\nMichael McGinn: 49:18 Great. Then switching gears to the geopolitical front, trade talks have seemingly resumed and we now have an infrastructure framework. Any overall commentary on where you see yourself benefiting in infrastructure and then on the trade, any kind of benchmarks you that the percentage of total imports of your business is?\\nMichael Nauman: 49:45 Well, I'd tell you this, first about we love anything related to infrastructure. We believe we provide products that are critical for the world infrastructure, not just the U.S., but in your particular case, the question. The U.S. is so yes, we do definitely see some very positive construction. We do very well in the construction industry, as a result of the safety needs, identification needs of that industry, their need for high quality, high durability. So, we are excited about that. Obviously, that's going to take some time and the whole construction industry is still tangled up right now. 50:25 So you know, if you're – I’ve been analogy, which is probably myth, but Napoleon lost the war for a lack of a nail, in horseshoe in our horse on a cannon in the Battle of Waterloo. So, that is what I believe the construction industry is facing right now. If you go through a lot of areas in that way buildings are being finished because of literally one or two critical elements. And so, I do think that's going to take a little while to untangle that will impact the rolling out of the infrastructure money, as far as getting to us. But you know what the great news, because we're towards the end of that cycle, typically, the great news is, it will come typically. The great news is it will come. And when it does come that will definitely help Brady. 51:14 Now, let's talk about trade barriers and all of that, we -- it's interesting, everything from automation to developing new products for the next generation to forward to in-sourcing, to forward deploying our products. We've been working on for about five years now, ahead of a lot of companies are just now realizing that's the direction the world is going. By the way, because of the pandemic, so I'm not going to say, I foretold the pandemic, we absolutely did not. No idea. But we were believe -- we believe we were intelligently moving in the direction of the world would have to eventually go. It just happened to be fortuitous. And I don't want to take advantage of a bad situation, but the reality is that we have been positioned proactively for that. 52:02 Why am I saying that because we have forward deployed a lot of resources as close to our customers as possible, as in company – country’s possible. So let me give you an example that's not directly related to trade barriers in the very recent, but the Brexit issue, we have plants and some capabilities all throughout the UK that are really going to and already benefiting from the need to in-source into the UK more products. And that can be said for France and Germany, the Benelux areas, the U.S. China, India, I mean, again and again we are adding resources that we've had in the works in facilities and people to new countries and new regions. 52:48 So, I believe our footprint forward deploying as much as possible to be as reactive, positively reactive to our customers as possible is also going to benefit from this new barrier-oriented mentality. We did it for our customers. We did it for responsiveness. We did it to make sure we always have the products where we need win, but as a result, we fortuitously are going to benefit from this as well.\\nMichael McGinn: 53:18 Understood. Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 53:20 Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.\\nOperator: 53:24 Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Michael Nauman for any closing results -- remarks.\\nMichael Nauman: 53:31 Thank you so much. I'd like to leave you with a few concluding comments this morning. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly entered a new phase. In this phase, we're seeing stress supply chains, increased input costs, labor shortages and overall increased inflation. We're working through this effectively, but we are experiencing some short-term margin compression. 53:56 I don't know what the future holds for the global economy, but I do know that Brady is well positioned to thrive regardless of which direction the economy heads. We have a strong balance sheet. We're prioritizing investments for growth and we have a never-ending focus on cash generation. 54:14 As a result, we're seeing strong sales growth at once our pricing and efficiency initiatives catch up to the cost inflation, our strong sales growth and improved gross profit margins will drive significant bottom-line growth. 54:31 On a final note, I would like to wish a very special Happy Birthday to our own Ann Thornton here at Brady. It is her birthday today. I'm not allowed to say which one, but happy birthday and from all of your friends at Brady, please stay safe. Thank you for your time this morning. Have a great day. Operator, you may disconnect the call.\\nOperator: 54:55 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\"]],\n",

Just a reminder today's call is being recorded. 00:14 I will now turn the call over to Dave Slater, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nDave Slater: 00:21 Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal twenty twenty two results. Participants on the call expect to make forward looking statements. These statements reflect the participant’s expectations as of today, but actual results could be different. 00:38 Genesco refers you to this morning's earnings release and the company's Sec filings including the most recent ten Q and ten K filings for some of the factors, including the impact of COVID-nineteen that could cause differences from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements made during the call today. 00:59 Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call. All non-GAAP financial measures referred to in the prepared remarks are reconciled to their GAAP counterparts and the attachments to this morning's press release and in schedules available on the company's homepage under Investor Relations in the quarterly earnings section. I want to remind everyone we have posted a presentation summarizing our results that is accessible on our website. 01:28 With me on the call today is Mimi Vaughn, our Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will begin our prepared remarks highlights from the second quarter; and Tom George, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our Q2 results in more detail and provide direction for Q3. 01:46 Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mimi.\\nMimi Vaughn: 01:49 Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Following an incredibly strong start to fiscal twenty two, we delivered an outstanding second quarter performance as our top line accelerated even further ahead of pre pandemic levels and we produced record Q2 EPS that well exceeded our expectations. With much stronger revenue highlighted by robust full price selling and good expense management, our second quarter profit for our footwear businesses also set a new record. 02:23 The levels at which our business performed during the first half of the year following a challenging fiscal twenty one reflects the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, close connections with our customers and the compelling execution of our footwear focused strategy to transform our business and deliver these results. 02:44 We are a stronger company coming out of the pandemic. Our results highlight the work we've done to accelerate online sales and enhance our store and omnichannel offerings as we create and curate leading footwear brands to be the destination for our consumers favorite fashion footwear. 03:04 Our teams continue to do a superb job providing the right product our customers are looking for combined with exceptional service and differentiated shopping experiences. Our outperformance was driven by better than anticipated results across the board with all businesses exceeding pre pandemic profit levels. 03:26 As excited as we are with the progress we are making, we are even more excited about our strategy and our future opportunity to build upon this foundation and drive growth, profit, and shareholder value. 03:41 I'll begin by providing some highlights from the quarter. Both revenue and adjusted operating income exceeded pre pandemic levels, increasing fourteen percent and three forty six percent respectively over fiscal year twenty, two years ago and higher operating profit delivered a record Q2 EPS of one point zero five dollars compared with a loss of one point two three dollars last year and positive zero point one five dollars two years ago all on an adjusted basis. 04:15 Additional highlights include delivering another strong quarter of digital results with double digit operating profit to achieve a nineteen percent digital penetration. This was driven by a ninety seven percent increase in digital revenue compared to fiscal year twenty as we retained almost eighty percent of last year's volume which was elevated due to store closures. 04:40 Next, driving much higher conversion and transaction size to deliver store sales that were almost at pre pandemic levels, increasing gross margin by six forty basis points versus last year and fifty basis points compared to fiscal twenty driven primarily by higher full price selling. 04:59 Leveraging adjusted SG&A by two thirty basis points compared to pre-pandemic levels and further strengthening of our already strong balance sheet and cash position enabling a balanced approach of investing in our business while also returning capital to shareholders going forward. As the vaccine rollout continued and economies on both side of the Atlantic more broadly reopened, consumers aided by government stimulus, stepped up their footwear purchasing in the quarter and chose to shop with our brands to satisfy their pent up demand. 05:35 We were pleased that every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations. Digital has been a key strategic initiative and the investments we've made have allowed us to double our e-commerce business in two years. However, we've also talked about how much our customers enjoy our store experience and the important role of our stores as a strategic asset in a compelling omnichannel offering, which proved out once again this quarter. 06:05 So, turning now to discuss each business in more detail beginning with Journeys. The Journeys team once again did a tremendous job capitalizing on current market momentum and achieved record revenue and operating profit in the second quarter marking the third consecutive quarter with record profitability. 06:26 Journeys performance as we emerge from the pandemic, highlights the competitive advantage the business has built and how we are leveraging those advantages to further separate ourselves from the rest of the industry as the destination for fashion footwear for teens. 06:42 Leading into decades of experience, and its unparalleled vendor partnership, Journeys definitely navigated global supply chain disruptions to secure supply of the brands and styles most coveted by its customers. 06:57 The current fashion cycle, which has been shifting more to casual product placed into Journeys wheelhouse with strength in the assortment across the board, highlighted by the balance in its top ten brands evenly split in the quarter between casual and fashion athletic. 07:15 On trend merchandise assortments and effective consumer engagement through social and other channels fuel strong demand and full price selling with particular strength in women's and kids. Both store and e-com revenue were up compared to pre-pandemic levels with digital leading the way even with much higher conversion rates and transaction size, driving store volumes. 07:40 Over in the UK Schuh delivered a solid top line increase compared to the second quarter two years ago, as government mandated lockdowns were listed and the retail sector experienced its first quarter of mostly uninterrupted operations for the first time since before Christmas. 07:59 Schuh business rebounded steadily, driven by pent demand and our successful efforts to drive sales of multiple pairs. And even as consumers increasingly return to physical shopping, Schuh retained much of the online gains from a year ago, resulting in online contributing almost forty five percent of total sales. 08:22 The UK retail market is going through a highly disruptive phase with strong consumer propensity to shop online and with many retail bankruptcies reshaping the landscape. The Schuh team is taking advantage of this disruption, utilizing its advanced digital offering to strengthen consumer connections during the lockdowns. And those efforts are paying off as the market reopens and shoppers once again have the choice to engage with the brand either online or in-store. 08:54 Many of the product and brand trends driving Schuh’s performance as usual are the same as Journeys, but with a slightly heavier tilt towards fashion athletic. Another highlight of the second quarter was the more rapid than expected pace of Johnston & Murphy’s recovery, boosted by an improving market environment and strong demand for many of the brand's newest product offerings. 09:19 With a number of social events and family gatherings increasing and more customers returning to in person shopping. Retail traffic improved each successive month during the second quarter, building upon the gains in the first quarter. 09:34 At the same time, e-commerce revenue grew strongly, increasing over fifty percent compared to pre-pandemic levels as customers chose the digital channel to engage with the brand. We were especially pleased with the performance of J&M’s new athletically inspired casual assortment. Sell-throughs were very strong with many new items selling out in both our direct to consumer channels, as well as in the wholesale channel where J&M gained significant market share. 10:05 These product launches accompanied by enhanced marketing campaigns are attracting a younger customer validating our efforts to re-imagine the storied J&M brand beyond its dress-shoe roots into a modern lifestyle brand with broad consumer reach. With second quarter sales nearing pre pandemic levels combined with strong full price selling, J&M’s operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels a remarkable turnaround compared to last year. 10:36 These trends are adding to our optimism for continued improvement whenever America begins the return to office phase hopefully later this year. Rounding up the highlights from the quarter, licensed brands revenue more than doubled versus a year ago, reflecting the growing contribution from the footwear license we acquired in January twenty twenty. 11:00 Operating profit improved versus pre pandemic levels, although not at the rate we expected due to higher freight costs, which are temporarily pressuring near term margins. We continue to be very pleased with how Levi's product is selling in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys to Journeys kids to family footwear. 11:22 This has led to a strong order book for the back half and reinforces our excitement about the potential to create value by combining Powerful brand licenses with our fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities. 11:38 Turning now to the current quarter, we have been pleased with our results to date as sales track ahead of pre pandemic levels in August, and we are several weeks into the all important back to school selling season. 11:53 Last year's back to school was like none before since most children began the school year learning remotely. This year, the vast majority of students are beginning the school year in person which is driving more robust sales. 12:07 While the Delta variant back to work timing and other factors will drive different patterns of consumption in the back half with a healthy and resilient consumer and the strength of our offering. We remain confident in our ability drive sales above fiscal twenty level for the remainder of the year. 12:27 We will work hard to continue to successfully implement strategies to overcome the inventory, supply chain, labor, cost pressure and other headwinds that are endemic in our industry today. Tom will give additional details on our outlook. 12:45 Shifting gears, our footwear focused strategy is working and is delivering results. This strategy implemented before the pandemic leverages our strong direct to consumer capabilities across footwear retail and brands and the synergies between platforms. 13:04 Driving this strategy are six strategic pillars that emphasize continued investments in digital and omnichannel, deepening our consumer insights, driving product innovation, reshaping our cost space and pursuing synergistic acquisitions all to transform our business and exceed the expectation of today's consumer whose needs have rapidly advanced. 13:30 In addition, COVID has provided us the real opportunity to transform our business at a faster rate. And we are on a very good pace to deliver growth and improved operating margins. While each of the six pillars is important to achieving our future objectives. I'd like to expand on just a few of our initiatives, which are driving results, while Tom will discuss reshaping the cost base. 13:58 Our strong digital growth highlights the progress we're making with this key strategic initiative. In Q2, we welcomed forty eight million visitors to our website and new e-commerce customers increased eighty percent from pre-pandemic levels. Data driven consumer insights, more robust CRM and enhanced marketing are key to increasing consumer engagement and driving our next big wave of growth. 14:27 Schuh is taking advantage of the market disruption brought on by the pandemic and to invest further in new customer prospecting through digital marketing designed to target competitors customers, as well as geo targeting where competitors physical locations have closed. These efforts have helped contribute to an increase new online customers of more than one hundred percent compared to pre pandemic levels. 14:54 Journeys marketing efforts are gaining leverage by focusing on influencers, who the team consumer views as more authentic, creating a more organic experience that further builds upon the trust Journeys has established with this customer. This content is being delivered through social media channels and SMS, helping to drive a significant increase of fifty plus percent of new online customers. 15:20 In addition, Journeys continues to make progress implementing an upgraded integrated customer database with enhanced CRM capabilities, which will improve customer retention and acquisition and provide a clearer view of customer lifetime value. 15:36 To keep up with this increase in digital demand Journeys is wrapping up testing and bringing online another bespoke e-commerce fulfillment module, which doubles capacity ahead of the ramp up of demand for online orders during holiday. 15:52 We are underway rolling out North America new point of sale hardware and software along with new tablets, advancing our efforts to digitize our stores and enhance the omnichannel channel shopping experience. 16:05 For consumers [tablets] (ph) facilitate easy access to the full assortment anywhere in our system and upgrade our client telling efforts. And mobile checkout allows consumers to skip the checkout line. For employees, this new technology creates efficiencies across a variety of in store tasks, such as new hire on-boarding and employee training and communication. 16:31 With J&M’s accelerating recovery; we can put greater focus on the next phase, re-imagining the brand. Product innovation and technology is at the center of differentiating J&M’s casual products and commanding more premium price points. 16:49 Launches of the athletically inspired Amhurst and Activate collections and the expansion of the J&M golf collection were highly successful this Spring and another major step moving the brand beyond its dress-shoe origins. 17:03 J&M's design team is focused on expanding its technology toolbox with innovation, including the [access chassis] (ph) system, which offers optimal support, comfort and flexibility; TrueForm, which delivers superior cushion and lightweight comfort; and Smart Degree, which is temperature regulation technology. 17:26 New product design and technology coupled with consumer insights and amplified marketing messaging will be the winning formula to grow J&M as a fresh lifestyle brand with broader consumer reach. 17:39 Turning to ESG, we continue to advance these efforts including the establishment of our Board's ESG sub-committee, and we are working toward publication of a comprehensive ESG report next year. Again, these are just a few of the initiatives that are driving positive transformation for Genesco. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress and on other initiatives. 18:05 Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to thank and congratulate all our people across our company for your excellent execution, hard work and great success in the first half of this year. 18:18 You continue to superbly navigate a dynamic and challenging environment with the health and safety of each other in mind and I continue to be amazed by your drive and determination. 18:30 Genesco’s future is so bright because of you all. 18:34 Finally, our thoughts are with our neighbors to the rest of us in Nashville affected by the devastating floods last week, and those impacted this week by Hurricane Ida. 18:44 Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.\\nTom George: 18:46 Thanks, Mimi. As Mimi mentioned, total Q2 results far exceeded our expectations and last year across the board. For comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our fiscal twenty provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance and the return of our business to pre-pandemic levels. However, when comparing to fiscal twenty, I would like to remind everyone how our strategy has changed our business. E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales and our licensed brand segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales. 19:33 These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses. While these changes will reshape the P and L, they have a positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital intensive business model. 20:00 Turning back to Q2 results, I'm pleased to report that not only did the second quarter continue, but it accelerated the sequential improvement of our operating results since the onset of the pandemic. Higher revenue and gross margin combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal twenty and Q2 adjusted earnings per share of one point zero five dollars compared to zero point one five dollars in fiscal twenty. 20:35 In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was five fifty five million, up fourteen percent compared to fiscal twenty, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, which is up ninety seven percent versus fiscal twenty, taking overall digital sales to nineteen percent of our retail business compared to ten percent in fiscal twenty twenty. 21:04 Digital growth combined with much higher wholesale revenue drove strong sales improvements for Journeys shoe and license brands compared to pre-pandemic levels, while J&M made significant strides narrowing its revenue gap. We did not provide overall or store comp results for Q2 as our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for seven consecutive days either this year or last year, and therefore, we feel that overall sales is a more meaningful metric. 21:40 With stores open for ninety seven percent of the possible days in the quarter, overall store revenue was down only one percent versus fiscal twenty. Consolidated gross margin was forty nine point one percent up fifty basis points from fiscal twenty, driven by full price selling, partially offset by the mix shift towards license brands and higher shipping costs from higher penetration of e-commerce. 22:12 While e-commerce puts pressure on our gross margin rate, as I mentioned, it comes with a lower cost structure and double digit operating income. Journeys gross margin increased two twenty basis points, driven by lower markdowns in both stores and online. Schuh’s gross margin decreased two hundred basis points due entirely to the higher shipping expense from the shift in e-commerce channel mix. 22:44 J&M’s gross margin increased five seventy basis points benefiting from fewer markdowns taken on pack-and-hold inventory and higher full price selling. 22:56 Finally, the revenue growth of license brands, typically our lowest gross margin rate negatively impacted the overall mix by ninety basis points. Adjusted SG&A expense was forty five point three percent, a two thirty basis point improvement compared to fiscal twenty twenty as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions around expense management. 23:25 The largest year over year savings came from occupancy cost, driven by the UK Government program, which provides property tax relief, rent concession across our businesses and ongoing rent savings on renewals. 23:42 The next largest areas of savings came from the reduction in store salaries, thanks to the effective use of workforce management tools to drive higher conversion in the face of significant wage pressure. These savings were partially offset by higher incentive compensation, driven by improved profitability and increased marketing expenses needed to drive traffic in both stores and online. 24:14 As the multi-year shift in consumer traffic continues towards online and away from brick and mortar, our organization has been intently focused on the critical effort to right-size occupancy cost to be in line with store traffic. The pandemic has exacerbated the transition to digital and we continue to have even greater traction on rent reductions. 24:40 Year to date through Q2 we have negotiated seventy five renewals and achieved a twenty nine percent reduction in rent expense in North America. This was on top of a twenty two percent reduction for one hundred and twenty three renewals last year. These renewals are for even shorter term average in approximately two years compared to the three year average we have seen in recent years. 25:09 With over forty percent of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this will remain a key priority for us going forward. 25:18 In summary, the second quarter's adjusted operating income was twenty one point one million versus fiscal 2020’s four point seven million. All operating divisions achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal led by Journeys nearly one hundred and seventy percent increase. Our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was twenty five percent. 25:45 Turning now to the balance sheet. Q2 total inventory was down twenty seven percent compared to fiscal twenty on sales that were up fourteen percent as we remain challenged, keeping pace with the consumer demand levels and with delivery delays. Our ending net cash position was two eighty four million, seventy million dollars higher than the first quarter's level driven by strong cash generation from operations. 26:14 As a reminder, we currently have ninety million dollars remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase plan, and we have a solid track record of returning cash to our shareholders. Capital expenditures were eight million dollars as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel and depreciation and amortization was eleven million. We closed eight stores and opened three during the second quarter. 26:45 We will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or full fiscal twenty twenty two. However, I would like to provide some color around our expectations using the pre-pandemic fiscal twenty as the reference point. As we transition into Q3, thus far, we have experienced a more normalized back to school selling season for Journeys and Schuh, but is expected the impact from stimulus has moderated and due to the spread of the Delta variant, there are more questions around when customers will begin returning to their offices, which will impact J&M’s trend and whether Delta will disrupt in-store shopping. Supply chain disruptions persist, pressuring both the top line and product cost. 27:38 Now getting to more specifics of Q3 starting with revenue. We expect higher revenue compared to fiscal twenty levels, given the strength of our assortment. This is mainly due to continued strength from the Levi's business and growth at Journeys and Schuh. J&M will likely remain under fiscal twenty’s level. 28:03 Directionally, the overall sales increase for Q3 compared to fiscal twenty twenty could be up mid-to-high single-digits. From a channel perspective, the highest growth will once again come from wholesale and direct. We expect gross margin rates for Q3 will be somewhat under fiscal twenty levels, due to substantial pressure from import freight increases at J&M and license brands from supply chain disruptions. 28:37 We expect the retail promotional environment to remain favorable, offsetting the ongoing pressure from higher e-commerce penetration and the higher shipping cost that come with it, as well as the impact of licensed brands growth, on our business model as previously discussed. 28:59 We expect that Q3 adjusted SG&A will be a little better as a percentage of sales than in fiscal twenty twenty. Sequentially, we will not see the large SG&A leverage we saw in Q2 as revenue growth will be lower and the benefits from some government relief programs will be less than Q2. 29:23 That being said, compared to fiscal twenty, higher revenue will boost leverage in both occupancy and selling salaries partially offset by higher marketing and performance based compensation as we anticipate higher bonus expense than fiscal twenty twenty. 29:40 In summary, we expect the operating income to be similar to fiscal year twenty levels and the margin rate to be somewhat lower than fiscal year twenty due to these factors, in particular, the increased import freight in our branded businesses. 29:58 For taxes, we expect the Q3 tax rate to be around the twenty five percent we saw in Q2. The annual tax rate is expected to be approximately thirty percent. In addition when comparing results, we had some expense pickups like rent abatements in the back half of fiscal twenty one, particularly in Q4. We don't expect to recur in the back half this year. 30:27 Next, I would like to provide a brief update on our cost savings initiative. Given the shift of our business from stores to digital, accelerated by the impact from the pandemic, we continue to make progress on reshaping our cost structure and allocating resources towards digital growth. 30:45 As a reminder, our target for the year is to identify savings and operating expenses of twenty five million to thirty million on an annualized basis or approximately three percent of total operating expenses. The entire organization is focused on this critical initiative, and I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress towards our target. 31:11 The teams have identified over twenty million dollars of savings with the largest amount coming from rent and the remainder in several areas, including increased selling salary productivity, travel conventions, inner store freight, marketing, compensation and other overheads. These savings benefit primarily the store channel and its profitability. 31:39 The cost savings initiative is a key pillar in our strategy to transform our business. Designed to reflect a more capital efficient model, focusing on driving further improvements in return on invested capital and allowing for improved flexibility in our operating model. Going forward, we see opportunities to be less dependent on store capital expenditures have lower lease obligations and continue to drive efficient use of inventory. 32:11 In conclusion, I would like to thank all our employees for such an incredible start to the fiscal year. These results emphasize that we have the right team and the right strategy to continue to drive shareholder value. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.\\nOperator: 32:34 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Please proceed with your question.\\nMitch Kummetz: 33:11 Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Let me start with the guidance or the outlook for Q3. So, I think you said sales up mid-to-high single-digits on a two year basis. Can you say kind of where August came in relative to that? Is August better than that? You're expecting some moderation or can you maybe just provide a little color on that?\\nMimi Vaughn: 33:37 Sure. Let me – hi, Mitch, it’s Mimi. Let me start and then turn it over to Tom. I think that it's important to put August in the dimension of what happened last year with back to school and also this year. So things were a lot different a year ago. We estimated that two thirds of students attended school only virtually to start the year. 34:00 This year, we estimated that there was a real push to get kids back into school and we're estimating that essentially all students went back in person. And so, we had a great second quarter and coming into the quarter we thought that back to school also would be positive and we have continued to see, we've been pleased with the results so far, we've got the right assortment. We've been pleased with what we have seen. 34:28 One important note is that the Labor Day this year compared to fiscal year twenty and that's what we keep comparing to is, one week later. So, we're going to know basically this weekend, what the comparison period is. So, we're tracking to and above fiscal year twenty levels overall, and we'll know more when we complete the Labor Day weekend. We also think that there is a likelihood of back to school having a longer tail in September and October, like it did last year. 35:06 We didn't see a lot of sales in July and August last year, but people waited to see exactly what might happen in schools and there was more purchasing later on. And Tom I don’t know if you had anything to add to that?\\nTom George: 35:19 No, I think that's a good summary. We feel really good how we're tracking so far and keep in mind; we have more of a wholesale business this year as well relative to two years ago. So, that tracks really at a different pace than the retail business and we do expect some good growth out of our direct channel as well this year relative to two years ago. So, feel really good where we're tracking so far.\\nMimi Vaughn: 35:46 Yeah. And I'd also remind you mentioned that August is a really important month that's over forty percent of the third quarter because of how heavy back to school is. So, it's good to have that month behind us.\\nMitch Kummetz: 35:58 Okay. And then Tom on gross margin, you mentioned that you expect gross margin to be below twenty twenty levels for the quarter you just reported. I think you're up around fifty bps ahead of two years ago. So, is the difference all on freight or are there other factors that are putting a little bit more pressure on Q3 versus Q2 on a two year basis?\\nTom George: 36:23 The big difference there is freight. There's a significant amount of freight in the second quarter. I mean, we’re planning on approximately rounded numbers around seven million dollars of additional freight in the third quarter and that has a big impact on the gross margin percentage and a big impact on our operating income results relative to two years ago.\\nMitch Kummetz: 36:47 And just to be clear, is that seven million dollars more than two years ago or seven million more than what you saw in Q2, just help me understand with that?\\nTom George: 36:55 Relative to two years ago and it's a combination of additional vessel charges; it's a combination of airfreight things like that to get the product into our consumer’s hands. So, it's a big difference relative to two years ago. It's just a part of the results as some of the supply chain challenges out there, but we think we've got our hands around it to manage it and we think we've got our exposure included in the back half projection. And we also have some in the fourth quarter as well that have got in our projections just to be cautious.\\nMitch Kummetz: 37:30 Okay. Do you know off offhand what the other freight was in Q2 versus years ago? It was more minimal when we really started to see the backup of the supply chain. And particularly in our branded business, we are having to airfreight product and that's pretty meaningful. I think you’ve seen the container cost go up pretty significantly. So, it's really much more pressure in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter.\\nTom George: 38:02 And Mitch in the second quarter it was almost two million dollars.\\nMitch Kummetz : 38:05 Okay. And then lastly, just on the supply chain, how much longer you think these disruptions will occur? I mean, does this linger in through like the first half of next year? And can you speak to kind of your ability to get product maybe versus some of your competition? I know that for a lot of your brands, you're the largest or one of the larger customers and I'm just wondering, kind of how much of a competitive that advantage that is in the environment of a challenging supply chain?\\nMimi Vaughn: 38:38 Yes. So, we think it's a huge competitive advantage in this environment because is not a new problem. We've been managing through supply chain challenges really since the onset of the pandemic and we've been chasing inventory all the way through, basically last quarter what came in went right back out and yet sales were strong and sales has just continued to be strong. 39:05 So, in our retail business, we're seeing good products flow right now, but it's lower than we would like We have worked on mitigating the risk by ordering higher sales in our projection. So that would help us. And we – so that we can get caught up with some suppliers and we also ordered early and strong, certainly on some core retail style styles. We're an important partner to our brands. They've worked with us as much as possible. Journeys always get more than fair share of products. 39:38 So, we've got the window to re-inventory before holiday and think that it will certainly be challenge to holiday and from what we can see right now, even into the spring possibly, but there's a lot of time between here and there. Factories have been latest situation and there is time to address some of the situation there and then everybody is focused on clearing up some of the problems in the supply chain, but certainly through holiday and perhaps in the spring as well.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:08 Great. Thank you.\\nTom George: 40:11 I think maybe I’d add because we are such a strong strategic partner to our key suppliers, we took advantage of that and ordered early and higher on some key styles for fall.\\nMitch Kummetz: 40:25 Perfect. All right. Thanks. Good luck.\\nMimi Vaughn: 40:28 Thank you.\\nOperator: 40:28 The next question is from the line of Steve Marotta with CL King. Please proceed with your questions.\\nSteve Marotta: 40:37 Good morning, Mimi and Tom, let me offer my congrats to on the second quarter. Can you please remind us the twenty five million dollars to thirty million dollars of cost savings? Can you talk about how that will be realized and what the cadence is there? And if there possible that there's anything behind that you've alluded to in prepared remarks, continued ways of making the business less capital intensive? Thanks.\\nTom George: 41:03 Yes, Steve. So, we're good progress. We've identified twenty that's on an annualized basis and we believe in the back half, we can realize half of that in the form of those items are outlined on the call. Occupancy expenses better selling salary productivity. We have fewer stores. We're going to have savings and depreciation. We've got some procurement initiatives. 41:27 So, roughly half of that twenty million dollars will be realized over the back half. And on the capital light model, I mean, we've got a good wholesale business now. And you can manage your inventories well, our situation we have with the Togast acquisition which is a very capital light model. 41:48 Fewer capital expenditures evolved obviously with the wholesale business because you're not opening up stores. Another driver of the capital light model is our digital business. It's a very variable cost model and we've made investments historically and we're leveraging off those investments going forward. 42:06 So, we feel really good how capital efficient the models come and we'll continue to look at cost savings as well as working on the capital base to continue to drive good returns on invested capital.\\nSteve Marotta: 42:21 That's helpful. And we're seeing across the space when cost savings like this are being implemented, a lot of that is being reinvested in digital marketing and demand creation investments. Is that your intent here as well? Or is it literally a net number coming right out of the P&L?\\nMimi Vaughn: 42:41 So, Steve, certainly, we are investing a lot in digital marketing and in demand creation and we have to do that for both our websites and to our stores. I think the key here is that our e-commerce channel is profitable. And the investments that we're making in digital marketing are actually generating a return. And so we think about that in terms of those channel economics. 43:10 When we think about the brick and mortar side, the challenges there really are to reduce occupancy expense and that's why we've been so focused on that. And if you think about, if we can align occupancy to the appropriate level of traffic right now, and we are spending a little bit more on advertising. So part of the way we're thinking about being able to fund that advertising is through the rent reduction. So, the way we're thinking about this is channel on a channel specific basis.\\nSteve Marotta: 43:46 Very helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator: 43:51 Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\\nJonathan Komp: 43:57 Yeah. Good morning. Thank you and hope everyone is staying safe. I want to just first to follow-up on the supply chain topic. I know, you don't have guidance into next year, but just given the situation with the factories are there scenarios you're hearing from your brands where there might be a shortage of product to sell even more than – more so than what you've faced so far? Just wanted to get your current assessment of the situation with the factory closures and the impact it might have?\\nMimi Vaughn: 44:29 Sure. Thanks for that question, John. I think that when you think about both Journeys and Schuh business, which represent probably eighty percent of our business. The key is that we are diversified across a number of suppliers. And I think that that gives us a real advantage and we've talked a little bit about how important we are to our suppliers, the great partnerships that we have had and the prioritization that we get as a result of how important we are to them. And so the key for us is just the diversification that all suppliers are working hard that they're in a number of different factories and in this case, having multiple brands is a benefit for us.\\nJonathan Komp: 45:16 Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe a bigger picture topic than on really the sustainability of the margin performance and coming off of a first half where you’re typically not very profitable and you were quite profitable this year. How should we think about really the ongoing ability to drive higher margin with everything you've talked about and the increased focus on footwear portfolio, but how are you thinking about what's sort of sustainable versus other benefits that maybe we should expect to continue and how that relates to your broader margin opportunity?\\nMimi Vaughn: 45:59 Sure. So, John, it's a great question. And I think we're so pleased with the results that we had in the first half, there's no question that there were unique factors in terms of the consumer being in a really great place to spend because of stimulus and other government help, there was pent up demand as well. But I think if you look at what specifically we are doing to drive the business. The first thing is around digital and we've talked about how digital is such a profitable part of our overall business. 46:31 We were able to double the size of the e-com business to the course of the pandemic, which means significantly more profit contribution and that'll be in every quarter of the year. We've also talked about rent expense and how important an initiative that is to improve the profitability on the brick and mortar side. And Tom said today, our improvements are just a little under thirty percent and that's compounding on a twenty plus percent last year compounding on eight percent to ten percent in prior years. 47:04 So through a compounding effect, that helps as well. And so we feel like there is a real path to be able with those couple of things plus the growth of the branded side of our business those license brands and this opportunity to re-imagine Johnston & Murphy. We saw the same thing coming out of the great recession. We had a chance to really take the brand up to the next level. And we think there is tremendous opportunity to do that through re-invention of the product, re-invention of the marketing, which is underway right now. 47:40 And so we saw a doubling of Johnston & Murphy’s brand really coming out of the great recession. We think there's an opportunity again to take Johnston & Murphy to the level. So, I think the combination of those three things give us great earnings potential going forward irrespective of the things that were unique to the first half of the year.\\nTom George: 48:03 And I think I’d add again with being a key asset to all the major relevant brands in the retail side of our business. We have the ability because another strength we have is our ability to merchandise product and service product and convert sales, we got the ability, I think everything else being equal to drive some really good gross margins going forward to continue to do that. And with Johnston & Murphy and our license brands business, we have the ability to drive good gross margins and some improvement in those going forward. 48:36 And then just a reminder in the wholesale business on the operating income level, we've got visibility in line of sight that the wholesale business as well is going to be double-digit operating margin going forward.\\nJonathan Komp: 48:50 Okay, great. Just last one for me. The incentive compensation piece, can you just, sorry if I missed this, but can you give us an update where you're tracking this year given the increase in the corporate expenses that we can see and then how should we think about kind of a normalized level after this year? Thank you.\\nMimi Vaughn: 49:12 So, thanks for that question. So, I think an important point to make is that we paid no incentive compensation last year. The way that our program works is that since the pandemic caused substantial disruption, to our operating results even though our team navigated the pandemic so well, constraining expenses and capital and improving liquidity that's because we didn't have year over year improvement, no performance compensation was paid. 49:44 This year, there is a substantial improvement in earnings on a lower capital base and our plan is designed to be highly aligned with shareholder interest as the bonus is generated for the incremental improvement. And so part of what you are seeing in the corporate expense is the booking of bonus, higher level of bonus this year versus two years ago. And we will see a little bit of that in the back half as well, but given the strong performance, that's how the bonus centers up being booked in the second quarter.\\nJonathan Komp: 50:20 Any willingness to quantify just so we can understand the moving pieces in the SG&A?\\nTom George: 50:28 No, we normally don't get into that level at detail, John. I think another point to be made though is, reinforce just a huge year over year improvement we had in economic value added because we did have big year over year improvement earnings on a much lower capital base that this year would be – the bonus related incentive compensation would be higher than we'd normally expect in future years.\\nOperator: 50:58 Thank you. At this time we’ve reached the end of the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mimi Vaughn for closing remarks.\\nMimi Vaughn: 51:05 Great. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of our third quarter.\\nOperator: 51:13 Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

The machine-assisted output provided is partly edited and is designed as a guide.:\\nOperator: 00:05 Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation\\'s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Release and Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded. 00:24 I would now like to introduce your host for today\\'s program, Bill Abler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nWilliam Abler: 00:32 Good morning and thank you for joining us. We will begin today with comments from Entergy\\'s Chairman and CEO, Leo Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO will review results. In effort to accommodate everyone who ask questions, we request to each person ask no more than two question. 00:51 In today\\'s call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, which are set forth in our earnings release, our slide presentation and our SEC filings. Entergy does not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 01:08 Management will also discuss non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in today\\'s press release and slide presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. 01:22 And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.\\nLeo Denault: 01:24 Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share, a very good start for the year. With favorable weather and higher-than-planned retail sales, we are ahead of schedule and solidly on track to achieve our 2022 objectives. And we remain on track for our longer-term outlooks. During the quarter, we continued to execute on both our near and long-term deliverables, just as we have over the last several years. We\\'ve made demonstrable progress on our operational, strategic and financial objectives. 02:03 Operationally, I\\'ll start with some notable regulatory updates. We\\'ve continued to make meaningful progress on storm cost recovery. Texas is done and Louisiana\\'s securitization proceeds from the 2020 storms, plus $1 billion towards IDA will be completed in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana\\'s filing for the balance of IDA will be completed within the coming days, and the Entergy New Orleans filing will follow later this year. A financially strong utility is important for customers. Drew will discuss how securitization progress supports our balance sheet strength. 02:44 As expected, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual formula rate plan which enables continued customer-centric investment and supports our financial outlooks. We\\'re continuing to drive progress on enhancing the resilience of our system, which benefits customers that supports local economic activity as well as our growth plan. Entergy Louisiana completed an important transmission upgrade in the southern part of the state. This $86 million project replaced approximately 80 structures to increase resilience along several miles of critical path transmission in La Pouch Paris, an area that was severely affected by Hurricane Ida last year. To create a solid foundation, the new infrastructure is placed in steel cases. 03:32 The line was built to withstand wind speeds of 150 miles per hour and will improve the resilience of the electric system. Entergy Louisiana also completed a $100 million project in North Louisiana, that positions the region for economic growth. The West Monroe project will provide additional transition capacity, improve reliability and is built to withstand extreme weather events. What that means for customers is enhanced reliability and resilience, better integration of clean generating resources and economic benefits to improved access to lower cost of power. Bottom line, the Entergy team continues to focus on delivering operational excellence across all facets of our business. 04:15 Strategically, I\\'ll start with our merchant business wind down. The last step in our merchant nuclear exit is nearly complete. Palisades is on track to shut down at the end of May with the sale to Holtec following around mid-year. The Palisades team is fishing strong, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated service. We have worked to help employees with their career goals beyond the plant shutdown. Many will continue to work for Entergy at other locations. Some will continue to work for Holtec on decommissioning and others are retiring. 04:50 As you know, DOE recently announced a program to save nuclear plants that are about to shut down. Michigan\\'s Governor issued a letter encouraging utilization of this program to keep Palisades open. We are supportive of federal initiatives to keep nuclear plants operating. However, we are five years into Palisades shutdown process. We\\'re far down the path. There are significant technical and commercial hurdles to changing course at this point. That said, alongside Holtec, we will work with any qualified party that wants to explore acquiring the plant and obtaining federal funding. 05:29 But I do want to be very clear, this does not change our strategy. Entergy is exiting the merchant nuclear business, even if Palisades continues to operate as a part of Entergy. Across all of our operating companies, we continue to be a critical partner to support strong economic development, bringing new businesses, new jobs and new tax base in the communities we serve. For example, Entergy Arkansas, along with the Wynne Economic Development Corporation announced completion of the select site certification for a 37-acre industrial site. Certification streamlines site selection process. Initiatives like this help track new businesses and new projects like the U.S. Steel expansion that was announced earlier this year. 06:17 Over the past five years, our economic development team has helped bring to provision close to 300 announced projects, $42 billion of capital investments, and more than 25,000 jobs. These outcomes have been critical to the economic health of our communities and have been a significant factor in the 9% cumulative industrial sales growth we\\'ve achieved over the past five years. And we continue to expect significant industrial expansion in the next several years. 06:50 As we have discussed, growth from our industrial customers has been driven in large part by cost, labor, logistics and regulatory advantages of the Gulf Coast as well as favorable commodity spreads, which continue to support expansion. Further, the current geopolitical state of the world makes the U.S. and the Gulf Coast in particular, a top choice for stability. 07:15 LNG exporters in the Gulf are being called on to expand production to help reduce Europe\\'s reliance on Russian energy influence. This opportunity represents a win for our customers, communities and owners, not to mention the community. To help support our customers\\' growth and decarbonization objectives are driving progress to expand our renewables footprint. As of today, we have approximately 650 megawatts of renewable capacity in service. 625 megawatts of solar projects approved by regulators and in progress, 725 megawatts of announced projects and up to 4,000 megawatts of RFPs. That\\'s more than half of the 11,000 megawatts of renewable resources in our supply plan through 2030. 08:05 We\\'ve made progress identifying new resources and active RFPs. Since our last call, Entergy Texas concluded evaluations of its 2021 solar RFP. Several resources were selected totaling at least 400 megawatts from owned and contracted proposals. We also made selections from the Louisiana and Arkansas 2021 RFPs earlier in the year. We will provide additional details about the resources selected from these proposals once parties reach definitive agreements. 08:39 We are also soliciting the next round of renewables. Entergy Arkansas recently issued its RFP seeking up to 500 megawatts of renewables to provide cost-effective clean energy, which furthers fuel diversity. Entergy Louisiana also issued notice to proceed with renewable RFP seeking up to 1,500 megawatts in Louisiana. Our customers\\' demand for decarbonization solutions, including green products is not slowing down. The long-term solar market continues to look favorable based on an improving technology curve and higher natural gas price scenarios. However, we fully recognize the near-term cost and schedule pressures that solar projects are facing. 09:25 Supply chain constraints have been exacerbated by the Department of Commerce investigation, which we expect will drive additional delays and the potential for further cost increases. These dynamics are affecting the entire U.S. solar industry, but we are continuing to work through these constraints and are executing on our solar expansion plans. It\\'s important to note that not all of our projects are affected. For example, Sunflower solar in Mississippi, our only owned project coming online this year as its panels on site installation is nearly complete. 10:01 Entergy\\'s owned solar represents a relatively small portion of our three-year $12 million capital plan. Roughly half of owned projects in the three-year horizon are not experiencing impacts of recent marketing constraints. A greater portion of our own projects are expected in the latter half of the decade, which would be past the current working insurance. As we\\'ve said before, we have a large backlog of customer-centric investments with the ability to rotate capital into our plan as an opening presents itself. The bottom line is that we recognize the near and medium-term constraints, still see strong market fundamentals in the long term supports our supply demand and customer objectives. 10:47 On our last call, we told you about the new U.S. Steel expansion. In support of this project and the customers\\' decarbonization goals, Entergy Arkansas filed for approval to acquire the 250 megawatt driver solar facility. Driver solar is an example of how we can partner with customers with their sustainability needs while accelerating the growth of our renewable portfolio in our regulated framework. It also highlights our unique growth strategy to help customers achieve the outcomes they desire, which in turn drives the outcomes for all Entergy’s stakeholders through more jobs and economic activity in our service area, increased capital deployment to support electrification, low growth to offset costs and higher rate of change towards societal decarbonization. 11:38 Nuclear also plays a critical role in our customer decarbonization strategy. Entergy is one of the cleanest large-scale fleets in the nation due to our nuclear fleet. Customers are increasingly highlighting access to carbon renewable resources is key to economic development. They are looking to reduce their carbon footprint and many are indifferent to the type of carbon-free technology. We continue to see examples in the industry that reinforce the need to balance reliability, supportability, environmental sustainability. Entergy\\'s resource planning has always balanced these objectives. Our baseload nuclear plays an important role. 12:20 We have discussed the sizable long-term opportunity for Entergy to help our industrial customers decarbonize and achieve their sustainability unit levels. We had estimate an addressable market of approximately 30 terawatt hours by 2030. To put that into context, that\\'s about 25% of our 2021 total retail sales. That\\'s not to say that we capture the entire market, but we\\'re working how to serve our customers\\' needs and maximize this opportunity. With many carbon reduction goals coming past 2030, achieve greater opportunities beyond the next 10 years. 12:59 Realizing this growth requires significant investment benefits to all stakeholders. This will include meaningful transmission and distribution investments to reliably serve the expansion of our renewable beyond the [indiscernible] in our current 2030 resource. Financially, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Beyond the securitization progress that I mentioned, also significantly reduced our remaining growth equity needs through 2020. Currently, only 25% of the original amount discussed at our 2020 Analyst Day remains. We are on track to achieve steady predictable growth adjusted EPS in dividends, the opportunity to do even better. 13:44 We\\'re very excited about our upcoming Analyst Day on June 16. We\\'ll use that opportunity to provide a closer look into our multiyear strategy and financial plans. That includes our plans to quickly advance resilient investment in our coastal region to lower storm risk for our system, our communities and our customers. And to further expand our renewables portfolio to support our customers\\' decarbonization goals. 14:13 As I said, we\\'ve had a productive start to 2022, and we will continue to successfully achieve the milestones that keep us on track to deliver steady, predictable earnings and dividend growth while maximizing operating efficiencies and investments to make our system most resilient, reliable, clean and affordable it can be. These are the outcomes our customers want by delivering them to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 14:41 Before I conclude, I encourage you to see our recently released 2021 integrated report, \"The Future is on\". The report lays out how we delivered results in 2021, discusses why we\\'re optimistic and excited about Entergy\\'s future. You can see how we integrate the environmental, social and governance objectives to all we do. 15:04 I\\'ll now turn the call over to Drew to review our first quarter results as well as our financial strength and outlooks.\\nAndrew Marsh: 15:12 Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for the first quarter. As you can see on Slide 3, we had adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share. The drivers are straightforward and keep us solidly on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year. We remain confident in our continued success and we are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlook. 15:37 Turning to Slide 4, you\\'ll see the drivers for the quarter. As a result of our continued customer-centric investments, we saw higher levels of revenue as well as higher depreciation and interest expenses. Other O&M increases included higher customer service support and nuclear generation expenses. 15:56 Results for EWC are summarized on Slide 5. The drivers for that business are largely due to the shutdown sale of Indian Point last year. As Leo mentioned, we expect to complete our exit of the merchant nuclear business in the coming months. That will be a major strategic milestone. 16:19 Moving to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was higher than last year at $538 million. Higher utility revenue, lower fuel and purchase power payments and lower pension contributions were the largest drivers. As a reminder, fuel and purchase power payments were significantly impacted by winter storm Uri in 2021. Non-capital storm spending was higher than last year, which provided a partial offset. 16:48 Turning to credit and liquidity on Slide 7. We continue to make progress on securitizations that will strengthen our balance sheet to produce significant cost savings for our customers. Our regulators recognize that financially healthy utilities benefit our customers. To that end, Entergy Texas recently completed securitization for its 2020 storms. And on the day of our last call, the LPSC approved storm recovery and financing for the 2020 storm plus $1 million down payment on Hurricane Ida. 17:22 The approval included replenishment of Louisiana storm escrow to $290 million. Louisiana securitization is expected to be off balance sheet, and we anticipate a $3.2 billion issuance in the coming weeks. Entergy Louisiana plans to file for Ida cost recovery in the coming days, as Leo mentioned, we are targeting to receive proceeds by year-end. The timing of recovery ultimately depend on procedural schedule approved by the commission. 17:53 Entergy New Orleans is seeking approval on the New Orleans City Council to issue $150 million in securitized bonds to replenish the company\\'s storm reserve. If approved, this reserve would enhance credit and ability to respond to potential future storms. In addition, ENO plans to file for Ida cost recovery later this year. Our net liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, being further supported by the tax securitization proceeds received on April 1, and the $3.2 billion Louisiana securitization proceeds once they are received. 18:33 Beyond securitization and liquidity, we continue to focus on resilience, which we will discuss in detail at our Analyst Day. Part of that discussion will include how we are actively applying for federal funding to help pay for resilience investments and mitigate customer insights. 18:53 Looking at Slide 8. It\\'s been approximately two months since our last earnings call. And that time, we have reduced our equity needs by nearly $170 million through our ATM program, with roughly $570 million remaining to be executed between now and the end of 2024. Given the small amount, our plan is to close out the remaining days with the ATM program. 18:53 The four sectors shown on Slide 9 represent nearly half of our industrial sales. And the fundamentals for our industrial customers remained robust in support of continued growth expansion. In addition, expansion of LNG export facilities is coming into spotlight again. Majority of these potential LNG expansion projects will provide and expand Entergy service territories. 19:43 Looking forward to Slide 10, we have a solid base plan with good visibility to achieve our guidance and outlook. We are also monitoring situations surrounding inflation and interest rates. We did not see a meaningful impact on our operational results, and we remain on track to achieve our annual cost estimate. As a result, we are affirming our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range as well as our longer-term outlook. 20:13 As we move towards Analyst Day in New York, in June, we\\'re executing on our operational, strategic and financial objectives and building on a solid foundation. In New York, we\\'ll share our longer-term views on customer-centric investments and financial outlooks. And we look forward to seeing you there. And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions.\\nOperator: 20:37 [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your question please.\\nShar Pourreza: 20:58 Hey, guys.\\nLeo Denault: 21:00 Good morning\\nShar Pourreza: 21:02 Leo, from your prepared remarks, just quickly on Palisades, should we assume you don\\'t want to even remain a short-term owner until the asset is potentially sold? So viability of the asset is really a Holtec question or could there be changes to the Holtec agreement? And maybe just elaborate a little bit on some of the technical challenges like refueling and the capital that\\'s needed to halt decommissioning and can they even be overcome?\\nLeo Denault: 21:32 Yeah. I\\'m nearly not going to, Shar, get into any kind of details about what would or wouldn\\'t work. The technical details, though, around operations, the plant will have to stop operating in May because we\\'ll be out of fuel. We haven\\'t ordered fuel. There\\'s a lot of work that would need to be done at the plants to prepare it to continue to operate beyond that cycle. And we really haven\\'t done the investigation into what that work would be because as you might guess, we have been planning for five years to shut the plant down. We do have an agreement with Holtec and obviously, that has certain features in it that by and large, have all been -- all the conditions have been met, except for the plant is still operating. So it\\'s just a real heavy lift at the last hour. 22:27 And as I said, we couldn\\'t be more supportive of the fact that continuing operation of the country\\'s nuclear fleet is important, the reliability of the bulk electric system and to the ability for us to decarbonize the economy, shutting those plants down is just moving backwards. But -- so I\\'m encouraged by those -- what DOE has got going on for future plants just at this stage with Palisades. It\\'s just a really heavy lift is all we\\'re saying at this moment.\\nShar Pourreza: 23:04 Got it. And then just on credit metrics and equity would you guys potentially trending above your thresholds. Do you see any opportunities to maybe further downsize your $570 million of remaining needs? And as you\\'re kind of getting closer to hitting your credit metrics and prepare to roll forward your capital plan, do you anticipate any improvements in credit metric thresholds especially as the business mix has improved and storm funding is moving closer to resolution? So would like, for instance, an improvement in thresholds, let\\'s say, the 12% to 13% effectively leave you over equitized versus the current projections?\\nAndrew Marsh: 23:45 Yeah, Shar, this is Drew. So in terms of opportunities out there that could continue to change or improve around our credit metrics, obviously. The one that we cited, I think, last -- at the end of last year, I guess, on the last call, was around pension. And certainly, interest rates are changing that pension liability. The returns associated with the trust supporting the pension aren\\'t as good as we were anticipating either all that kind of balancing out. That is something that we are watching closely, if rates continue to stay high and returns turn come back around to -- closer to our expectations, then it could create some more headroom in our credit metric. That\\'s probably the one that we are looking at most closely right now, so we\\'re monitoring that. 24:44 In terms of, obviously, we need to get the securitizations done. We need those to be off sheet as we\\'ve discussed. Those things are going to be big milestones in terms of taking some debt off of our balance sheet. And -- but we\\'re watching that closely as well. Outside of that, our expectations around capital, which obviously also drives our equity needs. Those are things that we\\'re watching closely. We do have some capital associated with solar in the near term. And we can -- I\\'m sure there\\'s going to be a question on the call about that. We can talk about that here in a minute. But we have other capital projects that are waiting in the wings, particularly around resilience. So if there is extra headroom for us because of delays in solar, there\\'s quite a bit of resilience investments that our customers are waiting on and expect us to achieve if there\\'s an opportunity. So I don\\'t anticipate any extra room from the capital side going forward.\\nShar Pourreza: 25:51 Got it. And then just one quick follow-up, if I may, and I appreciate that. It\\'s just on your Analyst Day. I know -- I mean, obviously, you guys talked about resiliency and sort of the green tariffs. Just given the timing of sort of the regulatory initiatives and the technical conferences, I know you obviously highlighted how they would fit in with the Analyst Day. But should we specifically think about the Analyst Day as a roll forward of your base plan and you\\'ll qualitatively maybe discuss these opportunities with some scenario, back testing analysis? Or could we actually see some of the spending actually rolled into the capital plan? Thanks.\\nLeo Denault: 26:28 Well, I think, Shar, we\\'re going to let the punch lines of Analyst Day show up on Analyst Day.\\nShar Pourreza: 26:41 All right. Thanks, Leo. [indiscernible] I get that past.\\nLeo Denault: 26:46 Got it. Thanks.\\nOperator: 26:48 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\\nNicholas Campanella: 26:57 Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks you for taking the question.\\nLeo Denault: 27:01 Good morning.\\nNicholas Campanella: 27:02 So I just wanted to hit solar supply chain risks quick and just the impact. Could you just help us just size the amount of megawatts going into rate base that would potentially be at risk? I think you said roughly half you\\'re secured on over the three-year horizon. So is that like 300 to 400 megawatts? And just to confirm, I heard your last comments right, to the extent that capital shifts, you were just going to backfill that with potential distribution resiliency spend?\\nRoderick West: 27:31 Yeah. And this is Rod. Good morning. From Leo\\'s comments, the near-term risk that we were referring to in terms of existing owned projects was roughly 280 megawatts because we we’re discrete about both -- we\\'re explicit about both West Memphis and Walnut Bend. And so from a megawatt standpoint, they really don\\'t represent a material amount of capacity. So we want to make sure that we put that in some context. And recall, Leo also mentioned the lion\\'s share of our renewable capacity actually shows up on the back end of the decade. So we\\'re calling it out because we recognize that there are some near-term constraints, but they really don\\'t influence, how we\\'re thinking about our build-out.\\nLeo Denault: 28:28 And I think to your last point, Nick, I think Drew mentioned it and I mentioned in the script, we\\'ve got a capital plan and timing that\\'s laid out. We\\'ve got other things waiting in the wings that we could or couldn\\'t accelerate. So the ability to roll something else into the plan that provides benefits to our customers in a different way is always there.\\nNicholas Campanella: 28:56 Absolutely. And then just Drew\\'s comments on inflation. If anywhere, where would you kind of call out that you\\'re kind of seeing the most pressure to the plan? And can you just kind of talk about just the current state of power markets, how you\\'re kind of managing customer bill impacts and the ability to just continue to extend your rate base growth here, perhaps any levers that makes your jurisdiction more unique than others, that would be helpful. Thanks.\\nAndrew Marsh: 29:23 Thanks, Nick. This is Drew. So the way you phrase it was an interesting way to think about it, in terms of putting pressure on the plan. I would actually turn that around and say that it actually enhances the economics of the plan because we think about where the inflation -- what the inflation does to our two central investment themes beyond sort of our base capital in renewables. And in resilience, we think that inflation will actually strengthen the economic case from a customer\\'s perspective to get those things done. Certainly, when you talk about renewables and higher gas prices, there\\'s more economic headroom there right now. And that\\'s accelerating the pressure to get the renewables done. We\\'ve already done a lot of work around improving our gas efficiency with the CCGTs that we\\'ve built historically. And of course, the Orange County Advanced Power Station is out there as well, a high-efficiency unit. So those things are helpful already, but we think it will accelerate our plan around renewables. 30:36 And then, of course, around resilience, a key piece of the plan is the costs associated with putting up hardened lines, distribution lines, transmission lines prior to a storm compared to the cost associated with doing it after the storm. And to the extent that there is inflation, that\\'s going to exacerbate that difference, which is already substantial, and accelerate the need for customers to do it ahead of time in a planful way. And so obviously, those things have an impact on the customer bill, but the alternative of not doing it is an even greater impact on the customer bill. So I think it will drive customers who want to accelerate our plan, which will include renewables and resilience investment.\\nNicholas Campanella: 31:30 That was very detailed. Thanks for the repose. See you in New York.\\nAndrew Marsh: 31:36 All right. Thanks, Nick.\\nOperator: 31:37 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your question please.\\nJeremy Tonet: 31:46 Hi. Good morning.\\nLeo Denault: 31:47 Good morning, Jeremy.\\nJeremy Tonet: 31:49 All right. Just want to come back to DOC a little bit more, if I could. And for 2023 projects, if you could just break down price risk versus timing risk. And do you see C&I demand kind of insulating the project to a degree on both these factors?\\nRoderick West: 32:10 Price risk -- ask the question again, so I want to make sure Drew and I are trying to figure out who\\'s going to answer what part of the question because I know that was a price risk question in there as well.\\nJeremy Tonet: 32:21 Yeah. Just price and timing for 2023 projects.\\nRoderick West: 32:28 So the -- on the projects that we just referenced that being Sunflower, for instance. Sunflower is not at risk. That\\'s one of our own projects. We\\'re expecting that one, as Leo alluded to, to be in service sometime in August. So we\\'re looking good there. The other ongoing projects that we are expecting a bit of delay of the ones I referenced earlier, West Memphis and Walnut Bend. We\\'re working with our BOT partners, both of whom are reputable firms, to lock down both price and schedule certainty. And so there is some risk on both because of the delays for both the supply chain as well as the DOC issues. But beyond that, we\\'ll see if Drew adds anything to that.\\nAndrew Marsh: 33:23 Well, I think the only thing I\\'ll add to what Rod said is that -- and actually, Rod mentioned earlier, the bulk of our expectations are beyond kind of the next two year window. And we\\'ve issued RFPs, the DOC piece accepted. And they\\'re fully aware of all the supply chain concerns and risks. And they are -- prior to the DOC action, they were already aware of tariff activity in that space. So we expect that these folks that we have -- that we are working with coming out of the RFP will be well situated to manage through the current environment and meet the expectations that they put through in the RFPs. 34:13 We expect that the DOC fees will be resolved at some point relatively near term. I mean, I think most of the folks that we\\'ve been engaging with would talk about by the end of the year. But even if it goes a little bit longer, we don\\'t think that, that puts our overall expectations in jeopardy. And certainly, in the near term, as I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of other things. If projects are delayed, there are plenty other things for us to accelerate forward and meet other customer expectations.\\nJeremy Tonet: 34:44 Got it. Thank you for thought. That\\'s helpful. And just kind of pivoting a bit here to nuclear and really small modular reactors, just want to know your thoughts on, I guess, how this could unfold going forward. And we saw one of your peers potentially partnering with the university to build an SMR. Is this something that Entergy would consider doing to demonstrate the viability of the technology? Or any thoughts like us on SMR when and if that could be something that Entergy is really moving more towards or exploring?\\nRoderick West: 35:19 Yeah, Jeremy. We\\'re certainly monitoring what\\'s going on in the SMR space. And as you might guess our nuclear folks are involved in advisory capacities and others with various entities to make sure that we\\'re -- we\\'ve got our finger on the pulse of where that goes. I think that the success of the technology is going to be critical to the decarbonization objectives of the economy. When you think about the ability to build cost competitive, carbon-free, smaller projects that aren\\'t -- the issue, for example, we have with the size of the capital budgets of the existing technologies is that they\\'re as big as the companies that fund them. And that\\'s problematic if you got issues in construction. So we\\'re very excited about that opportunity, when and how it fits itself into our needs, we\\'re continuing to monitor and it\\'s a little bit difficult to say. But certainly, I think we should all be -- room for that technology to take root. 36:31 We are spending, I know probably more of our efforts in the hydrogen space because of the unique position that we have in the hydrogen market with producers, consumers, stores, transported all in the heart of our service territory. So there\\'s a unique advantage there. But it doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not staying involved in what the SMR technology could do for us and for the economy in general.\\nJeremy Tonet: 36:59 Got it. It\\'s very helpful, I leave it there. Thanks.\\nRoderick West: 37:03 Thank you.\\nOperator: 37:05 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your question please.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 37:13 Hey. Good morning, guys and Drew long time no see. Just -- other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up from my side. Just can you confirm that the storm Ida balance of costs, which you haven\\'t received sort of regulatory approval for? Does that still sit at $1.7 billion? I believe that was the number as of the end of the fourth quarter call. So if you could just confirm that or update us on where that sits now?\\nAndrew Marsh: 37:47 Yeah. So the answer is the total cost estimate for that storm is still at $2.7 billion in total, $1 billion of that is in the first securitization we expect to price in the next few weeks. And the balance would be towards the end of the year. The full $2.7 billion will be part of our filing that we are making in the next couple of days. We still be -- just to clarify, we have to get approval for the full amount to get cost recovery for the full amount. That hasn\\'t -- $1 billion down payment is not pre-approval of those costs. It\\'s just -- it\\'s a prefinancing.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:29 I see. So essentially, you\\'ll be seeking approval for the full $2.7 billion and the $1 billion that you\\'ve gotten already will be applied towards it. Is that the right way to think about it?\\nAndrew Marsh: 38:41 That is correct.\\nDurgesh Chopra: 38:43 Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the call today. Thanks guys.\\nAndrew Marsh: 38:49 Thank you.\\nOperator: 38:49 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your question please.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 38:57 Hi. Good morning, team and thanks for the opportunity here. Congratulations on continued results. If I can, just to focus on the first quarter and some of the dynamics here. Can you comment a little bit on the industrial demand and the 6.5% in the first quarter here? And how do you see this trend through the balance of the year as you think about it, especially given the potential for export-oriented industries to do particularly well here? And could you talk also in tandem at the same time about some of those trends that you observed specifically around accelerating customer desire for renewables? You had specifically identified at the start of this year, a number of very large customers. But I have to imagine, based on your comments already that there are actually several other larger customers that you\\'re talking to.\\nAndrew Marsh: 39:46 Yes. So this is Drew. I\\'ll take the first part, and I\\'ll turn the second part over to Rod. And so certainly, in terms of the sales expectations, we did have higher-than-anticipated industrial sales in the quarter. A lot of -- most of it was actually more or less in line. In fact, I would say, compared to our expectations, obviously, refiners, seeing very high crack spreads performed well. We did have some unplanned outages in some of the chemical and petrochemical space, which pulled us down a bit. And then there are unplanned outages for our Cogent customers, and that actually lifted us back up. So that Cogent piece was actually fairly strong, where there were a number of outages that helped lift is back up. 40:33 I would say that the other part, the unplanned outages for our regular customers, that was fairly significant too. So I mean, all in all, it\\'s probably about what we were expecting but a little bit higher. And as we sort of go through the balance of the year, and I showed you the statistics on one of the slides or some of our key industries, we do expect them to continue to run at high utilization rates. Aside from planned or unplanned outages, they\\'re going to try and trim those off as much as they can to run as hard as they can, given the current commodity environment. 41:10 And I will also say LNG wasn\\'t on that page, but LNG utilization rates are extremely high as well. So I\\'ll turn it over to Rod to talk about other...\\nRoderick West: 41:22 I was only going to elaborate on the LNG piece, and I\\'m not going to, Leo\\'s point, give any pouch lines around Analyst Day because we\\'ll give our point of view on our five-year outlook. But we are seeing greater interest in signing offtake contracts, which would support our view on expansion in the LNG space. We\\'ll leave it to our customers to lead that conversation, but we\\'ll note empirically that 85% of the projects are under FID consideration in the LNG space are in Entergy service territory. And so it just further supports our point of view that we have a unique growth story that is our customers have a unique growth story. And our ability to serve their expansions in addition to their -- helping them meet their ESG objectives remains a growth opportunity for us for us, and we still remain bullish about it.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:29 Excellent. And then just one other nuance here. I\\'m just seeing a lot of headlines here on insurance costs. I\\'m sure you guys have seen the headlines in Florida, but also in Louisiana itself, especially as it relates to catastrophic storms. Can you comment about any potential pressures from an inflationary perspective on your business specifics?\\nLeo Denault: 42:49 You\\'re talking about insurance specifically, Julien?\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 42:51 Yeah. I mean I was thinking about insurance specifically, obviously, a broader backdrop here, but insurance seems to be getting headlines here outside of the utility space of very late.\\nLeo Denault: 43:05 Okay. So I\\'ll -- now insurance is -- we aren\\'t allowed to ensure our poles and wires. So that hasn\\'t been a driver on that particular space. Just like everybody else, we have seen broad insurance premium pressure. And so we are working through that regardless of whether it\\'s property or general liability or what have you, et cetera. So we are cyber. We\\'re working through that and making sure that we continue to meet our overall O&M expectations on a go-forward basis. But that\\'s, as you said, it\\'s sort of symptomatic of a broader perspective around inflation. We certainly have seen inflation in the fuel space. We\\'ve talked about that a little bit. We are working with our stakeholders on how to manage that in the near term. I think long term, that is a commodity which cycles, and we expect the wildcatter spirit that\\'s out there and the oil patch to take over at some point and help bring prices back down again. 44:13 As far as sort of inflation in the capital space, we talked about that a little bit with solar, we\\'re seeing it in other materials and some of our other capital projects. But I think the thing to keep in mind on that is, we\\'re seeing it for our current marginal capital projects, but they\\'re being added to a much larger rate base, which is already invested in and fixed. And so it\\'s a much smaller piece of the overall rate base when you added in. And so the pressure from a customer bill perspective is not that great. Certainly, as I mentioned, the fuel piece is something we\\'re paying close attention to. And as far as just other operating costs, we haven\\'t seen much pressure as of late. But we\\'re certainly mindful of that, and we are driving our continuous improvement efforts to make sure that we stay ahead of that on an ongoing basis.\\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: 45:11 Got it. It doesn\\'t sound like it\\'s an outsized impact to you all here. It sounds like you guys have it under control. And also it sounds like a pretty good update here at this Analyst Day. So we\\'re going to stay tuned. Thank you, guys.\\nLeo Denault: 45:23 Thanks, Julien.\\nOperator: 45:26 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\\nSteve Fleishman: 45:32 Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just on the resilience plans that you have talked about. I think going back to last year, you talked about kind of having discussions with key stakeholders and the like. And just -- can you give any sense of how those have gone? And is there any -- do you get a sense of urgency from people on this? Just any color there?\\nRoderick West: 46:03 Thanks, Steve. It\\'s Rod. Good morning. We have just completed the analytics around the risk scenarios, probably consequence of storms. And we\\'re in that evaluation phase of the CapEx investment scenarios. And so what you\\'re alluding to is the beginning of the formal and sometimes informal technical and stakeholder conferences and conversation. That actually begins in earnest tomorrow as we begin the conversation in New Orleans. And so the feedback loop is just beginning, and we\\'ll have more color around it at Analyst Day. I can tell you that we have certainly had informal conversations as we were beginning the analytics. And there\\'s a keen interest in understanding, one, what\\'s our point of view around the risk and the benefits of acceleration. Obviously, in the current economic environment, most of the stakeholders, customers and regulators and others alike are always going to be interested in how we think through the cost and bill impact. 47:29 And so we\\'re beginning, but I\\'m expecting a very active engagement from the stakeholders as we move through New Orleans. Certainly, Louisiana in route to what we believe to be our first formal filings in that July time frame for the City of New Orleans. And then the state of Louisiana certainly around that time frame, but not just likely later. Even in Texas, Steve, we have -- we\\'ve begun dropping ideas around how they ought to think about resiliency. They -- certainly, their point of view might be a little different in terms of the sense of urgency that you alluded to than say, Louisiana and New Orleans. But we certainly have their attention, especially given the role of our Texas service territory in the industrial growth space. And their interest in resiliency as well. But short answer is we\\'re just beginning, but more to say about it at Analyst Day, Steve.\\nSteve Fleishman: 48:38 Okay. So it sounds like at the very least, you\\'ll have better data scenarios for the Analyst Day of what different options are. And obviously, the results will be over time, depending on what customers states want. Okay. Thank you.\\nRoderick West: 48:57 Thank you.\\nOperator: 49:01 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your question please.\\nJonathan Arnold: 49:08 Good morning, guys. One question, just -- can you give us a little bit of a sense, you\\'ve alluded to being conscious of commodity and gas prices and obviously, take your points about the longer-term benefits of some of your investment plans. But what is the sort of current build trajectory that you see over the coming months? And maybe we could just sort of focus in on that.\\nAndrew Marsh: 49:41 Sure. This is Drew. So in the near term, of course, it depends on the jurisdiction. The one that you\\'re probably most interested in, of course, is Louisiana and the securitization costs associated with that. It will depend on what the final pricing is of those securitization bonds, but somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% once all those securitization costs are into bills. And I think that includes a little bit of uptick in the interest rates that we see. So obviously, our customers are expecting that. They know it\\'s out there. So we\\'re managing through that with our stakeholders. And the bulk of that has already been approved by the commission. And so it\\'s headed forward as we\\'ve discussed. 50:36 The gas price piece -- that reflects -- it depends on the jurisdiction, but it generally gets into bills fairly quickly in Louisiana, Texas, New Orleans. There is a little bit of hedging that goes on in Mississippi and Louisiana can help that, but it\\'s pretty small. But they\\'re used to the gas price volatility. Nevertheless, we\\'re continuing to work through it, the continuous improvement program that we have as part of that. We also have levelized billing programs for customers that allow them to manage through their bill and avoid some of that volatility. So those are examples of things that we\\'re doing to try to help customers go through that. And then over time, I think gas prices are a little bit above where our previous expectations were, but they\\'re still in a manageable range. And as we said and as you were alluding to, Jonathan, the investments that we intend to make should help with gas price risk and inflation risk on a longer-term basis.\\nJonathan Arnold: 51:51 When you say over time, Drew, you\\'re talking about sort of further out on the curve, right? Can you frame for us what the sort of 2022 impact on sort of top of the securitization might end up being on Louisiana customers, for example?\\nAndrew Marsh: 52:08 On 2022, yeah, it\\'s going to be a portion of what I was explaining earlier because it\\'s not always the overall securitization costs. So maybe about two-thirds of that. So about a 5% or 6% increase by the -- once those get into the bills this year -- later this year.\\nJonathan Arnold: 52:30 And then I think the commodity piece is incremental to that? Or is that included in that number? I guess my...\\nAndrew Marsh: 52:36 No. The commodity piece -- you\\'re talking about gas prices? Yes. I think a general rule of thumb around there is about $1 per MMBtu is about a 3% to 4% increase in gas prices, if that\\'s sustained over a year. Of course, we haven\\'t seen that yet, but that would be kind of the thought there.\\nJonathan Arnold: 53:00 Okay. Thank you for that color. If I could just on one other thing. When I look at your slide with the progress against guidance in the few buckets like utility O&M and the interest line and then also this is parent line that\\'s now there. It seems like you\\'re tracking -- you\\'ve had more than a quarter\\'s worth of the pressure you were expecting from the year in first quarter. I know that other taxes piece, you said would be kind of more front-end loaded. But is that timing across the board? Or are these some things that are building, but then you hope that kind of the sales uptick is going to hold your homeless effective? I was just curious if you can frame that a bit for us.\\nAndrew Marsh: 53:44 Yeah. Sure. So in terms of O&M, I think in the first quarter, you\\'re talking to the timing elements. We are on track for our expectations for the balance of the year. And in terms of the interest expense element, we are seeing some interest expense that\\'s a little bit higher than we would expect to stick as we go through the course of the year. But there\\'s also some timing elements in that sort of category that we are seeing in the first quarter that will turn back around. So you\\'re not seeing all of the interest expense in the first quarter and it goes away. It actually is going to be building over the balance of the year, but there are some timing elements in the first quarter that will turn around. But I think those are the two things that are going on.\\nJonathan Arnold: 54:30 Thank you for that. Thanks. Good luck. Look forward to [indiscernible].\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:32 All right. Thank you.\\nOperator: 54:34 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.\\nJames Thalacker: 54:43 Hi. Good morning, everyone.\\nAndrew Marsh: 54:44 Good morning, James.\\nJames Thalacker: 54:47 Just a real quick clarification just post Julien\\'s question. With a slightly better sales outlook you guys have, have the drivers related to mix changed materially, Ergo? Is this really being driven more by a more robust C&I sales? Or are you seeing higher demand across all classes despite an increasing trend for return to work at this point?\\nRoderick West: 55:11 This is Rod. I think the short answer is it\\'s been actually going the way that we expected. With residential demand trailing off as our residential customers are going back to work, school and kind of a pre-COVID life. And the growth story being driven by the C&I space that you alluded to. So from our vantage point, we\\'re actually tracking according to plan there with a little bit of robustness in the C&I space, but that\\'s about it.\\nJames Thalacker: 55:52 Okay. Great. And just following up on Jonathan\\'s question too, just to clarify, the 10% increase you\\'re talking about, that\\'s in -- that\\'s 10% increase across total retail sales, correct, in Louisiana?\\nRoderick West: 56:08 Yes.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:10 Is there somewhat of a skew across -- from a rate design basis like, is there a rough idea of like what that could mean for residential versus commercial versus industrial? Might be a little too granular at this point. I can follow up offline.\\nAndrew Marsh: 56:27 Yeah. I think Bill can cover that for you offline because I don\\'t -- I can\\'t actually answer that off the top of my head. There is a difference, of course. There\\'s a big chunk of distribution costs and that is going to go mostly to residential and commercial customers, not as much on industrial customers.\\nJames Thalacker: 56:45 Okay. Great. I’ll follow up with Bill. Thanks so much.\\nOperator: 56:50 Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your question please.\\nRoss Fowler: 56:57 Good morning. How are you? So if I think about your base capital plan at $12 billion. And I think if I remember correctly from -- we\\'re talking about $5 billion to $15 billion of potential incremental CapEx. I just wanted to understand or comment around federal funding. Is that $5 billion or $15 billion of incremental CapEx sort of net of that number or would any federal funding net that number down, whatever that number happens to be depending on the long-term opportunity set?\\nAndrew Marsh: 57:32 Yes. The federal funding would be outside of anything that we\\'ve got in our projections. So the $5 billion to $15 billion, that isn\\'t over the next three years, that goes out through 2030. Just to be clear on that. And it\\'s really an acceleration of work that we could do over time based on the fact that we might take things that are working today, but are old standard and pull them down and put up something of a new standard. It\\'s that kind of work that we\\'d be looking at. So any kind of federal funding would be used to offset the cost. And then that provides headroom that you could potentially accelerate more. 58:16 So one way to think about it, Ross, would be if you were going to spend $10 billion, and then all of a sudden, you got $1 billion worth of federal funding, we may spend $11 million, would be one option to be able to -- and you get it for effectively $11 billion worth of resilience for $10 billion number. So that\\'s the way we would think about it and likely propose it.\\nRoss Fowler: 58:40 Okay. That\\'s the way I understood it. I just want to make sure I was understanding that correctly. And then maybe longer-term, as you get to the credit metrics you need on the balance sheet you want on the balance sheet. If you think about your 5% to 7% EPS growth. As you execute some of these opportunities and maybe grow rate base faster than that in the long term, but there might be an equity need attached to the capital. So does that bring your EPS growth rate back down. What -- how do you think about rates on bills and your long-term growth rate? In other words, is the $5 billion to $15 billion thinking about extending that 5% to 7% or maybe even the upper end of that 5% to 7% for a longer period of time? Or is there actually an opportunity to accelerate that 5% to 7% longer term given bill pressure and other things that might happen with inflation?\\nLeo Denault: 59:33 Yeah. I guess I\\'ll kind of sum it up this way. We have a significant amount of growth opportunities because of the growth needs of our customers. The resilience spend is certainly one of those areas. The acceleration of renewables ahead of the schedule that we\\'re on to meet decarbonization goals of our current customers as they want to get outsized access to clean resources could accelerate renewables at the same loan growth. The expansion of our industrial base is a growth opportunity, just the growth that we\\'re seeing, as we\\'ve talked about, the utilization rates are high, inventories are low, all the commodity spreads are in the right place. That leaves itself pretty ripe for expansion. And that\\'s what we\\'re seeing as we have dialogue with our customers going forward. 60:31 And then the electrification side of things where they\\'re going to take existing load or existing processes that are not electrified and electrify them, and that creates load growth. So there\\'s all kinds of avenues for growth in customer demand for a higher level or a different level of service that could provide capital opportunities for us. I would say at a minimum, that just makes the runway pretty long for us in terms of where we are with the current outlook. Our objective would certainly be to have a better outlook going forward and balance all the things that you were talking about. The growth in sales, the growth in investment, and the growth in financing needs and balance all that out in a way that creates a different trajectory for us going forward. 61:18 And I think our customers are going to demand the types of investments we need to make that happen. But that\\'s in the future. So I think all of those combined certainly bode well for a continuation of the growth that we\\'ve seen and demonstrated over the course of the last several years, pretty much like clockwork. And then I think our objective and the work we need to do is to find a way to make it better.\\nRoss Fowler: 61:46 All right. That’s perfect. Thank you for that. Look forward to seeing you in June.\\nLeo Denault: 61:51 All right. Thank you, Ross. Look forward to seeing all of you as well.\\nOperator: 61:55 Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\\'s program. I\\'d like to hand the program back to Bill Abler for any further remarks.\\nWilliam Abler: 62:05 Thank you, Jonathan and thanks to everyone for participating this morning. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q is due to the SEC on May 5, and provides more details and disclosures about our financial statements. Events that occur prior to the date of our 10-Q filing that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet would be reflected in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, as a reminder, we maintain a web page as part of Entergy\\'s Investor Relations website called Regulatory and Other Information, which provides key updates of regulatory proceedings and important milestones on our strategic execution.

Throughout this recorded presentation, investors will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. The company may not be in a position to answer every question received during the meeting itself. However, the company will review all questions submitted today, I published responses where it's appropriate to do so. 0:27 Before we begin, I’d like to submit the following part and if you'd give that your kind attention, I'm sure the company will be most grateful. I now like to hand it over to Jaco Prinsloo CEO, good afternoon to you sir.\\nJaco Prinsloo: 0:40 Good afternoon. And thank you very much for the opportunity to engage with you, again and for first having to thank you for our interim results for the period. It's also a pleasure and I think the feedback we get for this platform is very valuable. So myself and Lewanne Carminati CFO will be taking you through the key aspects of our results in this presentation, and hopefully have some time for Q&A afterwards. 1:12 So let me just jump straight into the overview of the financial year or the year. I think, first of all, from a production perspective, we were 11% down on the ounces on the corresponding period. But I think it's important to note that, we still had a solid production performance and the factors that contributed to the level production are basically isolated to two incidents, so the first one being the temporary production suspension at Lesedi. We announced just after our financial year, last year, and then subsequent water shortages and then secondly, the lower PGM Feed grades of open costs raw material we receiving at the point of operation particular and that affects both the PGM Feed grades and recovery efficiencies. So those two explain basically the production deterioration and I will cover that a bit more in detail a bit more later. 2:12 Important want to notice that the PGM Feed Tons a 17% down on the corresponding period is primarily because of the Lesedi county just lost to all the other operations met or exceeded their production performance for the period. So as I said, overall, quite encouraging that they managed to mitigate a lot of the impact. From the financial perspective, obviously, as we've seen in the last financial year, we are quite heavily impacted by the movements in the PGM price. And in this instance, with a PGM also process deteriorated is 7% period and period. The combined to the lower PGM production, my fortune revenues and profits were quite a bit lower. Nevertheless, it was still a solid performance generating still good cash and profits. And that enabled us to be able to stall the clear windfall dividend for the period of 2.25p that we would aim to pay in April. That's following on from 4p and your dividends were paid in December and also 3.75p we've paid in April last year. 3:21 So last one on the slide, which we will cover in more detail later in the presentation is obviously the group cash cost being up quite a bit in the remaining area of focus. And because of our large, fixed costs portion of our costs and the answers being down, our cash costs are quite a bit higher, and remain the focus here. And we'll deal a bit more of it later in the presentation. 3:49 I think a lot of people are familiar with location of operations, this just gives us the brief overview for anybody who's new on the – on our company, that they are to pause our presentation, you'll see like in the project when we talk about projects and growth as well. We primarily have six Chrome, beneficiation and PGM plants – processing implants that are located on the Eastern Western Limb of this African bushveld complex respectively. And that's the those are the operations currently generating all our revenue and profits. 4:25 And then secondly, to the top of the picture there in the middle North is the to mining right areas that we have, or a number of mining right here is the one is the Grasevally Chrome Mining project that is within announced in recent announcements that is a sale that's in progress. And then the other two is the Northern Limb and Volspruit projects, which we'll deal with later in the presentation. 4:54 Looking at the production profiles, and I've mentioned earlier that, we fundamentally this year saw their production – and the lower production primarily because of the impact of the Lesedi and I'm wondering you can see the yellow and blue bars being smaller for 2022. We are ever looking at commissioning the Lesedi MF2 later and we will during the day towards the end of this quarter, to ramp up and stabilize during Q4. And we are looking at commissioning Tweefontein to later in this calendar year. So in the first half of the new financial year, and those 2 projects will help to ramp our profile up again, combined with us addressing the water issues and Lesedi, which I'll deal with in the next slide just now. I think also just worth noting on this little split is we show the these are 4E answers we're dealing with. And you saw our 4E Prill Split there on the side. But I have also just put a little table in on the slide that compares it to 6E. And you can see for instance for this period, the 32,400 ounces equates to about 41,860 ounces. And the only reason we doing that is for you to get an idea some of our peers and other companies in the industry announced only 6E ounces and then you can see what the ratio of the 2E is. 6:25 So if we look at more detail around the Lesedi problem and as I said with announced early last year, okay. After our financial again to the problems we've had, we've managed to successfully implement a number of mitigating measures that helped us to reinstate integrity of the dam to the current state where it's not a concern all the parameters are falling within our acceptable design and operating parameters. We have our ever from a production point of view incurred longer downtime than anticipated and the primary reason for that is when we started remining and recommissioning feed to the operation. At the end of September last year, we've had significant water shortages and also because we depositing on a temporary emergency tailings in the deposition facility, our return water rates, the recovery rates were lower than normal. And therefore it exacerbated the water problem and we had significant production downtimes at that operation. 7:30 However, we have subsequently installed an additional water supply through new boreholes that was installed at Lesedi and also we have just commenced commissioning of the new tailings facility at Lesedi. It's been in construction during the last year and you can see the bottom right picture there. It's a state of the art tailings facility with suitable storage return-water dam [Indiscernible] water-dam facilities that will be able to manage the water a lot more efficiently going forward. 8:03 So overall, we believe that we will see Lesedi coming back to more sustainable production and from Q4 obviously in this current quarter January and February still partially impacted taking into account in our forecast for the year. When we look at the other two areas of focus last at the moment, the lower on grades and as I explained in previous announcements since our host mine scaled down some of the underground operations in early 2020. We have seen quite a reduction in PGM Feed Grade to our main way operation in particular, with PGM Feed 30% to 40%, lower. And various sampling campaigns investigations has been performed during the period to try and address that to those months. Obviously, the current mine is don't do PGM grade control at all, the primary current mine is because it's not the business and we from Sylvania point of view and our relationship with those mines employ external geologists, the mining engineers, specifically the focus on the PGM grade occurrence on the various sources, so that we can work with those found to try and improve the blending ratio to our operation. And we anticipate an improvement in the feed grades to come. 9:26 The last one at the bottom of the slide is water constraints and operations and it ties into what I've just discussed on the Lesedi. But water generally in areas of the program, and we've also received on the piece of might have questions for investing meet quite a few questions relating to water. So I think it's worth maybe just looking at that what we're doing. They are various initiatives we have implemented since 2019 and that was really the first year where we had significant downtime between Mooinooi and Lesedi. We've had significant additional [Indiscernible] recover water around our own properties. We've also very innovative plan that employed a company called water enters to scavenge and reduce seepage water from around the perimeter of the tailings dams that added significantly to our water supply and helped us to balance the water better. And then finally, as I said, looking at better return-water facilities surround our designs in the new building facilities. We also continue to engage with our host minds with neighbouring minds with water specialist in the area to not only look on our own properties, but also conducting water studies, underground water surveys are now surrounds and there's a couple of projects that could potentially improve the long-term situation of water. So I think if it wasn't for the tailings dam issues at Lesedi, the impact would not have been so pronounced. But it is still a focus area for us in terms of long-term security. 11:01 From opportunity perspective, obviously we've – we quite happy that we are able to commission our Lesedi bond soon the MF2 which is the secondary milling and flotation MF2 as you would remember, this secondary billing and flotation. blonds is outflow from the very successful rollout of our Project ECHO or that we have rolled out MF2 plants to [Indiscernible] respectively, and which have been running very successfully for a number of years now. Lesedi is the next one to follow and then Tweefontein is also an execution to be done later in the year. And as I said earlier, those plants will contribute giving an experience. 11:47 Also is progress on the additional third party tenants material and that is specifically looking at higher grade available tailings for 3rd parties that we can blend into our existing infrastructure on the one end and also the new opportunities on the other end. Obviously, the existing ones we have is some smaller few sources to the tune of 2,000 ounces to 3,000 ounces a year we can add that's associated with some of our eastern operations. But then we also have various sampling campaigns where we continue to engage with the bodies to bring in secure more material online. 12:22 Fine chrome recovery is again, it's a project we've defined in terms of Unlocking Potential in otherwise sterilized resources with a PGM grade is too low in some of our old dumps. So instead of walking away from those dumps, because the PGM grade is low, there's lots of significant Chrome and there is a mutually beneficial business case for us and those mines to recover that Chrome and once you recover the significant amount of Fine Chrome you also upgrade the PGM to a stage where it is worth picking it another time for your operation. So therefore extending life of mine and we continue to focus on those projects. Lenox in particular is an example where this would work very well. 13:04 And then just finally, we manage to maintain a strong cash reserves and we continuously balance our existing capital projects to stay in business and interim expansion versus the need for future projects, looking at creating value for shareholders and the different instruments, and also then it gives us the advantage of having cash available in the event of opportunistic M&A. 13:34 So I'm gonna end over to Lewanne, just to take us through the financials and then we'll do a bit more some of the projects that the inbound the market and I'll do the details for us afterwards. So thank you very much.\\nLewanne Carminati: 13:49 Thanks, Jaco. Often, running brief through the financial information for the six months to 31 December 2021, net Revenue for the period was $69 million, and includes 4E revenue and by-products as well as base metals and the sales adjustment for the period. I'll go into the revenue a little more detail in the next slide. Cost of sales includes both direct and indirect costs of production, plus non-cash items, such as your depreciation, whichever has payments and we had provision movements. We've split out the Mineral Royalty Tax on the base of the statements given the increase in Royalty Attracting ounces, resulting in a much higher cost is typically disclosed. And then other expenses are [Indiscernible] G&A in South Africa, Mauritius, Bermuda and the UK and then a portion of that is also realized for its adjustments on revenue. 14:56 Lastly on this slide, is the income tax expense, which includes income tax that's payable on profits in South Africa at 28% deferred tax movements dividend withholding tax, which is declared on dividends declared by the South African operating entity upwards to the parent entity. And this brings us to a net profit of $24 million balance for the period. 15:26 Looking at revenue and net revenue is down 19% on the comparative prior period. The lower Basket price accounted for a decrease of $6.6 million and the lower ounce production a decrease of $9.3 million. The percentage revenue contribution for each of the six key metals is shown in the pie-chart in the bottom right of this slide. Platinum contributed 23% of revenue, which equates to about $15 million. Platinum 20%, Palladium 15%, which is about $10 million, and rhodium at 56% of our revenue at the $9 million. Ruthenium and iridium make up the balance of the six year revenue or $5 million. 16:10 The sales adjustment for the period is calculated on the answers that were delivered in the last three months of the 2021 financial year and recorded at the last price received in June, but only invoiced in July August and September. So the pullback in the rhodium price in September had a negative impact on our revenue for the past 6 months. 16:35 The SDO operating cash cost per ounce increased 32% to $815 per ounce compared to H1 2021. A portion of this increase is due to the strengthening of the average rent dollar by 7% [Indiscernible]. So if you look at the cost in Rand terms, our cash was increased 23% with the main contributors being that 15% increase in electricity mining costs that were higher due to the subsidy paid to the host mine and as we said at year end results presentation was on a trial basis and has subsequently stopped so that that cost will be reduced. 17:16 We had higher consumable costs which are incurred as a result of more wrong material at the Lenox bronze. annual payroll increases were effective in July 2021 and then we had to higher maintenance costs as a result of course a material feed being processed to some of the clients. Converting at an average exchange rate of 15.29 to the dollar and forecasting a full year costing at around $790 per ounce. The 2023 and 24 cost per ounce is an illustrative guide based on our forecast answers as well as the current exchange rates. 18:00 Then the table on the right just gives a breakdown of the five largest direct costs of operations for the six months with employee cost accounting for 32% of total direct operating costs and then followed by GTT. The group EBITDA as with revenue and cost per ounce, the EBITDA was impacted by lower ounce production and lower process with a period as well as slightly higher costs. The full year EBITDA is estimated at just about $100 million and has been adjusted for the revision in production for the financial year, again between 2023 and 2024 EBITDA estimates are an illustrative God based on the current exchange rates, and spot prices in February 2022 and the higher focus answers produced following the commissioning of the Lesedi, MF2 and Tweefontein. 18:59 Our cash flow was remained strong despite the production challenges. For the reporting period operating profit before capital was $36.4 million working capital increased $6.7 million, net interest income of $700,000 and we paid our taxes of $12 million. Investing Activities comprise capital strings of $6.1 million on operations, capital projects and SIB and then $1.3 million on exploration. 19:32 The company also spent $2.4 million on share buybacks and paid out $14.6 million in December for the annual dividends for financial year 2021. Looking forward to the second half of the financial year, cash flows will be impacted by the ounce production and Basket price. The higher voice get price in February will have a favorable effect on cash flow for answers produced in November December. Higher capital spend and outflow is four possible growth projects income tax and mineral water tax payable June will affect the cash flow for the next 6 months as well. And then lastly, the payment of the windfall dividends in April and any other potential cash capital returns to shareholders expense. 20:24 There hasn't been too much change to the capital forecast for the full year compared to the presentation in September. We incurred little additional capital on the temporary tailings facility at Lesedi and much of this will be reallocated to the new facility. The full cost remains at around $22 million for the full year and $16 million for 2023. And this includes the MF2 for Lesedi and Tweefontein and then the three tailings dams which are inside. 20:58 On exploration capital for 2022 is the drilling program that commenced last year. As we still awaiting the final results on this program, which are due July this year. We haven't planned any further exploration capital and that will be dealt with in the new financial year. 21:23 And looking at our ESG. In our 2021 annual reports replenished our heart rates ESG report confirming our commitment to ESG, and sustainable mining based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And each reporting period we aim to provide updates and on our progress whilst aligning our ESG risks, opportunities and exposure areas to the company's values, as well as the ICMM guiding principles. 21:54 The very nature of our business reducing the impact of mineral waste – or impact that mineral waste dumps have on the environment. The reworking of the dams and read depositing on the same footprint for more enhanced facilities reduces the environmental impact of these dams and also reduces the potential secrets or spillage as we continuously monitor and upgrade these facilities. 22:20 In addition to this, the company also makes financial provision for final rehabilitation of these facilities, and we just commissioned the trial project to revegetate the dumps with suitable plants and seeds and ultimately creates a natural habitat to attract insects and small animals. But they stopped studying for this was completed during the reporting period and a start at one of our clients has already been allocated to start the trial. 22:48 The main focus of the company with regard to our carbon transition currently is energy optimization and investigating renewable energy. So when is current emission calculations are based on Scope 1 and 2 emission sources from Eskom diesel generation and diesel used and are below acceptable thresholds? 23:10 Management intends to focus on reducing energy intensity through optimization of processes, the possible reduction and replacement of Scope 1 and 2 energy sources with greener alternatives, and ultimately the recovery of emissions. This is a long-term goal, but small projects already in place that will be implemented, such as power factor correction installed at 83% of their plans, new lighting installations utilizing lower low energy led, and then studies have been initiated at two plans to assess the suitability of possible feeding plans to supplement daily power usage. 23:53 Under the social banner, the company grew its local community employment by 27%. With funded or are finding a number of learnerships or work based learning programs. There was a small increase in women in mining during the reporting period and company aims to increase this even further going forward. We've continued our community projects with focus on schools feeding schemes, business development of community businesses and awareness programs, including World AIDS Day, 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children, and all the day to name a few. The company also launched an employee wellness program post period end, we identified the need for this program optimizing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of people in general. The program goes beyond COVID and provides unlimited telephone counselling covering work, personal emotional trauma, dealing with illness and dependency, and also provides financial planning advice face to face counselling with necessary and legal advice. 25:07 In respect of safety, although the lost time injury frequency rate reduced in comparison to the prior financial year, the company did have one [Indiscernible] employee of a contractor onsite [Indiscernible]. The plants do run regular safety campaigns, and they are well supported by employees and contractors. And the government that company is in the process of formalizing its ESG reporting Toolkit. In addition, the company is continuously updating and improving its existing policies Germany's with stakeholder expectations, and to ensure legal compliance. We had no section 54 or section 55 stoppages are instructions from the Department of mineral resources and in terms of our economic contributions in South Africa, the company paid $377 million to supplies in South Africa and both OpEx and CapEx, ZAR 155 million was paid to employees and in taxes and contributions on behalf of employees. And ZAR 329 million was paid in income tax VAT, mineral water tax and dividend withholding tax. 26:25 Webinar ESG is ESG reporting is ongoing and we looking forward to publishing a report [Indiscernible] community and confidence.\\nJaco Prinsloo: 26:47 Thank you very much Lewanne and I think let us have a quick look at the PGM basket process and in the market and also where to from here. I think very briefly, just a recap on the Prill Splits we've had earlier in the presentation as well. But it puts in perspective, when you look at the price trend at the bottom, we have the big increase, especially Erodium. That purple line in the bottom of the graph increased about mid last year, and then the sharp decline they after. But fortunately, we have started seeing uptick again since early this year. And I'll explain that a bit more in terms of the fundamentals on the next slide. But just you know you can see our Odium is 56% of our revenue for the past year. Our impact on the price of rhodium because we are pro is a good splits. So when it was all going well, and rhodium is up it's all positive and when rhodium is declining. It does have a negative side to results. 27:56 So when we look at a market and where we think the price will go I think it's important to understand in the metals that we deal with in the form a significant part of our basket. What drives that I think palladium and rhodium in very much getting together with the auto catalysts sales rates a significant portion 83% and 91% or setback roughly on the demand. And that was heavily impacted during the past year with a slowdown in internal combustion vehicle sales that was impacted by the global chip shortage. But we have seen as the sales are starting to improve and also forecast to improve significantly during the year, we have seen recovery starting in these metals and with analysts forecasting these metals to remain in deficit. For the short to medium term, we're quite positive that we should still experience robust process on palladium rhodium and some yes, we fully aware that battery electric vehicles are a threat to the internal combustion engine that [Indiscernible]. 29:07 But, you have to also look structurally at the capacity of producers to produce the necessary battery metals, your nickel, cobalt, lithium, etc to double the batteries and also as a result of the supply and demand or the increasing process. And we've seen very sharp increases already and those are factors that might slow down the battery electric vehicle rollout, they will list as I said, for the short-to-medium term, we're quite confident in the palladium and rhodium market. The Platinum on the other side of being in surplus at the price was more under pressure in recent years, however, with Platinum’s role in both us and industrial, chemical applications, and also the opportunity where some suppliers are looking at substitution from palladium to platinum in some more tickets. That is the demand for platinum we're looking for going forward is forecast to increase and I think, analysts vary slightly in the forecast. But between 5 and 7 years, we expect the Palladium price – the platinum price to increase more platinum plays quite a big role in the hydrogen economy in the sense of hydrogen catalysts, both in industrial catalysts and also in fuel cell vehicles. 30:31 So we'll keep our eye on that. And I think just when you look at some of the prices, we've heard from a few institutions, I think this first one the platinum and Standard Bank – Standard Bank corporate banks forecasts in terms of platinum, especially the long-term increasing is in line with that expected demand increase and Olbermann netbank have a more stable outlook. And then palladium and rhodium, you can see both have a declining profile, but still significantly higher than historic levels. While gold is quite flat, and but it's a minor portion, there's not 1% in our overall basket. 31:12 So in general, I think we were the process is at the moment, we don't anticipate the process necessarily to go back to where we've seen them in the first half of last calendar year. But we do believe there'll be remained significantly stronger than we've seen in recent years. So if we look at the strategy and our outlook going forward, we obviously remain committed to return significant value to our shareholders. And we do that in the sense of creating positive – generate positive guests and returning value to the shareholders both by means of dividends. And we've done both NL and windfall dividends, and also regular share buybacks. And also by not going back to the market to ask for money to fund our growth projects. We haven't had the need to raise any capital in the market since 2009 and all our growth up to now has been funded from internal cash resources completely. So we want to maintain and continue with an annual stable sustainable annual dividend and a progressive dividend. For shareholders, we continue to generate cash there and then as we've done with this particular windfall, we have higher than anticipated metal prices, compared to consensus values for a period, we would look at sharing, again, additional money with our shareholders. And then obviously, you know, since 2015, we've had almost 50 million – 49 million shares that we bought back of which we cancelled nearly 13 million shares, retained by the shareholder so that's a philosophy that we will continue to do, obviously, in order to maintain flows back to our shareholders. We have to ensure that we continue generating profits and that we have a sustainable business going forward. And we do that in three ways. Firstly, with the normal R&D and press optimization initiatives where we focus on our existing operations, making them more efficient, and doing certain modifications employing new technology so that we can get more out of them and I think there's only two that is the way we've since about 2014, or the same number of operations managed to increase our rounds profile, from about 45,000 ounce to over 70,000 ounces, and in recent years, and do that affect to MF2 projects, Lesedi and Tweefontein projects that are discussed already earlier in the presentation, he is looking to roll out in the in the short-term. Also, the fine chrome opportunity I've spoken about this is something that can follow in the short term approach, and then also feeding dump source into existing operations. 34:03 If you look more longer-term, and in terms of expanding capacity and creating longer life of mine, we've been over the years engaging with a number of third parties in the industry, to look at adding resources to our program and we are confident that both from the eastern and western levels respectively, that we're able to add those resources in the timeframe suggested that could add between 10,000 ounces and 20,000 ounces a year each. If we progress them, and we've currently busy with investigations on them, and if anyone on specific commercial terms will decide on how we roll out and what form it will take in terms of both funding from capital, we do have I've given them because the figure of say between $20 million and $25 million is what we expect on each of these projects, to bring them to commissioning. And, with our current cash generation forecasts that on cash reserves, we should be able to fund our projects and maintain a stable dividend. When we look longer-term, and probably deviating slightly from the current dump and current earnings business is the longer-term inspiration projects, that those are two mineral projects for which we own the mining rights – approved mining rights or they have been granted and that is purchased up in the northern limb. And we've had them for a number of years. Obviously, I explained that the previous periods of our original business model was a lot more bullish, and we were prepared to take a lot more risk by building our own smelters and refineries or the intention to do it in the regional scope or some 12 years ago. But that's highly capital intensive and higher risk. 35:49 So we have in recent years and over the last two years decided we can rather look at focusing on the high-grade area, so these are losses. So we stating the resource statement so that we can produce a higher grade concentrate that saleable to existing smelters and refineries, without us to having incur the cost and risk of own internal either metallurgical in Parliament political infrastructure and that's what we're looking at these projects. Obviously, from a timeline perspective, you would remember, I've announced earlier, when we launched the specialist studies on Prill Split and the northern Prill Split study outcomes we expected expecting during the next 6 months, we should be able to restate the resources and reserve to acceptable limits that we are able to make a decision on how we want to progress with the project. 36:44 The Northern Limb entailed some additional drilling, and those drilling work has been concluded at the end of December. And we're busy with logging analysis and sampling at the moment on all those things. And then we will also hopefully, by year end of geological results to share and then a couple of months later, we will be able to have the money models run on that as well. 37:13 These projects, I think it's important to stress that, looking at the capital requirement to them and also the size is we – as a board will make a decision once we have the feedback on the studies and the results per se. Does that fit into our current strategy of being profitable, low risk and sustainable projects for the current business to do in in-house resources or do we say this in you need to partner maybe you're one of the bigger players in the market to progress them or potentially sell them or throw them out in a different vehicle. So those decisions have not been made yet and it's premature to decide that now before we have all the final information. But certainly what we do believe is that it is quality resources. It is shallow resources as I said they are open but of all they can be opencast mining so the near surface and the philosophy change we made is that we can produce grants that are sellable to the current market. So this just hopefully give you a flavor of this is significant potential life, there is growth and I'm confident that, with well proven record over the years of growing the business to where we are that we will be able to continue to grow it. 38:35 Finally, just maybe inclusion as the option as I mentioned earlier, production is key for us to ensure that we are able to continue to fund our growth aspirations, also that we are able to fund shareholder returns. We believe the PGM market is robust enough, though, for us to support us in that regard, from strategic point of view is focusing on the things we can control, production, operating cost, and a product rollout and more importantly, in the last couple of years, in recent years, there's been a strong focus on specific strategic alliances and partnerships with third parties and also we have identified external growth opportunities. And we continue to build on those, and then to have sustainable shareholder value and both in the form of dividends and share buybacks. 39:29 And you can see in the capital allocation at the bottom that just our capital committed is specifically for those strategic projects, new tailings storage facilities like this, I'll be in exploration assets, you will see there is no capital and a capital slide, which they uncovered. There's no additional capital for operational projects, currently in our estimates – forward looking estimates and it's purely because we haven't added any additional answers for it in our current estimates. So those things will be determined once we bring those projects finalization. 40:00 And then finally, it always remains a decision in a key consideration for us to be able to fund evidence and share buybacks that we have adequate cash available. So yes, that brings us to the – to the end of the presentation, and I think…\\nOperator: 40:17 Jaco and Lewanne. Thank you very much for your presentation this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, please do continue to submit your questions using the Q&A tab. It's just situates on the right hand corner of your screen. But just while the company take a few moments to review those questions already submitted, I'd like to remind you the recording of this presentation along with a copy of the slides and the published Q&A can be accessed by your investor dashboard. Jaco and Lewanne, we've received a number of pre-submitted questions from investors. And I wanted to start off the Q&A session with these.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 40:45 The first one I believe you touched on in the presentation. But maybe if you could write a bit more color, will the management team be looking at share buybacks moving forward?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 40:56 Yes, thank you, Jake (ph). No, as I said, it is a key consideration for us. And when we look at the current best cash position and capital requirements, we have agreed to make a sizable amount available for share buybacks in the near future, we'll always approach them on opportunity basis, we believe we can add value to shareholders. So that's something we will continue, and the board is committed to doing. And I think also positive in that regard is taking the balance of shares currently in Treasury that have to you need for employee share schemes and remuneration going forward. We don't need to buy any shares back for that, if initially as we would buy back in future would be canceled, and therefore add value.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 41:46 Thank you. The second question that we received pre submitted was, are any of the planned work overs or developments on unexploited assets expected to make any significant improvement to ounces produced? Or are these works just expected to keep us near current output?\\nLewanne Carminati: 42:03 Yeah, look, I think that's important one, and I, without us having to have the exact apart from that project pipeline, the idea is that it's not just sustaining current level, we you have inflationary cross bridges over the time and if you're going to stay at the same production levels or declining production levels, you will erode your margins going forward. So the key is always to say, Listen, how do we grow the business more, and I think we've always had a growth plan. And in this last two years, it was unfortunate significantly hampered firstly, by COVID and then by the host mine cut back, otherwise, we would have seen the growth on our profiles, but we're also looking at a more significant growth going forward and into the projects that we're looking to add on the profile. So I think, when we shared profile earlier, we were looking at between 60,000 ounces and 70,000 ounces for about 7 to 10 years. We're after as most of our primary dump sources are curating your life anymore on current devices and dump it probably would have tapered down to say 40,000 ounces to 50,000 ounces, adding additional plants to the tune of 15 or 10,000 ounces to 20,000 ounces on Eastern Western and respectively, you suddenly move your margin to stay over, say about 100,000 ounces and then even longer-term, you can add the expression of projects if we decide to continue then even on top of that, so certainly the idea is to grow the profile rather than just maintaining the profile and replacing existing production. So, I hope that answered the question.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 43:39 That's great. The final pre submitted question that we have here reads as follows. The Global Automakers the signaling a massive ramp up in production this year, hopefully, basket price will be robust as a result, how can Sylvania take advantage of this could output be increased temporarily to build stocks and position to sell into high into high basket price?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 44:00 Look, so that is, unfortunately, the flexibility is not that great? That way, suddenly, we can change our production plans to suit the market. The Prill Splits and others ratio of the platinum palladium rhodium in our orders are quite consistent and constant. So this unfortunate opportunity for us to do that, what we can do in what we continuously do is to evaluate, we often get approached by third parties to say, they have higher grade material, maybe from operations, whether the treatment facilities and can you treat it. And if we have an operation, for instance, we currently treating a low grade dump material, and you're able to substitute their feed with a higher grade material and then the incremental value we generate makes sense for both parties. Certainly, those are things we continuously evaluate and from our own mining perspectives, we can look at our own resources and CIP, we can optimize rates. But unfortunately, it's not huge flexibility in that regard. But it remains a consideration in how we approach our food sources and their business plans.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:09 That's great. Thank you so much for that, if I may, could I please ask you to open up that Q&A tab, which is on the right hand corner of your screen. As you can see, we received a number of questions throughout today's presentation and thank you once again, to all investors for submitting those questions. If I could please ask you to read out the questions and give response where it's appropriate to do so. And I'll pick up from you at the end. Thank you.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 45:32 Okay, so I'm looking at one of the things, but I think maybe while I was talking, I don't know if it's been answered. So there was a question from David, say, you say you are using excess cash to buy back shares, or the shares being cancelled or held in Treasury and buybacks that to be to be having a positive impact on the share price. And I think I have indicated that, you know, we have sufficient trades and priority to fulfill the needs of our share schemes. So obviously, we would be looking at cancelling them and I know there's been a big debate of does the cancelling add value or not, we certainly have a number of our institutions shell as I said, they prefer the buyback over the dividends, this other search engines prefer the dividend. And we always try to maintain a balance. And that's also I would say, it's also just to have opportunistic approach to it and see, when in the spells, we'll be dealing with a lower share price that we do the buyback thing. And sometimes shareholders perceive it as not having any impact, but you put it well, at the share price declining further divide, that's not happened. So again that answer to the question from David.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 46:46 That was, David, if on the screen I see this a next question from David [Indiscernible] I'm not sure if the same David or another one. And he asked, and you can probably along the similar lines, can you comment on the poor valuation of the share price and why this is what I believe is a he said earnings of only for?\\nLewanne Carminati: 47:05 And I think these leaning shoulders that raised their frustration about the valuation of the share price in recent years. And I mean, that's something we also try to work on, unfortunately, conflict roller, the share price, it's based on, on how the market perceive the value. But what I do think is, once you're able to have more tangible resources, I mean, we believe that the growth is there. But for analysts and investors to make proper long-term forecast, it always helps to have proper reserves and resources available. So there's a timeline is a clear indication of how much you have and for how long it will last, and I'm – I'm hoping that even next in this next year, we will be able to bring a lot more of that to the table whereas we update our resources on our exploration projects, we can do it the third part is re-engaging with approved the resource and reserve statements of that work and I think that will help shield us to ever a clear line of sight in terms of what our business is based on. It's always been difficult with our current arrangement of those mines, where you operate, to show you a commercial, confidential commercial agreement. And it's a private list of companies so they don't disclose any of their operations. And I believe that might be a big impact on why we're not seeing the valuation as strong as it could be, and understandably so. But I do think the situation that should improve going forward.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 48:42 I think this, the next question I see is from Michael D. He says, are you continuing to experience cost pressures in the business?\\nLewanne Carminati: 48:50 Look, obviously, I mentioned first one for us is the fact that we have a large, fixed cost portion. So obviously, when the answers are down, we are under pressure, there's our unit costs to hire from the external points. Yes, we've had recently a 15% increase in electricity. We have, our global national utility have asked or applied for a 20% increase rate for the next financial year and that's currently still have to be approved by the authorities. I think, a lot of the local analysts believe that they probably wouldn't be approved. But in any case, the electricity has been higher than standard inflation, the last few years. So electricity always remain a cost pressure. We fortunate enough that from a labor perspective, our labor portion is lower than typical conventional underground mines and we've been since we started the company, I've been able to always conclude wage negotiations on a reasonable industry related values. And so labor have also been in fine. I think on the projects, we see a bet on post [Indiscernible] supply of steel in electronics, and those kind of things a bit more of increase in prices. But from those normal running operations, the highest cost project is probably electricity demand. Thank God, if I look at my drop down screen, that's probably the…\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 50:35 Yes, I was just gonna say thank you for addressing all those questions that you can from investors today. And, of course, ladies and gentlemen, the company will have the opportunity to provide answers to any further questions where they believe it is appropriate to do so. And they'll be available on the investment company platform. Jaco perhaps before redirecting investors to provide their feedback, which is particularly important to the company. Can I please ask you for a few closing comments to wrap up with, thank you?\\nJaco Prinsloo: 50:58 Yeah, thank you, Jake. I think there's a sector as always, it's – it's a great opportunity for us to engage with investors and I said it before this platform, since COVID have provided us the opportunity to reach many more than we could do with an additional roadshow going for Lewanne. So thank you very much, then I think, looking over the results for the passport, although it's a robust set of results. These definitely room for improvement. And I hope that we have given the shell this assurance that we know exactly where the areas are and that we are putting adequate and sufficient plans in place to address them. And also, I hope that the chairman's can see that these are the of quite a solid, sustainable and attractive growth profile of us. And I'm sure we will be able to return value to our shareholders in significant value for many years to come. So thanks for the confidence. Thanks for the support. And thanks for the opportunity.\\nUnidentified Company Representative: 52:05 Jaco and Lewanne, thank you very much for updating investors this afternoon. Could I please ask investors not to close this session as you'll now be automatically redirected for the opportunity to provide your feedback and all that the management team can better understand your views and expectations? It's going to take a few months to complete, I'm sure will be greatly valued by the company. On behalf of the management team of Sylvania Platinum Limited.

My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating your call today.  0:26 I will now hand you over to host, Matt Funke to begin. Matt, please go ahead.\\nMatthew Funke: 00:32 Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Funke, CFO with Southern Missouri. Thank you for joining us. The purpose of our call this morning is to review the information and data presented in our quarterly earnings release dated Monday, October twenty five, twenty twenty one and to take your questions. 00:48 We may make certain forward-looking statements during today's call, and we refer you to our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements contained in the press release. I'm joined on the call today by Greg Steffens, our President and CEO, and Greg will lead off our conversation with commentary on our current operations, our lending activity and our credit quality measures.\\nGreg Steffens: 01:10 Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. Again, I'm Greg Steffens and I want to thank you for joining us this morning. Since our last call, public health authorities in our region did report a peak in COVID cases from mid to late August and now been reporting substantial declines over the last eight weeks. We continue to see few restrictions on business activity in our primary markets and our operations have been much less impacted since our prior call. 01:42 We again remain positive about our credit profile and borrower performance. We continue to see limited number of relationships operating under modified terms under the CARES Act. We have four loans continuing under interest only modifications and are to borrowers in the hotel industry and totaled just under twenty four million dollars. We continue to analyze this portfolio closely and we have continued to see improvement by most of these customers. 02:13 PPP forgiveness continued in the September quarter. The release notes that we received almost thirty seven million dollars in PPP forgiveness during the September quarter, down slightly from the prior two months -- two quarters and twenty six million dollars in PPP loans remain outstanding. Accelerated fee recognition picked up some in the September quarter as the average fee was higher on second round loans that made up a larger percentage of those loans forgiven. As of September thirty, eighty seven percent of our PPP loans originated in both rounds one and two had been forgiven. 02:56 Our non-performing loans were slightly higher this quarter, up about three hundred thousand, but offsetting that was our adversely classified loans were slightly lower down from the prior quarter by one million dollars to seventeen point one million dollars, a year ago, they were twenty five million dollars. Past due loans were higher, but only modestly, so they totaled four point eight million dollars, which represented twenty one basis points on a loan portfolio, which is up from seventeen basis points in the prior quarter, a year ago, they totaled six point nine million dollars or thirty two basis points. 03:37 Any loans still requiring relief under the CARES Act are included as special mention credits and along with watch credits. These combined categories were at thirty nine point three million dollars at September thirty down from forty eight point four million dollars at June thirty and fifty point nine million dollars a year ago. 03:59 For agricultural update, ag production and other loans to farmers were up almost twenty two million dollars in the quarter and up five million dollars compared to this same period of last year. While ag real estate balances were up about five million dollars over the quarter and three million dollars compared to the September thirty of last year. Our agricultural borrowers are in the middle of harvest season and lenders node average to higher yields in their fall progress performance. 04:30 Our corn harvest is mostly complete and yielding one hundred and seventy five to two hundred bushel an acre for non-irrigated ground, and in the two fifty bushels an acre per irrigated ground. Pricing has being at five point five dollars to six dollars a bushel. Rice is mostly complete and yielding in the one hundred and eighty bushel am acre for conventional rice varieties and two twenty for our hybrid varieties. Pricing at this time is from six to six twenty five a bushel. 05:03 The soybean harvest is about halfway complete, yielding forty five to sixty bushel an acre for non-irrigated ground and as high as eighty dollars or eighty bushels an acre for irrigated ground. Pricings range from twelve dollars to thirteen dollars a bushel and some farmers are actually running into issues with elevators not accepting soybeans until they ship out corn and rice by rail or barge. Some farmers have on farm storage, but others may be slower to complete the harvest that they can't deliver directly to the elevators. 05:40 The cotton harvest is just beginning that we expect results in line with the last several years at twelve hundred pounds an acre on the less productive ground and fourteen hundred pounds an acre on the more productive ground. And pricing is zero point seven eight dollars to zero point eight two dollars a pound. Pricing remained well above where we completed our underwriting from corn, soybeans and cotton specifically and modestly above underwriting from rice. 06:07 The most significant downside risk for our borrowers that we see at this time is twenty twenty two production costs and higher input costs or supply chain issues may cause some farmers to alter their crop production scheduled from corn to soybeans over the next year. But we're all even with reduced government payments this year, we expect our farmers to have a more profitable twenty twenty one and twenty twenty where they performed well. 06:41 Matt, would you like to give us an update on our financial results?\\nMatthew Funke: 06:45 Okay, Great. We earned a one point four three dollars diluted in the September quarter. September is the first quarter of our fiscal year. And that resulted down zero point one zero dollars from the linked June quarter, but up zero point three four dollars from the one point nine dollars that we earned in the September twenty twenty quarter. A year ago, we had a charge to earnings for our provision for credit losses as compared to a modest recovery with a negative provision in the current period, although, it's down from a larger negative provision in the linked June quarter. 07:17 Our net interest margin in the September quarter was four point zero one percent which is about, which included about six basis points of contribution from fair value discount accretion on acquired loan books or three hundred and seventy six thousand dollars in dollar terms. Also as forgiveness of PPP loans continued, we accelerated the origination fee accretion on those loans adding another two point two million dollars to interest income which contributed thirty four basis points to the margins. 07:51 In the year ago period, our margin was three point seven three percent of which six basis points resulted from fair value discount creation and has three hundred and thirty nine thousand and PPP loans weren't yet in the forgiveness process at that time. So, on what we see as a core basis, our margin was down almost seven basis points comparing September twenty one to September of twenty. We see our core loan yield as declining twenty eight basis points, while our core cost of deposits was down forty seven and our core total cost of funds down a similar forty eight basis points, but higher average cash balances drove the decline in the margin reducing our total interest earning asset yield, which dropped by thirty nine basis points outside of discount accretion or accelerated recognition of PPP origination fees. 08:44 In the linked June quarter, we reported a margin of three seventy four that included a bit more discount accretion than the current quarter, adding seven basis points to margin, but we also saw less contribution than this quarter from accelerated recognition of PPP fees and it had contributed twenty basis points in that quarter. So on what we would consider of course sequential basis, we see an increase of about fourteen basis points and we would note that about a third of that improvement is due to the current ninety two day quarter as compared to the ninety one day quarter in June. 09:20 Non-interest interest income was down four hundred twenty six thousand dollars compared to the year ago period. We saw continuing declines in gains on sale of residential loans originated for that purpose and their related servicing income. Increases in deposit service charges and bank card interchange income offset some of that decline. A net gain on fixed assets of one hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars was recorded on the sale of bank properties and compared to the linked quarter deposit service charges were higher while interchange income was lower, and servicing income was lower on the inclusion in June’s results of a positive fair value adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights. 10:00 Non-interest income was up one million dollars compared to the year ago quarter, increases were mostly attributable to compensation, occupancy, data a processing and advertising. Compared to the linked quarter, non-interest expense was little changed as higher compensation and occupancy was offset by lower legal and professional charges and advertising expenses. We reported no net charge offs in the September quarter, down even from the very low net charge off figure in the June quarter. Our trailing twelve month figure moved lower to two basis points, which is just under zero point five million dollars in dollar terms of net charge offs over the last year. 10:42 Loan growth was a bit slower in the current quarter, but remained at solid annualized pace for a second consecutive quarter and even though we realized loan growth are continued positive credit metrics along with the stabilized projection for economic recovery indicated that a negative provision for credit losses was appropriate for the quarter, although, as we noted it was quite a bit lower at three hundred and five thousand in recovery down from two point six million dollars in the June quarter. 11:09 On the balance sheet, gross loan balances were up forty nine million dollars in the September quarter, getting nuts off to a good start for the new fiscal year, even while PPP balances dropped almost thirty seven million dollars. Compared to September thirty of twenty, gross loan balances were up ninety six million dollars or four point four percent. PPP balances were down one hundred and seven million dollars over the same twelve months, so if you adjusted for that, our annualized rate of growth or annual rate of growth for the year would be close to ten percent outside of PPP. 11:43 Investment portfolio grows slowed this quarter, but did remain positive. The negative provision along with our loan growth moved our allowances of percentage of gross loans down six basis points from the linked quarter to one point four three percent at September thirty, as a percentage of gross loans outside of PPP, it was down nine basis points over the linked quarter to one point four four percent, 12:09 Deposits rebounded in the September quarter with forty one million dollars in growth reversing the June quarters decline. Our brokerage funding was unchanged while public unit deposits were down more than nine million dollars. Non-maturity balances were up forty nine million dollars in the quarter after a modest decline in the June quarter, but following on strong growth in the December and March quarters. Outside of broker, there were at two ninety seven million dollars over the last twelve months, which is almost a twenty percent rate of growth. 12:39 Time deposits still moved lower down eight million dollar that this was a notably slower pace than in recent periods. And over the last twelve months, they're down seventy seven million dollars outside of brokered, which is a twelve percent decline. FHLB borrowings declined eleven million dollars from the prior quarter and are down almost thirty nine million dollars from twelve months earlier. 13:02 Our tangible equity ratio increased by about twenty basis points during the quarter, as repurchased activity remained limited, income remains strong and total asset growth was limited. Our risk based ratios are relatively stable as we generally redeployed zero risk weighted assets, cash and SBA guaranteed loans into one hundred percent risk weight loans. 13:27 Greg, final comments.\\nGreg Steffens: 13:29 Thanks, Matt. Overall, we're very pleased with the loan growth totals that you've mentioned, and we feel like we're off to a good start for the new fiscal year. Seasonal lag draws were helpful again this last quarter and we also retained about six million dollars of residential loans that we normally would have sold in the secondary market. 13:49 Single and multi-family residential combined for about forty one million dollars our loan growth. Commercial balances dropped on the PPP forgiveness payments and we also saw construction lines payoff. Our East region saw some of the largest PPP payments received and outside of that factor all three regions contributed strongly to loan growth led by our South region. 14:17 Our outlook for the December quarter remains quite strong as our pipeline for loans to fund in ninety days was one hundred and eighty one million dollars at September thirty. Higher than where we stood at June thirty and about fifty percent higher and at the same time last year. With ag paydowns coming, we'll see some seasonal offset for the next several quarters and we should see PPP payments continue to come in over this timeframe. 14:48 We budgeted for between four percent to five percent growth outside of PPP forgiveness in fiscal twenty twenty two, but we currently believe there's a good chance that we will exceed those figures. Our non-owner CRE concentration was approximately two hundred and seventy two percent of regulatory capital at September thirty, relatively unchanged as compared to June thirty and as compared to two hundred and sixty seven percent one year ago. 15:17 In the current quarter, our loan growth in the relevant categories in total was in line with our consolidated capital growth. Strong growth in multi-family was offset by construction payoffs. Our volume of loan originations was about two hundred and nineteen million dollars in the September quarter, down from higher levels in the June and March quarters when we reported some second round PPP activity. In the same quarter of a year ago, we originated two zero five million dollars that compares. 15:51 We continue to expect some deposit runoff in the near term as depositors utilize some of their additional liquidity that they're sitting on. Traditionally, we do see that September quarter is our weakest for deposit growth in December and March quarters to be much stronger. So seasonal factors may offset some anticipated runoff over the next several quarters. Time deposit balances showed some signs of stabilization after four quarters or more of significant declines. Our excess reserves trended back a bit higher in October, and remain somewhat above where we would normally want to see them. First quarter growth in non-maturity deposits was strongest in the West region but outside our public unit deposits was positive across all three of our regions. 16:46 Finally, we pleased that we recently announced our definitive agreement to partner with Fortune Bank, which is headquartered in Arnold, Missouri, which is in Jefferson County portion of the St. Louis MSA and with the second facility in Oak Hill, which is in the South St Louis County. We are looking forward to serving Fortune customers into the growth opportunities supported to us in that market, as we work with the Fortune team, as well as utilizing their team members to help improve our services offered across our legacy footprint. We do expect this transaction to close in mid-February, subject to all customary regulatory requirements. 17:30 In Cairo Illinois, we did reach an agreement to acquire the branch location of First National Bank, which will provide a modest amount of funding in core deposits. And as we consolidate locations provide a more sustainable footprint in that community. We expect to close on that transaction in mid-January. At this time, we are open to look at other potential partnerships if something attractive, comes along and fits our expansion plans. Matt?\\nMatthew Funke: 18:01 Thank you, Greg. And Lauren, at this time, we're ready to take questions from our participants. So if you would remind folks on how they can queue for questions.\\nOperator: 18:31 Of course.  Our first question comes from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. Andrew, your line is now open.\\nAndrew Liesch: 18:38 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. How are you?\\nGreg Steffens: 18:37 Good morning, Andrew.\\nAndrew Liesch: 18:45 Question on the loan pipeline up nicely year-over-year, what do you think driving that, that typically stronger and you might normally see this time of the year?\\nGreg Steffens: 18:57 We've had a lot of people that decided to redeploy cash where we were receiving a lot of prepayment activity from some of our customers in our West region. They’ve become more active at reacquiring properties, again, a lot of the pipeline has been in multi-family, a lot of low income housing tax credit projects that they're buying that they are converting to market rents.\\nAndrew Liesch: 19:30 Okay. Good to hear the loan demand there. And then obviously, some bounding round on the different non-interest income categories from quarter-to-quarter. How do you see that I mean, if you take out the gain on the sale of the former branches, how do you see that four point four million dollars total playing out? It seems like there's -- maybe service charges might be a little bit higher as it was this quarter, but how do you see interchange in gain on loan sales playing also next two quarters?\\nMatthew Funke: 20:05 I think that secondary market activity, we probably or obviously will pass the peak on that. So don't want to overestimate where we may be able to run on that. I think deposit, service charges, bank charge and bank card interchange income, those are probably sustainable numbers nothing particularly unusual as we get into the new calendar year, we generally see a little bit of the drop off on deposit service charges.\\nAndrew Liesch: 20:39 Got it. Those are my questions I'll step back. Thanks.\\nMatthew Funke: 20:44 Thank you, Andrew.\\nOperator: 20:56  Our next question comes from Kelly Motta from KBW. Kelly, your line is now open.\\nKelly Motta: 21:04 Hi. Thanks for the question. My first one has to do with the capital and buybacks. It looks like buybacks slowed a bit this quarter. Just wondering your approach to deploying the buyback, while the deal is currently pending, I know you have a ton of capital, but just wanted to know kind of thoughts with employing that where valuation is and with the deal is that on the table?\\nMatthew Funke: 21:38 With the pending acquisition, giving stock in that we do have to be conscious of when that proxy with solicitation period begin, as we exit from our  period, our understanding is that we can be active and we're always going to look at the relative value of acquiring that stock and what payback period is on that versus holding onto that capital for some potential future use as well.\\nKelly Motta: 22:07 Great. And then maybe if you could add a few comments on the  branch acquisition, just we'll motivated that if there's potential saves from changing your location there or just anything to kind of help us out? Thanks.\\nGreg Steffens: 22:27 On the  location, There's two banks in  First National and our facility was in need of some significant rehabilitation and they actually approached us about us acquiring their location and they have a bigger location that would more fit a consolidated operation. And then on top of that, they have close to thirty million dollars in deposits, which was very similar in size to what we have and we felt like that there's some efficiencies that can be gained by combining the two operations into one.\\nKelly Motta: 23:12 Great. Thanks for the color, Greg. Maybe just one last one on expenses, they were really well controlled on this quarter. Can you remind me any seasonality you have with the start of the year and kind of have you think about that progression, clearly done a nice job getting some positive operating leverage with expense control, but just wondering kind of how to -- if you could remind me on the seasonality of expenses would be helpful? Thank you.\\nMatthew Funke: 23:44 Sure. We do generally reassess employee compensation beginning in January, that along with resetting the clock on payroll taxes, usually does cause us to pick up a bigger percentage of our annual compensation expense build there. And then like everybody we're dealing with competition for talent right now and so I would expect that compared to normal we would see maybe a little more of a build on that line item than what we have over previous years.\\nKelly Motta: 24:20 Thanks, Matt. Appreciate it.\\nMatthew Funke: 24:23 You're welcome.\\nOperator: 24:37  We now have a follow-up question from Andrew Liesch from Piper Sandler. Andrew, your line is now.\\nAndrew Liesch: 24:45 Thanks guys for taking my follow-up. Just on the core margin, obviously, it’s a nice expansion here. How do you see that that playing out for the next couple of quarters? What are some of the puts and takes driving that in this large expansion possible?\\nMatthew Funke: 25:03 I think that will be driven a lot by cash position. There is some upside there for redeployment. We've done a good job bringing our deposit costs down a little faster than what we've seen on the loan book. We appreciate what we're seeing on the yield curve right now with the longer term moving up that should be beneficial to our loan pricing, two months ago, where the yield curve was, we would have thought there might have been more potential for downward reprising on the loan book than what we would see on the deposit portfolio. So, I think we're more optimistic now than we probably for the twelve to eighteen month period. And what we were a couple of months ago, really, I think our number one go on, it would just be maintained.\\nAndrew Liesch: 25:52 Got it. Cool. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Thank you for the call today. I'll step back.\\nMatthew Funke: 25:59 Thanks, Andrew.\\nOperator: 26:04 Okay. We currently have no further questions. I'll now hand back over to the host for any closing remarks.\\nMatthew Funke: 26:10 Okay. Thank you, Lauren and thank you everyone for joining us. We always appreciate your interest in the company and we'll speak again in three months. Have a good day.\\nOperator: 26:23 This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.\",\n",

And welcome to the Adaptive Biotechnologies First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  00:30 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Karina Calzadilla, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.\\nKarina Calzadilla: 00:40 Thank you, Alexandra, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to welcome you to Adaptive Biotechnologies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release reporting Adaptive financial results for the first quarter of 2022. 00:54 The press release is available at www.adaptivebiotech.com. We are conducting a live webcast of this call and will be referencing to a slide presentation that has been posted to the Investors section in our corporate website. 01:07 During the call, management will make projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. These statements reflect management's current perspective of the business as of today. Actual results may differ materially from today's forward-looking statements, depending on a number of factors, which are set forth in our public filings with the SEC and listed in this presentation. 01:33 Joining the call today are Chad Robins, our CEO and Co-Founder; and Kyle Piskel, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Harlan Robins, Adaptive's Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder; Nitin Sood, our Head of our MRD business, and Sharon Benzeno, Head of the Immune Medicine business will be available for Q&A. 01:52 With that, I will turn the call over to Chad Robins. Chad?\\nChad Robins: 01:55 Thanks, Karina. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. As always, I want to thank all of our Adaptive employees for their dedication and for their solid execution during a quarter in which we completed a reorganization of our business. 02:14 This strategic restructuring focuses Adaptive in two business areas: MRD and immune medicine. Along with our recent headcount reduction these changes will result in a more streamlined organization to fuel growth as we navigate this turbulent market. We continue to hire talent strategically in key growth areas, such as our clonoSEQ sales team and our Cell Therapy Group in South San Francisco. We also look forward to formally welcoming our new CFO, Tycho Peterson and leveraging his extensive expertise. Tycho will officially start on June 1st, following completion of his garden leave. 02:54 Reprioritized the product development efforts for each business area and the teams are in place to execute towards our 2022 goals. Slide three shows the respective key drivers of our MRD and immune medicine businesses. The value of our MRD business is a combination of the clonoSEQ test offer to clinicians and the clonoSEQ MRD assay offer to pharma partners, who integrate MRD status and they are hem malignancy trials. Aligning these synergistic components of the MRD business under the same leadership at Adaptive will drive execution and enhanced visibility. 03:35 The immune medicine business is comprised of pharma, clinical testing and drug discovery, all of which are driven or informed by our T-cell receptor antigen map. As with our MRD business within immune medicine there is a synergistic value between the utility of the information for clinical diagnostics and to pharma partners in research and drug development. 04:00 As shown on Slide four, our first quarter results reflect a solid start to the year with revenue of $38.6 million. Both business areas delivered key achievements and are set up for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Within the MRD business clonoSEQ test volume experienced strong growth of 45% versus prior year. The clonoSEQ sales team of 70 reps is now fully hired and train and is being deployed to hit the field, progress continued with payers, data generation and guideline expansion. 04:37 For our MRD pharma, we continue to grow our partnerships. This quarter we entered into an expanded MRD pan-portfolio partnership with a major pharma partner in multiple myeloma and CLL for the use of MRD as a clinical endpoint.  in medicine business is also delivered on multiple fronts generating a total of approximately $21 million this quarter. 05:02 Revenue from pharma partners that use immunoSEQ and data generated from our TCR antigen map grew 100% versus prior year. We are well positioned for continued growth as we expand the use of immunoSEQ in multiple therapeutic areas and secure additional key map deals beyond COVID. For example, this quarter, we entered into a new collaboration with J&J to map T-cell responses to RSV for its vaccine program. The clinical diagnostic pipeline with the key detect is advancing in both infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. And in drug discovery, we continue to make good progress with our shared and private product programs under our Genentech collaboration. 05:49 Moving onto MRD business on Slide five. Test delivered grew 12% to 7,698 tests versus prior quarter with double-digit growth observed in all three indications. Ordering HCPs and ordering accounts experienced significant growth of 53% and 36% respectively versus prior year and unique patients tested also grew 59%. Growth in the community setting although off a small base was north of 60% during the quarter, demonstrating a strong start by our expanded sales force focused on increasing our reach beyond academic centers. 06:30 In addition, about 30% of all MRD test were delivered in blood with multi-myeloma experiences the highest uptake versus prior periods. As part of our strategy to cement their leadership in lymphoid malignancies, we plan to expand into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using ctDNA, which is the best measure of relapse risk. We have submitted our application for DLBCL coverage to MolDX this quarter. We continue to enhance the overall customer experience by investing in the integration of clonoSEQ into customer ordering systems. This integration can positively impact both order volume and order pull through. We're off to a great start and on track to accelerate our growth trajectory for the remainder of the year. 07:19 I want to share on Slide six new data about using clonoSEQ and pediatric ALL patients. In this published study 143 pediatric ALL patients receiving CAR-T were tested for MRD at multiple time points using flow and clonoSEQ. Data show that clonoSEQ detected disease in blood that flow missed in marrow. Furthermore in bone marrow, the performance of clonoSEQ was very strong. clonoSEQ detected MRD in 100% of patients prior to relapse with a median lead time of 168 days versus 52 days using flow, giving the clinician significant lead time to inform treatment decisions. I look forward to sharing additional data readouts this year, further demonstrating the increasing utility of clonoSEQ MRD testing. 08:15 As mentioned before our MRD pharma partnerships are key component of our MRD business. Slide seven shows our pharma portfolio, which is comprised of partnerships with over to 60 companies that integrate clonoSEQ in their clinical trials. As efficacy of blood cancer drugs continue to improve, pharma companies are looking for more sensitive ways to measure response. Of note, our clonoSEQ MRD assay was used as a clinical endpoint in support of regulatory approval of five drugs to-date. Almost every major pharma company developing a blood cancer drug is using clonoSEQ in their trials as a clinical endpoint. 08:55 From these partnerships, we have a portfolio of more than $330 million in future eligible milestones based on additional drug approval from ongoing and future studies. We continue to grow and expand our pharma partnerships and look forward to seeing clonoSEQ data derived from these pharma trials to further drive clinical utility of the clonoSEQ test to clinicians. 09:19 Now turning to our immune medicine business on Slide eight. Immune medicine business is comprised of three growth areas: pharma; clinical testing; and drug discovery. Each of these areas has multiple shots on goal to create value in the short, medium and long-term. This value is predominantly driven by data that we generate through our TCR Antigen Map. The pharma research area, which includes over 100 companies using our immunoSEQ or T-MAP products is expected to continue to grow significantly in the short and medium term. The clinical diagnostic area or T-Detect is in the early innings with its first indication launched last year, which also served to establish T-Detect as a new class of molecular T-Cell Diagnostics. We expect T-Detect to be a more meaningful contributor to revenue in the medium to long-term, as we generate and validate T-Cell signatures in multiple autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. 10:28 And the drug discovery area, which is currently focused on our cell therapy collaboration with Genentech is in early stage of development and is expected to be a significant growth contributor in the mid to long-term. We aim to secure additional collaborations beyond cancer cell therapy that could further accelerate our growth. 10:48 Let's take a closer look on Slide nine at the immune medicine business performance this quarter. Pharma was the biggest contributor of revenue growth in the quarter and represented 30% of the immune medicine business. Our immunoSEQ T-MAP product is gaining traction with additional COVID studies and a new RSV program, which I mentioned. We expect to expand the use of existing and future T-MAPs in more disease areas as we continue to generate data from our TCR Antigen Map. As for T-Detect COVID, this quarter orders decreased versus last quarter as we are seeing the virus moved from a pandemic to an endemic state. We continue to offer the test to consumers with modest promotional activities to maintain brand awareness. 11:35 We are focusing on making T-Detect Lyme available via our CLIA lab during this Lyme season, while we accelerate data generation and signal validation and select autoimmune disorders. Drug discovery revenue is attributed to the amortization of the Genentech upfront payment, which varies quarter-over-quarter. For our shared product this year we're on track to deliver up to two additional TCR packages. We also continue to work closely with Genentech to establish the private product specifications and to build our private product data package. 12:12 Zooming into T-Detect on Slide 10. T-Detect in infectious diseases has served as a proof of our T-Detect platform further investments in COVID and Lyme indications will be pursued opportunistically. Specifically in COVID our efforts to establish the T-Cell response as a correlate of protection continue. We have been making progress at a policy level. Couple of weeks ago Adaptive alongside a group of nearly 70 leading academics industry leaders and patient advocates sent a letter to the FDA urging the incorporation of T-Cell response and COVID vaccine studies. This could further drive opportunities for T-Detect and for T-MAP COVID. We also expect to make T-Detect Lyme available in the next quarter. Data from our ImmuneSense Lyme study shows T-Detect sensitivity of 54% nearly double that of standard-of-care serology at 30%, when we hold specificity at 99% for both. 13:15 We anticipate the sensitivity to increase as we identify additional line Lyme specific TCRs from new datasets, that we will use to update our diagnostic classifier. By making T-Detect available in our CLIA lab, we aim to implement the processes, which will be necessary for all future indications. In parallel, the team is working on initiating a clinical validation study in IBD and continues to improve our signal in MS. Our objective is to launch at least one autoimmune indication set by the end of 2023. We're excited about multiple opportunities stemming from our immune medicine business. 13:57 I'll now pass it over to Kyle Piskel for our financial update. Kyle?\\nKyle Piskel: 14:01 Thanks, Chad. Turning to our financial results on Slide 11. Total revenue in the first quarter was $38.6 million, representing a slight increase from $38.4 million in the same period last year. In prior periods, we've disaggregated revenue in the sequencing and development category as you can see on the left side of the slide. This quarter our revenue reporting is now disaggregated to reflect the reorganization of our business around our MRD and immune medicine market opportunities. 14:31 Immune medicine consist of revenue generated from immunoSEQ and immunoSEQ T-MAP to pharma and research customers. Our T-Detect COVID test clinical customers and our collaboration agreements in drug discovery. MRD consist of revenue generated from clonoSEQ to clinical customers and our MRD services to pharma and research partners. We have included a revenue bridge for the last eight quarters in our earnings release and 10-Q to reflect the revised revenue disaggregation. 14:58 Our revenue mix for the first quarter consisted of 54% for immune medicines, 46% from MRD. Immune medicine revenue in the first quarter was $20.8 million, a 4% increase from the same period in 2021. Growth in immune medicine was primarily driven by $3.4 million increase in revenue from our pharma and research partners, partially offset by a $3.3 million reduction in the amortization of our Genentech upfront payment. 15:25 As a reminder, these revenue amortization amounts may vary quarter-over-quarter. MRD revenue was $17.8 million in the first quarter, down 3% from the same period last year. This change was primarily due to recognizing $7 million in regulatory milestones in Q1 of 2021 versus $3 million this quarter. This reduction was partially offset by $3.6 million increase in revenue from clonoSEQ clinical testing. clonoSEQ test funds also increased by 45% versus prior year. 15:59 Shifting now to our operating cost and guidance on Slide 12. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $101.7 million, representing a 28% increase of $79.7 million in the same quarter last year. Cost of revenue was $13.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year, representing a 32% increase. Higher cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in material cost, due to revenue simple volume growth and an increase in labor, overhead  16:35 Research and development expenses for the first quarter of ’22 were $37.8 million, compared to $33.8 million in the first quarter 2021, representing a 12% increase. This increase was mainly attributable to increased personnel costs, including expenses related to our restructuring activities. 16:54 Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $26.1 million, compared to $20.6 million of the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 27%. This growth was largely due to increased personnel costs, primarily due to the expansion of our clonoSEQ sales team and related customer operations teams, as well as increased travel and customer event-related expenses. One-time charges from our restructuring efforts contributed to the growth in expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses, due to reduced corporate marketing efforts. 17:28 General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022, were $24.1 million, compared to $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase of 62%. The increase was primarily driven by expanding our overall facility footprint and higher depreciation expenses. Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $62.8 million, compared to the first quarter of 2021 net loss of $40.6 million. 17:55 With respect to our full-year guidance we’re reiterating our revenue range of $185 million to $195 million, which already contemplated the MRT milestone we recognized this quarter. Both our MRD and immune medicine businesses are off to a great start and we expect them to contribute to our full-year revenue, approximately 50-50 at the midpoint of the range.  it’s early in the year, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full-year commercial and  18:23 Regarding our operating expenses, we are on track for operating expenses to grow at lower rates than revenue as a result of our restructuring activities and as we continue to prudently manage our investments and improve our operating efficiency. We are being thoughtful about our cash and expect to deploy capital off our balance sheet to support those projects with the greatest potential, while also reducing our burn rate. We look forward to providing you further updates next quarter. 18:50 I'll now turn the call back to Chad.\\nChad Robins: 18:52 Thanks, Kyle. As outlined on the call and listed on Slide 13, we execute on key strategic decisions around the restructuring of our business and are on track to achieve important milestones during the rest of the year in both MRD and immune medicine. Our capital position is strong and we continue to manage our investments to fuel growth across the businesses. We're looking forward to a great 2022. 19:20 So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and open it up for questions.\\nOperator: 19:25 Thank you, sir.  And we your first question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is open.\\nBrian Weinstein: 19:42 Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question.\\nChad Robins: 19:46 Sure, Brian. Thank you.\\nBrian Weinstein: 19:47 Hey, I just wanted to go through the growth rate here a little bit, because I know there is some moving parts here, it seems like in the quarter, because you posted basically flattish growth, but Kyle or Chad, can you guys just go through some of the factors that kind of drove that flattish growth, I heard some Genentech stuff that was in there? And in some other things that might have sort of impacted that growth rate on a one-time basis. I just want to make sure that we understand what those things were?\\nKyle Piskel: 20:17 Sure, I'll take that, Brian. I’d, kind of, first like to start with the two main components that drive a bit of quarter-to-quarter comparative challenges. The first thing the MRD milestones and just as a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had approximately $7 million of milestones from our MRD business and this quarter we have $3 million, so we’re seeing $4 million in compression there from a comp perspective. 20:43 The second component is the Genentech amortization and comparing that to last quarter -- last year we had about $16 million versus this quarter where we're about $12 million. So those two things kind of really compress the growth. And if you back those out you’d see about 47% year-over-year growth. So that's kind of driving some of that uptick.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:05 And when we think about the Genentech amortization, it’s always somewhat of a black box for us I think how we should we be thinking about that going forward, I mean just so that we're level set here so that we can turn it back that stuff out in -- with a little bit more visibility. It's always our somewhat confusing for us?\\nKyle Piskel: 21:25 Yes, I'd say for the -- it's tied to our expense investment in the Genentech collaboration, I'd say for the remainder of the full-year, we're still on track to be about the same total revenues last year, maybe a little bit of a bell curve this year for Q2 and Q3 and that come back down a little bit to Q4. But overall, I'd say it will be fairly consistent to last year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 21:49 Got it and then Chad for you, obviously the markets are very focused on pushes towards profitability, cash flow breakeven. I don't think you guys will give you kind of formal talks about that, but I'd love to kind of have some sort of past that you guys are thinking about towards profitability, the steps that you guys think that you'll need to take and any thoughts on timing there?\\nChad Robins: 22:15 Yes, so first I'll just acknowledge that the path to profitability and at least cash flow neutrality is incredibly important for us for Adaptive and we -- I think we got out ahead of it earlier -- early this year and took proactive steps with doing the restructuring and the reduction in force. We continue to look at ways to manage expenses and at the same time, look, we're looking at opportunities to bring in what I'll call non-dilutive cash flow through different partnership and financing mechanisms, look, let's face it, the cost of capital is high right now and we are -- on a past to do what we can. So we don't have to take in capital that will be dilutive to the company in this economic environment. 23:03 That's a two, where Tycho coming on board, we were really sharpening that long-range plan and should have better visibility into that time horizon to get you, kind of, cash flow profitability and should be providing that for you within the back half of the year.\\nBrian Weinstein: 23:23 Okay, thanks guys.\\nChad Robins: 23:25 Sure. Thanks, Brent.\\nOperator: 23:28 We have your next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\nElizabeth Webster: 23:33 Hey guys, this is Elizabeth on for Salveen, thanks for taking my question. Just on the Genentech, maybe if you could kind of walk us through what might be needed for the private product specification? And what you kind of aim to deliver this year, and just maybe remind us what goes into those data packages? Thank you.\\nChad Robins: 23:57 Sure, I'm going to have Sharon Benzeno, who is Head of our Immune Medicine business, take the call the Sharon.\\nSharon Benzeno: 24:01 Yes, thanks, Elizabeth. So, as we previously stated, and on the heels of our successful proof-of-concept screens using a blood from 60 cancer patients last year that was the first pass defining certain specifications that we're carrying through this year and expanding that in an additional set of 30 or more cancer patients as well. And so the goal there is, importantly running the end-to-end workflow on our end in our dedicated South San Francisco lab end-to-end. And in parallel, in conjunction with the pieces of the puzzle that Genentech is putting together, the process being the product. So that’s what we're aiming this year building off of the success from last year.\\nElizabeth Webster: 24:54 Got it. I thank you, that's helpful.\\nOperator: 25:00 We have your next question is from Mark Massaro with BTIG. Your line is open.\\nMark Massaro: 25:07 Hey guys, thanks for the questions. If I can, I'll ask to all at once, I guess first nice growth from clonoSEQ this quarter. Can you just comment on your visibility of what you're seeing in the field? Are you guys fully open nearly to pre-pandemic levels? And maybe just comment about what kind of access you have reps in the field versus virtual? And then the second question is on Slide 17, you show, you've got Crohn's and MS and Celiac kind of in the lead for your autoimmune diseases, should we think of those as like the lead candidates, I guess what my question really boils down to is to what extent are you committed to advancing and investing in RA, obviously Crohn's and Colitis are linked, so can you just help us think about the priorities of the autoimmune disease portfolio?\\nKyle Piskel: 26:04 Sure. Hi, Mark. I'm going to have Nitin Sood, who is Head of our MRD business, take the first question. And then with regards to prioritization, Harlan will take that, so Nitin.\\nNitin Sood: 26:15 Hey, Mark. Yes, so we're seeing an improvement in in-person meetings it's trending in a positive direction. But I would say today is still about 60% of our visits are virtual, but on our day-to-day basis  basis, we see a positive trend, and I expect us to be sort of 50% very shortly in terms of in- person visits.\\nMark Massaro: 26:48 Okay and then just on the priority of the autoimmune disease portfolio?\\nHarlan Robins: 26:54 Sure, thanks. This is Harlan, so we're focusing our resources where our signals are most advanced and we have the highest quality samples for early diagnosis of disease. And of course having a high unmet need, we prioritized MS and Crohn's higher than RA simply, because we have -- we're a little bit farther behind in collecting RA samples, not for any other particular reason. And the key -- the real key that we're focusing on is our -- as our differentiator is specificity here. So just as reference we're aiming to really reduce the number of false positives. So that we can hit an earlier diagnostic market and so that's really been the focus, and that's where we've had the biggest increase in our signals as we go. And we're going to take the learnings from this and apply it into other diseases as we create panels. And in particular for IBD as we’re going to initiate sample collection for clinical validation study into the coming months.\\nMark Massaro: 28:13 Great, thank you.\\nOperator: 28:16 We have your next question from the Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Excuse me, Derik your line is open, you may ask your question.\\nChad Robins: 28:44 Let's go onto the next question.\\nOperator: 28:47 We have your next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 28:53 Hello, this is  from --  on the call for Tejas. Thank you for taking our questions. Would you elaborate on the plans to reduce the work for us, or the reduction mostly and administrative overhead R&D or commercial, what projects do you deprioritize and should we anticipate any delays in key timelines as it relates to clonoSEQ inflection, expansion into DLBCL, any color around that would be great.\\nChad Robins: 29:27 Yes, sure. Hey  I'll take that. So first, we -- there was many areas affected across the business, but it wasn't uniformly distributed, for example, there were very, very few cuts in the MRD business. So to your questions about kind of DLBCL, or any of that kind of project development pipeline is, is all on track. In addition, the -- that's kind of the cell therapy group in San Francisco had very little cut, so there were cuts across going to general and administration, project management and frankly some it's duplicate of our stack hiring as well that we had an opportunity, frankly where we thought we could gain some efficiencies and leverage in the existing business. So we are moving forward and as Harlan said we're being very, very, very clinical if you will to -- these upon here on how we're prioritizing the T-Detect program and we're also being very opportunistic about continued investments for example in COVID given that's taking more of an endemic state and we've seen some of the T-Detect orders, kind of, wane as COVID kind of becomes more normalized in the population. So hopefully that's helpful color to you in terms of kind of how we looked at the reduction in force and prioritization.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 31:05 Got it. No, that's super helpful. And then on the product development expansion efforts into NHL, could you walk us through the rationale for using cell-free DNA. Is there a specific advantage using cell-free DNA in NHL versus some of the other indications? And could this be a strategy that you would like to deploy on a go-forward basis?\\nNitin Sood: 31:28 Yes, so I'll ask answer that question, this is Nitin. Specifically for DLBCL there have been studies that have been published that demonstrate that cell-free DNA is a better handle light, but for other diseases, namely CLL, ALL and multiple myeloma, our cellular assay, does really well. So on an ongoing basis, I don't expect any changes on those three indications. But for not much as lymphoma and more specifically for DLBCL, we're going with the analytes know has the best performance. 32:10 And longer-term on -- we will also look at potentially combining both the analytes namely the cell-free DNA analyte and the cellular assay. Obviously, we're the one company that can do both. So, we potentially look at combining both at the analytes.\\nUnidentified Analyst: 32:30 Great, thank you so much for that color.\\nOperator: 32:34 We have your next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nDerik de Bruin: 32:40 Hi, sorry about that my phone dropped earlier. Hey, can you give us some color on the ASPs for clonoSEQ. I mean, you didn't break out the clinical sequencing revenues, I'd like historically. So can you give us some idea on coverage on just the ASP and just give us, bit more clarity?\\nNitin Sood: 33:00 Yes. So I think this is Nitin again, we've seen steady ASP growth for clonoSEQ or the past couple of years and we're anticipating that the growth will continue in the mid single-digit range over the next two to three years. We're very close to about $1,000 in ASP today and our expectation is in two to three years, we're in the $1,200 to $1,300 range for ASP.\\nDerik de Bruin: 33:26 Got it. And I know this was asked earlier, but just want to go back and revisit it. I mean, do you expect, I mean, the cash burn was quite a bit higher in the first quarter, do you expect that to ramp down throughout the rest of the year? Basically, as the question on, do you have enough cash this year?\\nKyle Piskel: 33:42 Yes, this is Kyle. Yes, so a couple of things in Q1, obviously you don't have the full effect of our restructuring efforts in the cash burn, because of the timing of when we initiated that was late March. The second thing as it relates to Q1 is a bit of seasonality, we have our corporate bonus payouts in Q1. So from a cash perspective, I'm generally thinking of the rest of the three quarters was between $50 million and $60 million is cash flow.\\nDerik de Bruin: 34:10 Great, thank you. That's helpful. And I guess any -- and I'm sorry and did you talk about when you expect to see the NHL assay to be commercialized. I know you're in validation and clear validation now?\\nChad Robins: 34:27 Yes, with respect to NHL, we're going to launch that later this year in our CLIA environment, we have submitted our tech assessment to MolDX and are waiting to hear back on reimbursement, but as with many of our diagnostics and assays will launch ahead of reimbursement towards, kind of, the back half of the year. I mean it is currently available in our CLIA environment and with the cellular assay, but we've got as mentioned earlier, we've got product development efforts ongoing to convert that to incorporate ctDNA into the assay, as well for -- to enhance the product.\\nDerik de Bruin: 35:10 Great, thank you.\\nKyle Piskel: 35:11 I’d would just add one more item to that, as you know before ahead of that launch will be doing what we call a Clinical Experience Program with 30 physicians, so that's already underway and we're pretty confident, that by October, November of this year, we'll have a full commercial launch with strict use and ctDNA assay by October of this year.\\nDerik de Bruin: 35:39 Thanks.\\nOperator: 35:42 I'm showing no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.\\nChad Robins: 35:54 Thank you.\",\n",

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions and comments after the presentation. 0:24 It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Kathy Liebmann. Ma'am, the floor is yours.\\nKathy Liebmann: 0:32 Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. With us this morning are Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Lucian, CFO. Melinda will open and close the call, and Bob will speak to segment performance and the financials midway through. We’ll then open the call to questions. Slides will accompany this presentation and you may view them through our webcast link, which will be available for one year, and a telephone replay of the call will be available for one week beginning this afternoon. 1:10 Before we begin the presentation, I’d like to remind you that some statements made in today’s call include forward-looking statements about La-Z-Boy’s future performance and other matters. Although we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially. The most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to review those risk factors, as well as other key information detailed in our SEC filings. 1:44 Also, our earnings release is available under the News and Events tab on the Investor Relations page of our website, and it includes reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures which are also included as an appendix at the end of our conference call slide deck. 2:00 With that, I’d now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Melinda?\\nMelinda Whittington: 2:09 Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon following the close of market, we reported our fiscal ’22 third quarter results, which included delivered consolidated sales of a strong 22% versus last Q3, including record delivered sales and operating profit for our company owned retail segment. Ongoing strong demand versus pre-pandemic levels $32 million, returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total up to $96 million and all time high and closing on 2 important acquisitions to five La-Z-Boy furniture gallery stores in the Alabama market and the Furnico (ph) Manufacturing Company in the UK. 2:59 While delivering strong top line growth, the quarter also had significant challenges. After a very strong November across the majority of our business, supply chain volatility amplified in the balance of the quarter, even beyond our previous expectations. This had a significant near-term impact on the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity ramp plans, affecting both sales and profit performance 3:27 Within our own manufacturing operations, which comprise the majority of our wholesale business, lack of availability of component parts, including electronic chips and actuators, continued to disrupt production plans but at a higher level than we expected. Beyond the obvious direct production delays, these outages drove inefficiencies as manufacturing cells are trained on specific unit styles and need to retrain on other styles until parts are available. This was exacerbated by such a large portion of our manufacturing staff being relatively new, given our significant capacity expansion, including 3 new facilities in Mexico over the past year. 4:11 Further, these parts outages are disproportionately affecting our higher end products, which sell at a greater level in our La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, including our own retail, thereby magnifying the near-term financial impact. 4:29 With the goal of meeting consumer demand and to best serve our customers in this environment, our procurement team continues to invest in inventory for key component parts and diversify our supplier base, including creative solutions. In one particular instance, we have sent a La-Z-Boy team to work in the plant of one of our domestic suppliers to help increase their production of component parts for La-Z-Boy, as they too are experiencing labor challenges. We will continue to make progress here. The global supply chain disruptions remain prevalent and we will likely be managing them for a while. 5:10 Additionally, the 14-week COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam, where the majority of our casegoods product is sourced significantly impacted our wholesale segment resulting from minimal inventory available to ship to consumers and high freight costs during the quarter. Product is flowing again, and we expect casegoods sales and profits to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 when we were more consistently received product to ship to customers. 5:43 Further exacerbating the disruption this quarter, the Omicron variant impacted plant operations and production across all geographies. In January, at times we had as much as 20% of our manufacturing workforce out, due to contraction of the virus or exposure. As the health and safety of our team remains our highest priority. These peaks are orders of magnitude higher than our previous worst peaks last winter. As with much of North America, we're now seeing the number of COVID cases trend downward quickly, but it will take time to recover from the disruption. 6:24 Managing across these challenges, as well as the ongoing tight labor market and increasing input costs, has resulted in production gains being slower than expected, impacting the pace of delivered sales and profitability growth in the near term. Our number one focus across the company is to improve the agility of our supply chain to increase production more quickly and efficiently. We have deployed SWAT teams comprised of some of our most experienced leaders to our newer, most challenged locations to assist in training and increasing output. We have hired additional key leadership with expertise from other industries to bring fresh perspectives to our challenges, working alongside our industry veterans. And as noted, we continue to identify and act on creative solutions to upstream supply challenges, including expanded sourcing diversity, protective inventory builds and even helping suppliers staff extra shifts to supply key component parts 7:33 These challenges while significant, are temporary in nature and each day we get better at managing through them. Ultimately, demand for our product is strong and we are already delivering sales at all-time record levels. But we must do better to weather each disruption, continue to increase our capacity, improve cost efficiencies, work down our backlog, and service our customers and consumers. While working toward the double digit profitability levels, we know we can achieve in the longer-term with our expanded North American footprint. 8:14 Turning back to the top line and demand for our products, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries Network increased 3% in the fiscal ’22 third quarter and we are at 9% compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 quarter for a compound annual growth rate of 4% across the 2 years. Sales to the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network represent about half of our total manufactured La-Z-Boy products and are directionally indicative of the continued strength of demand for our product over time. 8:52 For our company own stores, our retail segment written same-store sales were down 1% versus the prior year third quarter and up across the two years at a compound annual growth rate of 4%. Given the unusual nature of the past 2 years, written same-store sales comparisons in any given period may shift positive or negative slightly compared with prior year period, even as the underlying business remains very strong. In fact, our annual sales per store across the network now average about $5 million versus $4 million pre-pandemic. 9:35 And as part of our Century Vision, in addition to sustained strong same-store sales, we intend to also grow La-Z-Boy with additional new stores and specific to our company on retail business, opportunistic company acquisitions of existing independently owned stores such as the recent Alabama network acquisition. 10:02 And our Joybird business continues on its strong growth trajectory this quarter, writing 27% more business this Q3 than last year's third quarter with an extremely impressive compound annual growth rate of 51% across the last 2 years. 10:22 Now let me turn the call over to Bob to review the results in more detail, Bob.\\nBob Lucian: 10:27 Thank you, Melinda and good morning everyone. As a reminder, we present our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We believe a non-GAAP presentation better reflects the underlying operating trends and performance of the business. Non GAAP results exclude items which are detailed in our press release and in the tables in the appendix section of our conference call slides. 10:51 On a consolidated basis, fiscal ’22 third quarter sales increased 22% to $572 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting continued strong demand and ongoing manufacturing capacity increases as well as the effects of pricing and surcharge actions. Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter sales were 20% higher for a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the last 2 years. 11:21 Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $39 million versus the prior year period. And non-GAAP operating income was $40 million. Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.9% and non-GAAP operating margin was 7.0%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 for the fiscal ’22 third quarter versus $0.62 and the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 in the current year quarter versus $0.74 and last year's third quarter. 11:52 As I moved to the segment discussion, my comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise. Demand for and delivery of product across the enterprise remains strong. Starting with our wholesale segment delivered sales for the quarter grew 21% to $423 million compared with the prior year period, driven by pricing and surcharge actions as well as higher volume. 12:21 Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 6.5% versus 10.2% and last year’s third quarter. This reflects higher raw material and freight costs sourcing related tariff and duty increases in disruption from component parts shortages. We also experienced continued labor challenges and planet inefficiencies related to manufacturing startup activities, which are exacerbated by the latest COVID peaks. Additionally, COVID related shutdowns in Vietnam significantly impacted the product flow and margin performance of our casegoods business. Driving an approximate 130 basis point decline and non-GAAP operating margin of the total 370 basis point declined for the period. These challenges were partially offset by pricing and surcharges. Fixed Costs leverage on higher volume and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales. 13:16 For the quarter, our retail segment delivered sales increased 19% to an all-time record $197 million, delivered same-store sales increase 16% versus the year ago quarter. Retail posted record high non-GAAP operating profit dollars and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 12.2% versus 8.9% in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by fixed costs leverage on the higher delivered sales volume in discipline expense management. Joybird, which is reported in corporate and other posted record sales of $45 million, a 56% increase versus the prior year quarter. On a two-year basis, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal ’20 third quarter deliver sales more than doubled, representing a compound annual growth rate of 43%. This reflects the Momentum Joybird is building in the direct to consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels. 14:23 Joybird’s profit for the quarter was roughly breakeven as we invested significantly in marketing to grow the business while experiencing increased raw material and freight costs which negatively impacted gross margin. Moving forward we expect pricing actions to continue to work their way through our delivered sales, which will improve gross margin back to target levels. And we will continue to invest in marketing to deliver disproportionate brand growth while sustaining profitability. 14:52 Putting all of this together, consolidated non GAAP gross margin for the entire company for fiscal ’22 third quarter decreased 440 basis points versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to the challenges noted in wholesale offset partially by pricing and surcharge actions. 15:10 Consolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of sales for the quarter decreased 190 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed costs leverage on a higher sales volume across our wholesale and retail segments. Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal ’22 third quarter was 24.8% versus 27.7% and last year's third quarter. The third quarter of last year was unfavorably impacted by a non-deductible fair value adjustment of the contingent liability related to the acquisition of our Joybird business. Our effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to state taxes. We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal ’22 year to be to be between 25.5% and 26.5%. 16:02 Turning to cash year-to-date, we generated $45 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the period with $240 million in cash and no debt and held $30 million in investments to enhance returns on cash. Year-to-date, we've invested $83 million in higher inventory levels to help protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production and delivered sales. We have also spent $59 million in capital year-to-date primarily related to improve in store – retail stores. New upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico, plant upgrades at our manufacturing and distribution facilities and technology upgrades. 16:45 Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter, we continue to buy back shares, spending $25 million repurchasing more than 700,000 shares of stock in the open market, leaving 7.9 million shares in our existing authorized share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have returned $76 million to shareholders via share repurchase and $21 million through dividends including $70 million paid in dividends in the third quarter. 17:16 Before turning the call back to Melinda, let me highlight several important items for the remainder of fiscal ’22. As noted, demand trends are strong across the business and remain much higher than pre-COVID levels, and our backlog remains high. To address this strong demand, we will continue to improve our agility and ability to increase production capacity, although our near-term gains will be slower than previously anticipated. Efficient plant expansion will also benefit when global supply chain disruptions begin to stabilize although this timing is unknown, and these challenges will likely continue to disproportionately impact our higher end products, which sell a greater level and our La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery Stores. 18:02 Specifically the casegoods import business, we expect operations to normalize during the first half of fiscal ’23 as we more consistently receive product and ship it to our customers. The fourth quarter will benefit by containing 14 production weeks compared to 12 production weeks in our third quarter. To recall fiscal ’22 will include 53 weeks of results versus 52 weeks last year. 18:29 Taking all of these factors into consideration, we now expect delivered sales per week in Q4 to be flat to slightly up versus the third quarter and consolidated non-GAAP operating margin to strengthen to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%. We maintain our long-term commitment to steady margin progress, as we deliver incremental capacity increases with our rebalanced North America manufacturing footprint and improve our ability to adjust the supply chain disruptions. 19:00 This will enable us to better service the demand for our highest value products, which disproportionately sell through our furniture gallery stores. However, as noted, many variables will affect the next several quarters progress against these goals. 19:15 Finally, as we make investments in the business to strengthen the company for the future, including work related to our Century Vision strategy. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for fiscal ’22. 19:29 And now I will turn the call back to Melinda.\\nMelinda Whittington: 19:33 Thanks, Bob. While near term supply chain headwinds are impacting our ability to efficiently ramp production to the extent we would like near term. Demand for our products is strong. Delivered sales are at all-time highs. We believe the momentum is sustainable. And we are poised to grow from this new base of nearly $2.2 billion of trailing 12 months sales. In the immediate term, we are laser focused on driving efficient supply chain expansion to benefit our end consumers, our customer business partners, and our top and bottom line financial performance. 20:16 And looking further out, our focus remains on long-term profitable growth as we execute our Century Vision, our strategy to leverage our strong consumer brands to drive sales growth ahead of the industry and deliver double digit non-GAAP operating margins and value to all stakeholders. 20:39 We thank you for your time this morning. And I'll turn the call back to Kathy.\\nKathy Liebmann: 20:44 Thank you Melinda. We will begin Q&A period. Now Holly, please review the instructions for getting in the queue to ask a question.\\nOperator: 20:54 Certainly, [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Bobby Griffin. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.\\nBobby Griffin: 21:26 Good morning, buddy. This is Bobby Griffin from Raymond James. Thanks for taking my questions and hope everybody's doing well.\\nMelinda Whittington: 21:33 Good morning, Bobby.\\nBob Lucian: 21:33 Good morning.\\nBobby Griffin: 21:36 I guess, first, I want to just touch on the price increases and maybe help us connect where we are on the pricing that you've passed through and how much has been realized? And I guess how much is still left to be realized as you move forward?\\nBob Lucian: 21:54 Value the vast majority of the pricing is now coming through delivered sales for the La-Z-Boy brand. We've got a little bit more pricing on both the casegoods side and the Joybird side, that will come through Q4 and a little bit into Q1, just giving some of the increases that we've seen in freight, and what we import out of Vietnam.\\nBobby Griffin: 22:16 Okay. So Bob, is the – is the cost pressures that we're seeing in supply chain wise is more in efficiencies and just having to expedite things and challenges that way versus, just pure cost of items, or you're going to have to take based on some of these more recent challenges you caught out, you're gonna have to take more pricing to get whole again, as well.\\nBob Lucian: 22:36 It's more of a, it's more of a former of what you talked about relative to some of the inefficiencies that we have in our operations and the hits that we're taking as it relates to supply chain disruptions, and the extra work and money and effort we have to spend to deal with that.\\nBobby Griffin: 22:50 Okay.\\nMelinda Whittington: 22:51 Now, that said, we're constantly watching input costs, and we'll continue to price as needed as we go forward.\\nBobby Griffin: 23:00 Okay, that makes sense. And then, I guess, secondly for me -- and that's helpful. I appreciate the detail on the last one. Secondly for me, I know we typically want to get the backlog once a year in the 10-K, but times are a little more unique now and given the size of the backlog. I was hoping maybe just to get a little color on directionally where it's at. Written trends have been positive year-to-date, production has increased. But it's tough to kind of say, has the backlog actually materially come down given that business has been pretty good so far, even with increased production?\\nMelinda Whittington: 23:34 Yeah, the backlog is about the same, honestly. And, we exactly, as you said, it's a – it's a equation of strength of demand and our ramping capacity. And, truthfully, we want to see that backlog start to come down, because that's how we better service our customers and our consumers. But right now, we're at about the same place. And again, it's an equation of strong demand continued, and capacity ramping, but not fast enough to shorten our lead times.\\nBobby Griffin: 24:09 Okay, That’s helpful. And then I guess, lastly for me, we have gotten a couple of questions. When you look at the written same-store sales for the owned and licensed stores, sort of the whole La-Z-Boy network. On a two year basis, they did slow sequentially and now, I guess my question is, I understand timing wise, the price increases and stuff last year can mess with the seasonality. So if you put written into, I guess, if you take and look at just dollars of written business, as is that materially changed from 1Q to 2Q to 3Q, is there anything to read more into that slowdown on a two-year percentage basis?\\nMelinda Whittington: 24:44 I think the thing to keep in mind overall is that the business is about 30% bigger than it was pre-pandemic, and it's sustaining. And, as we think about growth across that demand continues high to your point on any given quarter that the base period comparisons get so strange on, this December, January was more affected by Omicron. And Canada, they were shut down a year ago, for the most part, you get a lot of different wiggles at any given period. But overall, the written trends still stay strong, and our businesses is 30% bigger than it was before the pandemic. So our focus is on continuing to grow that, obviously, we want to keep kind of that same-store sales, written business strong. I mentioned in my prepared comments that right now, our average is about $5 million per store on existing stores. And before the pandemic, it was $4 million. But at the same time, we'll look to expand stores and expand the number of stores we own as well. And of course, that's just speaking to our retail business, half of our business is selling through other outlets, other customers and that business remains strong as well.\\nBobby Griffin: 26:07 Okay, that's very helpful. I'll jump back – jump back in the queue and turn it over somebody else. Thank you for taking my questions. And best of luck, you're going forward.\\nMelinda Whittington: 26:15 Thanks, Bobby.\\nBob Lucian : 26:16 Thank you.\\nOperator: 26:18 Your next question is coming from Anthony Lebiedzinski. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 26:27 Oh, yes. Good morning. This is Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti and company and good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So looking at the guidance for operating margin for Q4, what are the biggest factors as far as driving that sequential increase that you expect?\\nBob Lucian: 26:48 The biggest factors are continuing to make progress against increasing our capacity, getting the hire – continuing to hire and train and retain the folks that we need for that capacity, as well as opportunities that we have to improve our mix with better, I should say slightly improving parts outages on some of the higher cost products that we make and sell through our retail outlets. So those are the key factors that we expect, that will help us to drive it sequentially higher margin versus what we just delivered.\\nMelinda Whittington: 27:24 And those are really Anthony, the same – the same factors we've been looking at all along, we're marching towards stronger capacity and more efficient capacity builds. Unfortunately, this quarter, we had more setbacks than we expected on that trajectory. And it's going to recognize and it's going to take time, but it's really all about driving that capacity, servicing the consumer and getting more efficient as we go.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 27:57 Got it. Okay. And then in terms of the component shortages that you spoke about, so since the quarter ended last month, but has there been any notable change? Or is it just kind of more of the same?\\nBob Lucian: 28:09 There has been – there's been incremental sequential improvement, it's not fixed. I mean, we're some of the work that we're doing with some of our suppliers, and some of the extra suppliers that we're bringing online, are starting to have a more positive impact relative to their shortages. But it's not a just flip a switch, turn it on, and always problems go away. So that will just continue to improve as we move through the quarter and into the first half of next year.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 28:40 That's okay, so that's encouraging to hear. And the last question for me, so Joybird again, did very well. Now accounting for 8% of total sales for the quarter, longer-term hub, how should we think about the growth of that business as to how big it could ultimately become and as that happens? How should we think about profitability of that segment? Longer-term?\\nMelinda Whittington: 29:03 Yeah, we have, as we've laid out our Century Vision, we obviously a huge building block of that Century Vision for growth over time, we've said as a total company, we believe we can grow ahead of the industry. One pillar that is the La-Z-Boy brand, and really reinvigorating that brand. A second pillar is really leveraging the opportunity that the room that we believe we have for Joybird to grow as a consumer brand, so we will continue to invest in that brand. And we do believe it will disproportionately grow within our business and our focus is on maintaining a reasonable profitability with that business, but not necessarily expecting it to look like, an integrated profit on our La-Z-Boy brand, because it is in growth mode. So in different modes of its – of its maturity.\\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: 30:00 Understood. Okay. Thank you very much and best of luck going forward.\\nMelinda Whittington: 30:05 Thanks, Anthony.\\nOperator: 30:09 [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Brad Thomas, please announce your affiliation. Then pose your question.\\nBradley Thomas: 30:24 Hi, good morning. Yes, it’s Brad Thomas with Keybanc Capital Markets. Good morning, Melinda, Bob and Kathy.\\nBob Lucian: 30:30 Hi, Brad.\\nMelinda Whittington: 30:31 Good morning.\\nBradley Thomas: 30:34 All right, just a few more for me here along probably similar vein as some of the earlier questions. But maybe just wanted to follow up on the cadence of the written orders and wondering if you could provide any color on, how things trended through the quarter what you're seeing thus far. In February, we've obviously heard broader concerns about Omicron weather, and lapping stimulus payments as having been headwinds for the consumer of late. Just curious if you're seeing any of that in your business.\\nMelinda Whittington: 31:08 Yes. I can't say there's any dramatic trend change through the quarter other than, as I noted, we saw January hit by Omicron temporarily, right? That was fairly fast. If you think about, again, from a comparison standpoint, Canada was essentially shut down last year. Now they're open. So on a comparison basis, Canada looks great. But from a more long-term trend, I don't think we're seeing any dramatic change per se.\\nBradley Thomas: 31:47 That's helpful. And so with what you're seeing today, you feel like your fiscal fourth quarter is tracking up so far on a written basis, is that right?\\nMelinda Whittington: 31:59 Yes. I guess I would – I'm not going to comment on written for fourth quarter right now as there are so many different moving pieces, including in the base. But I would just point out a couple of things as we think – I think written same-store sales is an important metric to kind of look at what are you doing with an existing asset base over time. 32:26 But I would also challenge that it's maybe – it certainly isn't the only metric to look at any of these businesses right now when the base period is so different than what it has been in the past. So today, our stores are averaging $5 million in delivered sales per year compared to 2 years ago pre-COVID, they were $4 million a year, right? So what the – what we are growing off of that base, what we are achieving off of that base of any given store is 30% more than it had been. 33:07 As we go forward, we'll continue to look at how do you drive more off of that same base of stores, for sure, that same written same-store sale number. But what we're also looking at is part of Century Vision, expanding the number of stores. And we've talked in the past around – we believe there's opportunity for, call it, about 50 additional stores just with an existing space where the marketplace would support additional stores. We'll continue to also grow through acquisition like we did at the Alabama stores here in the last couple of months through, as we have in the past on some of the independently owned. And then, of course, through our other businesses as well. 33:54 So written same-store sales is an important metric, and we believe it will continue to be directionally positive over time, but it's not the only metric by which to evaluate the growth of our business as we go forward, or anyone's business, I would say, coming off of this unusual pandemic time.\\nBradley Thomas: 34:15 Got you. That's helpful context. Thank you. And then I guess just as we think some of the product inability or longer-than-usual times that you're quoting and some of the mix dynamics, I guess just as we're thinking about on whatever basis you want to talk about, delivered sales and reported sales or written sales, is there any way that you think that sales of any sort are being impacted right now by what your offering is like? And if so, any ability to quantify it? Again, I'm just trying to put context around it. Some of the stuff.\\nMelinda Whittington: 34:52 Sure, absolutely. So from – a couple of things. Right now, we're quoting 4 to 6 months lead time, and that is not where we would be. That's on our La-Z-Boy business. We're shorter on our Joybird business right now. That's not good service to our customers or our consumers, right? 35:10 And so it all sort of comes down to our whole focus is on getting that supply chain expansion up running and running as efficiently as our plants have run over time. That's got to happen. As we do that, just simply with what's in our backlog, our backlog is still at all-time highs on our La-Z-Boy business. So just with what's in our backlog alone, we will continue to drive increased delivered sales and improve profitability quarter-on-quarter. 35:47 And we've got a runway again, just with the orders that are already on the books to drive delivered sales incrementally improving week after week. This quarter, a little bit slower than what we had hoped, but we will continue to work through that and through as Bob noted, for quarters to come, we expect to see incremental improvement in capacity. And given even just the orders on the books, that turns into delivered sales right away. 36:16 At the same time, as we're looking at how do you keep filling the coffer again, right? We want to drive that backlog down because we want to be delivering better service to our customers and our consumers. But as we drive that backlog down, we want to be filling that coffer with more sales to deliver. And so with that, we will continue to drive, strengthening written sales. And we believe we can do that through the strength of our brands. And with our Century Vision, I'm really reinvigorating the brand equities as well, to ensure we're growing for the long term. 36:52 Now the exact pace of that on any given quarter may shift around a little bit, but we feel confident that our last – our trailing 12 months is about $2.2 billion in sales for total company. Pre-pandemic, we were at $1.7 billion right? So business is up 30% pre-pandemic and we do believe we will grow – we have the building blocks to grow off of that base ongoing and improve margins over time.\\nRobert Lucian: 37:25 One thing I'd add to that, just from a – how do you feel about the business. When a consumer walks in and they're paying more money for product, and we're telling them it's still going to take them 4 to 6 months to get that product and our sales -- our written sales are still strong, that's a good indication that the brand is strong and that some of the concerns that are out there, that you've written about around stimulus checks going away and other doom and gloom on the industry, we're a little bit more bullish from that standpoint, from an industry perspective, because we're able to weather the higher prices and the longer lead times. Not happy about either one of those things, but we're here to make sure that the consumers who come in want furniture, get that furniture.\\nBradley Thomas: 38:15 Absolutely. And no question the industry is facing just untested level of complexities and challenges right now and you're navigating many of those very well. Just on some of the guidance for the fourth quarter, I just want to make sure people are doing the math right here. I think if we looked at 12 weeks versus 14 weeks and on a per week basis being flat to up, that implies that sales may be up in your fiscal fourth quarter, perhaps high 20s to low 30s percent. Just with the consensus sitting here now, I think only 23% growth. I just want to make sure we're doing the math right there. Bob?\\nRobert Lucian: 38:56 The math is correct to take your Q3 divided by 12, multiply it by 14 and it will be that or slightly better than that.\\nBradley Thomas: 39:08 Perfect. And then just a last one for me about coming back to margins that are clearly a focal point here. I guess as you reflect on the third quarter and some of the guidance here for 4Q, how much do you think is kind of clear cut? Oh, this should go away if we just give it time. This is part of the transitory issues we're dealing with in the pandemic, versus issues that may be a little bit more structural. And I guess, how, if at all, is your kind of long-term outlook for operating margins for La-Z-Boy changing?\\nMelinda Whittington: 39:40 Brad, I'll talk about that in a bit, and then Bob can add in. It's a little bit of each of those. So the first thing is we've got 3 brand-new plants that we've opened in Mexico, as well as the labor challenges in the U.S. So we've got a lot of new people making furniture. And we've talked in the past about it takes 6 to 9 months to sort of get them up to average – kind of average throughput and when that many people are new, that probably slows that down a little bit. 40:14 So a healthy chunk of what we saw this quarter is we were really now with -- we just in January, opened that third brand-new plant. We are every day adding more to the sales and the production capacity. What we saw this quarter is those continued and exacerbated disruptions on parts, the different – the Omicron, outages, and so you're always putting different – in the end, it's an artesian process. So you're always putting different people together trying to make furniture. 40:44 So what we saw is we didn't get the efficiency gains that we expected to in this quarter. That doesn't mean they're not there. And so a big piece of our progress on margin and we're just trying to be realistic about you're dealing with training thousands of people, we're trying to be realistic about how quickly we come up on that. But a big chunk of that progress forward is controlling our own destiny, right? It's getting better every day at training folks to be able to be very efficient on furniture production and getting better at weathering the uncontrollables. 41:24 So there's no doubt, again, the chip shortages continue they actuate as you pick your thing, and we're investing in inventory to manage as much of that disruption as possible. But there are some things like, you can't go buy more chips, right? They just don't exist. So some of those things are real, but we have to work on our own agility to manage that. 41:47 So yes, there will continue to be disruptions. Yes, they will cause inefficiencies. But a lot of going forward is within our own control of getting better, getting our folks trained and being able to weather those things so that we continue to make progress. And at the end of this, we'll have a better distributed footprint of where our manufacturing facilities lie across all of North America that sets us up with a better overall structure, cost structure and service structure than we had pre-pandemic, even though I think some of the external headwinds will probably -- inflation and so forth, will exist for the longer-term.\\nBradley Thomas: 42:39 Very helpful. Thank you so much Melinda.\\nMelinda Whittington: 42:42 Thanks, Brad.\\nOperator: 42:48 There appear to be no further questions in queue.

We have our Executive Management team here with us this morning, Dan, Paul, Chris, Valerie and Hank. Our speakers will be referring to prepared slides during the discussion. You can find the slides by going to our Investor Relations page at ir.cadencebank.com, where you'll find them on the link to our webcast or you can view them as the exhibit to the 8-K that we filed yesterday afternoon. These slides are also in the Presentation section of our Investor Relations website. 00:39 I would remind you that the presentation, along with our earnings release contain our customary disclosures around forward-looking statements and any non-GAAP metrics that may be discussed this morning. 00:50 And now I'll turn to Dan Rollins for his opening comments.\\nDan Rollins: 00:55 Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cadence Bank's first quarter 2022 financial results. Paul and I will cover a few highlights this morning, as well as provide an update on our integration efforts. Valerie will discuss the financial results in more detail. Chris and Hank will provide some additional color on our frontline efforts. And after we conclude our prepared comments, our Executive Management team will be happy to answer questions. 01:19 It is an interesting time in our industry, given the economic trends, including the rate environment and inflationary pressures, as well as the political instability overseas. We are frequently asked questions about how these dynamics are impacting our business, as well as our customers. While we are watchful for the possible impacts of these issues, I'm pleased with the strength and stability of our footprint and specifically our customers. We continue to be pleased with our fundamental operating performance, including our growth efforts. 01:50 We reported net income available to common shareholders for the quarter of $112.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $121.6 million or $0.65 per diluted common share. The only material non-operating item this quarter was just over $10 million in merger-related expenses. Importantly, credit quality continues to be a bright spot for us. We reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter we've been able to post net recoveries. 02:24 We also reported a 22% decline in non-performing loans and leases during the quarter from an already relatively low position. From a balance sheet perspective, we reported net organic loan growth of over $300 million or 4.6% annualized and total deposit and customer repo growth of over $750 million or 7.7% annualized. Our loan growth this quarter was primarily within our C&I portfolio, while the deposit growth, which has historically been seasonally high in the first quarter was primarily driven by growth in non-interest DDA balances, which is a positive for us. 02:59 From a capital management perspective, we repurchased just over 5 million shares during the quarter, and our board increased the common dividend to $0.22 per share per quarter, marking the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases. I believe both of these actions demonstrate our Board and management team's confidence in the future of the New Cadence Bank. 03:18 Paul, I'll let you add some comments.\\nPaul Murphy: 03:21 Thanks, Dan, and good morning to everyone. I continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making, the benefits of our merger from our customers, shareholders and teammate standpoint, all feel very positive to me from talking to others around the industry, it feels like our cultural fit is probably ahead of where some of the other deals are. We're working well together and collaboration is very high. We've done extensive planning and testing for our conversion, which is in line with our original time frame, expecting to do our conversion in the early fourth quarter of this year. 03:55 We're seeing pretty positive growth for customers really throughout the footprint. Texas and Florida stood out this quarter from a community bank standpoint, and our corporate and specialty teams reported nice growth throughout the footprint. 04:07 As I spend time with our bankers, we're making a lot of calls. We're out knocking on doors. We've returned to the office. It's a bit of a hybrid model, but we're out looking for, of course, loans, deposits, but assets under management and more insurance business. We're doing a lot of blocking and tackling. And the key notion here is that core growth is a key driver of shareholder value, and we're very determined and focused on delivering that. 04:32 With that, I'll turn it over to Valerie.\\nValerie Toalson: 04:34 Great. Thank you, Paul. Turning to this quarter's results Slide four provides a view of our summary income statement. And just as a reminder, with the October 29th closing of our merger, the first quarter of 2022 is the first reporting period that we've had a full quarter of the combined results of both legacy Cadence and legacy BancorpSouth. I would also remind you that fourth quarter 2021 results were adversely impacted by the day one provision for credit losses and other merger related items. 05:02 For the first quarter, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $112.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted net income of $121.6 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue or PPNR was $160 million or 1.36% of average assets. There are three key themes as you look at our results for the quarter. First, our continued loan growth has allowed us to grow net interest income and see positive movement in our margins. Second, our non-interest revenue businesses are performing very well. And third, credit quality continues to remain strong, supporting the lack of provision for credit losses for the quarter. 05:46 As shown on Slide five, we reported net interest income of $312 million and a net interest margin of 2.92% for the first quarter, up from 2.90% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of accretion, the linked quarter net interest margin increased by 3 basis points. The yield of net loans, excluding accretion was 3.96% for the first quarter, down 10 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to the full quarterly impact of the legacy Cadence variable rate loan portfolio, C&I portfolio. 06:21 Similarly, the full quarter's merger impact drove our securities yields higher and funding costs lower, offsetting the decline in loan yield. Our total cost of deposits declined to 15 basis points in the quarter. As we look forward, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from rate increases with 69% of our loan portfolio floating or variable. 06:43 Slides six and seven provide some additional color on our non-interest revenue and non-interest expense. Included in non-interest revenue, the quarter's insurance commission revenue benefit from seasonality, a high retention rate and new customer wins. Mortgage banking revenue increased largely due to the impact of rising interest rates on our MSR assets. And as we look at our expenses for the quarter, first quarter is generally seasonally high as a result of resets of payroll taxes and 401(k) match, as well as higher commissions led to seasonally higher insurance revenue. 07:17 Even so, the quarter's adjusted efficiency ratio was stable at 63.5%, and we continue to expect full realization of the merger efficiencies during 2023. While not related to the first quarter, we did announce an increase of our minimum wage to $18 per hour effective the beginning of April, as we continue to see wage pressure, particularly in some of our larger markets. 07:41 Before turning it over to Chris, I would like to touch briefly on the changes in tangible book value. Like many others in the industry, our tangible book value was impacted this quarter by the AOCI marks that are available for sale securities portfolio, due to the rising rate environment. To help clarify the impact, we have disclosed tangible book value per share, both including AOCI and excluding it. Excluding AOCI, tangible book value per share of $19.29 actually increased during the quarter despite our active share repurchases. It is also important to remember what drove this quarter's change in AOCI as simply a change in fair valuation driven by interest rate changes, and this fair value adjustment does not impact our regulatory capital ratios in any way. 08:26 I'll turn it over to Chris for a little more on our business activities highlight. Chris?\\nChris Bagley: 08:32 Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone. I would like to expand on the three key highlights for the quarter mentioned by Valerie, loan growth, credit quality, and non-interest revenue growth. As reflected on Slide eight, we reported net organic loan growth for the quarter of just over $300 million or 4.6% annualized, coming primarily in our C&I book. Hank will make some additional comments on the loan growth efforts in a moment. But as Paul mentioned, we saw a nice growth in our Texas and Florida markets within the community bank and across our footprint in the corporate banking and specialty lending units. 09:04 Credit quality continues to be a positive story for us, which is highlighted on Slide 10. As Dan mentioned, we reported net recoveries of $400,000 for the quarter, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported net recoveries. Our total non-performing loans declined $34.5 million or 22% during the quarter, bringing period-end NPLs to net loans and leases to 44 basis points, while non-performing assets also experienced a similar decline. 09:32 Non-interest revenue, which is highlighted on Slide 13, thus insurance having a nice quarter and reporting total commission revenue, up $36 million for the quarter or 17% for the first quarter of last year. Growth came primarily in our property and casualty portfolio as retention rates remain high and as we also picked up some nice customer wins. Mortgage reported origination volume of $804 million for the quarter with just over 70% being purchased. While we are pleased with production volume, rising rates do pressure our gain on sale margin, which is 1.24% for the first quarter. 10:07 Finally, I'd like to highlight our Wealth and Trust teams, which reported revenue for the quarter of $21.7 million. I'd also like to highlight that this revenue number is up from $8.4 million for the same quarter of '21 and reflects the contribution of the legacy CADE trust and wealth services and the Linscomb & Williams results. We're really excited about the synergies the combined companies bring to our non-interest revenue lines and the future benefits from the cross-selling opportunities, additional scale and market diversification created by the merger. 10:36 I will turn the call over to Hank for some comments on the corporate side of the bank. Hank?\\nHank Holmes: 10:43 Thank you, Chris. I was pleased to see that commercial loan growth in the quarter was spread throughout the corporate C&I teams across the footprint. Our bankers have been leveraging the expanded platform and bringing in more wins as the economy stabilized post-COVID. Specialized lending and renewable energy teams have been quite active, other areas are seeing payoff slow, and we have the teams in place to continue growth. 11:06 I am feeling positive about the growth this year as pipelines remain healthy. In particular, our technology, healthcare and C&I groups are seeing attractive opportunities in our combined markets and throughout the footprint. We are adding good CRE projects from our community bank and corporate CRE teams, primarily in multi-family housing. 11:25 Construction loans continue to fund, but we are still seeing lower utilization. Given the volatility in long-term interest rates, we do anticipate utilization in our construction portfolio to increase over the next 12 to 24 months to more normal or historical levels. Our focus on credit continues to be disciplined. We are not competing at higher leverage points with non-banks on EV loans. The markets continue to be competitive, but the pressure on terms and pricing seems to have settled some. Our teams have come together nicely, and I'm encouraged by the enthusiasm and commitment. I'm also an optimist and excited about many great successes to come for our organization. 11:57 Operator, our team is now ready to answer any questions.\\nOperator: 12:02 We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nJon Arfstrom: 12:30 Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\\nDan Rollins: 12:32 Hey, Jon.\\nJon Arfstrom: 12:34 You talked a little bit about overall growth expectations for the company. I saw you put up $300 million in organic growth. And just there's a lot of churn between the two companies, I would guess, but just talk a little bit about your expectations? And is that a reasonable pace? Or do you expect that, that can accelerate a bit?\\nDan Rollins: 12:52 I'll let everybody jump in on that. There's lots of activity going on, on the growth side of the house. There has been some churn. We continue to see payoffs on CRE flow-through. There's just a lot of activity. Pipelines are also big. So Hank and Chris, you guys are driving some of that to add in.\\nHank Holmes: 13:13 Hey Jon, appreciate the question. So as I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of balanced growth. The pipelines continue to be strong, in my opinion. And I think that with some of the areas like in our renewable energy and certainly the energy component of our bank with prices where they are, some opportunities there. And the C&I teams are just getting a lot of looks. And so the activity is high. Chris, do you want to add something to that?\\nChris Bagley: 13:39 Yes. Just with rates trending up, that's probably going to slow down some of the churn, especially on a community bank, refinance side. But -- it also could impact maybe opportunities as folks are looking at higher interest rates on their projects until that factors in. So how is that right down the middle of the fairway for you?\\nDan Rollins: 13:57 We have some pretty significant unfunded construction lines out there.\\nChris Bagley: 14:00 Right, we did.\\nDan Rollins: 14:02 So yes, there's some activity going on, Jon. We're excited about what the team has been able to do in light of all the changes that we keep throwing out.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:10 Okay. So it feels good, maybe a little bit better is a good summary?\\nDan Rollins: 14:13 I think, we feel excited about the opportunities.\\nJon Arfstrom: 14:16 Okay. Plenty of other place I could go, but just as long as we're on this topic, Hank, you talked about the competitive environment being settled some. And I think that's somewhat encouraging others have said it's ultra competitive. But can you give us a little bit more in terms of examples of what you're seeing there?\\nHank Holmes: 14:31 Sure. It's -- we're always -- we're in a competitive business and it's always competitive. So where I see some slowdown is, we obviously, in CRE, we saw rates fall dramatically over the last 24 months. That seems to have settled down. We're not chasing terms and leverage points on EV and other areas that we compete in are modest or where I would say historically, we're not chasing at this point. So I feel pretty good about where we are from the terms and pricing, but it is competitive.\\nChris Bagley: 15:05 A lot that covered there, and bring the two companies together, there's a lot more emphasis or just the market and type of customer base on the CRE side for legacy CADE. That's floating rate, so that's a nice pickup for us, especially in the rate environment we're moving into. We are still seeing in the community bank markets, upward pressure on rates there, everybody hold it. It's still pretty competitive out there, recently as last month, we saw some three handles, but now you're seeing all that move into the four, kind of a four handle side, not as many three handles. So good upward pressure on the right field as well.\\nJon Arfstrom: 15:41 Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.\\nDan Rollins: 15:44 Thanks, Jon.\\nOperator: 15:47 The next question is from Catherine Mealor of KBW. Please go ahead.\\nCatherine Mealor: 15:53 Thanks. Good morning. Just want to say on the loan conversation and talk about loan yields. And maybe it's for Valerie. Just kind of walk us through, you mentioned 69% of your loan book is floating or variable. Can you just walk us through to remind us what percentage now today is floating immediately? And once we get past, let's just say we get 50 bps in May, so then we're kind of three rate hikes through, how much you're kind of coming off the floors? And then the -- kind of the timeline on the remaining variable piece of the portfolio, just to kind of get a sense as to how quickly we should see these loan yields move higher. Thanks.\\nValerie Toalson: 16:32 Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Catherine, for the questions. Great questions. Back -- last quarter, we said that it would take about 40 basis points movement in order to get our loans in average off the floors the $7.5 billion or so that we had on the floors. Well, we've had a whole lot of that movement actually in the market take place already. And so the next movement will definitely get those off their floors. We do have about $7.6 billion of our loan portfolio is actually floating. And so that's less than 30 days and so 28% of that book. 17:09 When you look at the total book, we've got about 50% of our entire portfolio that will reprice over the next year. And so that gives you a little bit better timing on some of that, with most of that actually coming in the next three month period. And so again, that positions us really nicely as we look at some of the increases that we expect coming down the road. 17:34 When you take a look at some of the portfolio, we are starting to see the impact of some of the rate increases on some of the renewals come through as not only renewals, but also loans that are simply just repricing, starting to see that come through, and we'll definitely see that impact more in the second quarter. New loans on average are coming on around the 360 level, but again, about two-thirds of those are variable rate. And so those will continue to move. Does that help, what you were looking for?\\nCatherine Mealor: 18:09 Yes, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then my next question is on the expenses. So I fully appreciate that this quarter is elevated, because it's a 1Q elevation and then we don't have the full impact of the cost savings in. Is there -- can you just kind of help us take a step back big picture maybe what's a good quarterly run rate we should get to kind of by the end of the year once we have the cost savings fully baked in? Or any kind of guidance you could give us on where you think the expense run rate is going just to make sure we're all on the same page. Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 18:42 I remember, we're on a 4Q integration plan. And so I don't know that we'll have a good clean run rate in 4Q. So I would put that out there first. I think we expect 1Q to be fully baked in, as we get into 4Q and we're -- as Paul said, we're on schedule, we're on task, we've actually completed two huge hurdles just in the last 1.5 months, working towards our full integration. But you're right, 1Q expense run is high. There's lots of things that are in there just naturally. And then when you look at the things we were doing through the merger, I feel pretty confident that we're on our run rate to exceed -- meet or exceed the numbers that we put out there. Valerie has been looking at numbers up while I've been talking.\\nValerie Toalson: 19:26 Yes. I think what might help, I know that the first quarter has a lot of noise and of course, the fourth quarter was very noisy given the timing of the merger date. Last quarter, we disclosed our combined third quarter F '21 expenses. And on an adjusted basis, that was $277 million, compared to the first quarter adjusted expenses of $281 million. But as we talked about, this first quarter did have the resets of the 401(k) match and the payroll taxes. 20:00 And so if you normalize that, and then we also had a bonus that we provided to a number of our employees for inflationary purposes in the first quarter. That amounted about $2.8 million. So when you combine all of that together, effectively, third quarter '21 to first quarter '21, expenses actually came down about $7.4 million. And so that will give you a little bit of a sense of some of the initial incremental merger cost saves that we're starting to see kind of in the underlying foundation. 20:35 That being said, it's going to be bumpy until we get through this conversion. We do have -- we talked about we did increase our hourly wage to $18 per hour. We also have our merit increases in the July 1 time period. And so all that will be a little bit bumpy until we do get finished with the conversion. But of course, none of this includes savings from any branch efficiencies -- and then certainly, some of the savings that we know will come after we are running on one operating system.\\nDan Rollins: 21:10 The wage pressure is still big. And so Valerie hit two topics there. You want to make sure we cover again. So we did change our incoming wage minimum to $18 an hour on April 1. That's a pretty big run rate. That's going to be close to $10 million on an annual run to plug that in. And then our normal merit cycle for everyone that wasn't in that group hits on July 1. So we will see some upward pressure on comp, even excluding the savings and the drop-offs that are there, we are seeing, you saw headcount drop in the quarter, and we continue to see some of that. But as Valerie said, it's going to be bumpy as we move down the path.\\nCatherine Mealor: 21:55 Great. That's clear. Appreciate that, and it's very helpful. Thank you.\\nDan Rollins: 22:00 Thanks, Catherine.\\nOperator: 22:02 The next question is from Jennifer Demba of Truist. Please go ahead.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:10 Thanks. Good morning.\\nDan Rollins: 22:11 Hey, Jenni.\\nJennifer Demba: 22:13 Hi. Just curious, the asset quality is very, very strong. But what do you think are the most vulnerable loan buckets as rates go up and most susceptible here to rising loan losses over the next several quarters?\\nDan Rollins: 22:32 Yes, that's a good question. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of net recoveries. We haven't experienced a lot of losses likely. So I guess looking forward is an important piece of that. I don't know that I have one bucket that I would want to call out. Paul, you got anything you want to add to that?\\nPaul Murphy: 22:46 Well, I would just observe that the -- really the merger is a huge de-risking of both balance sheet and diversification of the loan portfolio. And yes, like Dan, I wouldn't point to any one category as higher risk. I think the risk is well managed across the company. And I would say maybe the previous higher-risk energy portfolio has been de-risked significantly with higher rates as we're seeing profitability in the E&P sector is spectacular. And that, of course, benefits the midstream and the oilfield service portfolio. So -- it's a granular, very diverse credit profile and one of the key reasons why we like the combination so much.\\nDan Rollins: 23:35 Yes. From a credit quality perspective, this is the best credit we've been posting for either of us in quite some time.\\nHank Holmes: 23:41 And I would just add to that. And when you look at the balance sheets of the businesses, they're extremely strong, a lot of liquidity there. I think we're well positioned if we do have some bumps in the quarters to come from an economic perspective and with rates increasing, but I think we're well prepared for that. And I think our borrowers are as well.\\nJennifer Demba: 24:00 What do you think a normal range of annual loan losses is for this company over an economic cycle?\\nDan Rollins: 24:09 I don't have a number to stick on to that. I mean that's a good question. Valerie, you want to add?\\nValerie Toalson: 24:16 Yes. I think that's a little bit of a challenging number. But as far as like annualized net charge-offs, legacy Cadence, we would guide toward a 25 basis points normalized over a period of time, net charge-offs. I'd say that's lower from the legacy BancorpSouth history. And so something below those lines?\\nPaul Murphy: 24:42 When you look at the COVID stress test and some of the portfolios that you might have been concerned about hospitality at legacy BancorpSouth, I mean it just came through with great marks. And so I think Valerie is on the right path, 25 basis points might have been sort of what we thought about for CADE, but something less than that. So combined, I don't know, 10 to 15 basis points. But to hit a narrow range.\\nDan Rollins: 25:10 We're clearly watching the clouds that are out there. I mean, I think your question is fair. It appears that there could be some economic headwinds that were there. We're hoping that they blow by and we don't experience some of that. But we have to be prepared for that.\\nJennifer Demba: 25:27 Thanks so much.\\nDan Rollins: 25:28 Thanks, Jenni.\\nOperator: 25:31 The next question is from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Rose: 25:37 Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So it looks like the buybacks were weighted towards the back half of the quarter. But as we move forward, just given the drop in DCE and understand the conversation, Valerie, about the mechanics of the AOCI hit. But would that give any sort of pause to future repurchases? And should the stock remain under pressure? Is there capacity at this point? Do you think to actually increase the size of the repurchase? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 26:14 Yes. So I think a couple of things. Valerie can certainly jump in here. But when you look at the tangible book value, excluding AOCI, we were actually up in the quarter. AOCI to use another word would be transitory and over time neither one of us have had a habit of trading in that portfolio, so that will work its way through over time and the fact that the tangible book value went up excluding that, which is on Page four of the deck, I think, is a positive thing. I think we want to be opportunistic on buyback. I don't think we want to be locked out of the market, but I also think we need to be cognizant of all the moving pieces, which includes AOCI, Valerie?\\nValerie Toalson: 26:51 Yes. No, I think you really hit on all the points. I think certainly, we've always been opportunistic in the past. The first quarter was pretty heavy activity. It may be a little bit more measured going forward. But again, we have a history, and I anticipate that we'll continue to be opportunistic and do what makes the most sense, balancing all the other things that we have going on. Obviously, loan growth continues to be picking up. And so that is obviously another primary use of capital.\\nMichael Rose: 27:23 Understood. Thanks. And then just on the accretion this quarter. Obviously, it was a little bit higher than I think I was looking for at least understand how much you have left. Was there any sort of accelerated paydowns in there? And then, I think you might have given a schedule or expectation last quarter should -- that we should kind of expect on a go-forward basis.\\nValerie Toalson: 27:46 Yes, that's a good question. There was a little bit of accelerated accretion there. That tends to be bumpy. We had -- we're still looking at, oh gosh, probably about $25 million, $30 million of additional accretion as we go through the rest of the year in scheduled. But again, I would anticipate that it's probably going to end up being a little bit more of that simply because of payoffs.\\nMichael Rose: 28:15 Understood. And maybe just finally for me, just two kind of quick housekeeping questions. With the conversion coming in the fourth quarter, I assume a lot of the cost saves will come in and around there. But how much of the cost saves have you realized today? Because I think you targeted 75% for this year. And then just on the one-time cost. Any changes there? I think you had originally estimated $125 million. Any changes there? And how much have you recognized to-date? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 28:43 Yes. I don't know that there's any change in any of those numbers just the quick answer there. I think the one-time cost, those are hard for you to see sometimes, because some of those costs were incurred pre-closing on the seller side. So you don't see all of that flowing through. We had a relatively low number this quarter. I would suspect that we will see some increasing cost as we move into the next couple of quarters, because we have some things we've got to spend money forward through that computer conversion in 4Q. But from a cost save perspective, I think we feel like we're in really good shape to hit or exceed the numbers that we put out there. 29:19 You're right. As you're looking out to the back half of the year, the biggest pieces of it will fall off in the fourth quarter, but there's little pieces that have been coming along all the way through. Early on, I said we had converted our mortgage shop all onto the same origination platform early in the year. We're in the process of converting the mortgage servicing onto the same platform here in the not-too-distant future. I mentioned a minute ago that we passed now two pretty big hurdles. We actually upgraded and moved our main processing box just over the past weekend. It puts us in a position to be able to do what we need to do that way. 29:54 And we've also upgraded our card processing all the transactions that flow through on the debit card, credit card side, 100s of 1,000s of transactions a day are flowing through, and that was all upgraded just in the last month. So we're making great progress towards the conversion in the fourth quarter, and I think we're very confident we'll hit our numbers.\\nValerie Toalson: 30:14 Yes. The only other thing I would really add to that is, we've incurred about $55 million-ish or so pre-tax, when you look at the fourth quarter, first quarter and then actually looking back at the third quarter of '21, some of that, that was a little bit early. And so as Dan put it, there will be some more. We may end up beating that estimated overall cost.\\nDan Rollins: 30:42 Beating as an coming in less.\\nValerie Toalson: 30:43 Coming in less. It's a good clarification. But again, as Dan said it, there's a lot of activity happening in the latter half of this year.\\nMichael Rose: 30:53 Great. So progress continues. Thanks for taking all my questions.\\nDan Rollins: 30:56 Thanks, Michael. Good to hear from you.\\nOperator: 31:00 The next question is from Brad Milsaps of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\nDan Rollins: 31:05 Hi, Brad.\\nBrad Milsaps: 31:07 Hi, good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking my questions. Not to continue to belabor the cost name, but just kind of wanted to put a finer point on it, Valerie. It sounded like you said that from the third quarter to the first quarter, your expenses may have -- would have been down maybe $7 million from cost savings. I think you initially identified maybe $20 million quarterly, you're going to spend another $2 million, $2.5 million a quarter kind of on inflationary items. So kind of back of the envelope, would that give you sort of $10 million to kind of fall out of the quarterly run rate, all else equal as you get past the conversion date. Does that math still make sense?\\nDan Rollins: 31:46 Brad, you run that through my brain again.\\nValerie Toalson: 31:49 Yes. So post conversion, as we look into 2023, we do anticipate achieving all of the cost saves that we laid out in the document. We talked in the announcement, that's $78 million. And then obviously, we have talked about the impact of the $18 per hour is about $10 million per year. And so there's obviously a little bit of puts and takes throughout there. But you can count on us achieving those merger cost saves. We're committed to that.\\nDan Rollins: 32:27 Yes, I think from a big perspective, Brad, when you look at us, I think, we're still very encouraged that the merger gives us the opportunity to not cost out. The wage pressure that we're feeling, that's affecting all of us. That's nothing unique to our company. Everybody is feeling the pressure that's on NSF/OD fees for the industry is impacting all of us not just us. So there are certainly some industry things that are impacting us, but we as a standalone, we think that the ability to bring cost out through our merger is a real positive for us, and we'll meet or exceed probably both sides of those numbers.\\nBrad Milsaps: 33:10 Great. Thank you. And then just as my follow-up, Valerie. Could you talk about maybe plans for the existing remaining liquidity that you have sitting in Fed funds? Do you plan to put that into the bond portfolio with rates higher or just kind of wait and see with what loan growth does. Just kind of curious kind of how to think about the size of the balance sheet and kind of the different categories going forward?\\nValerie Toalson: 33:34 Yes, absolutely. First quarter is -- has a lot of seasonality on our deposits. We do have a number of large municipal customers, who -- with the tax inflows come in, and then you see those come out in the second quarter. And so part of that liquidity will certainly be to offset some of that volatility and some of that seasonality shift that we will see -- or we anticipate seeing in the second quarter. That obviously using those funds for the loan growth is first and foremost. 34:05 And then it's really going to be effectively what's left over and making sure then that we invest it properly. We do have a lot of cash flow coming off that securities portfolio, about $700 million per quarter. And so that helps fund a whole lot of loans, but also may allow for some reinvestment at some higher rates. Over time, we would like to get the securities book as a percent of assets down as a percent, but that's going to take some time given where we are today.\\nDan Rollins: 34:38 The loan guys need to make more loans.\\nValerie Toalson: 34:39 Absolutely.\\nBrad Milsaps: 34:43 Great. Thank you very much.\\nDan Rollins: 34:44 Thanks, Brad.\\nOperator: 34:47 The next question is from Kevin Fitzsimmons of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 34:54 Hey, good morning, everyone.\\nDan Rollins: 34:55 Hey, good morning, Kevin.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 34:58 Hey, Dan, I just wanted to ask about -- it seems like there was a change in treatment on the MSR adjustment, and I definitely recognize that some peers don't break that out and exclude it. And it is on one hand you got hurt by rising rates on the AOCI. So it doesn't seem fair to just arbitrarily decide to exclude that. But you got -- it had been your practice or legacy BancorpSouth practice to exclude it when talking about core performance. So I'm just curious about is this a change going forward and how you're going to view it? And what would the puts and takes in deciding to keep that within core earnings? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 35:43 Yes, that's a great question. And you're spot on. I think when we look back over time, when we started pulling that out at legacy BXS, it was a big part of the number. It's become more and more immaterial in our process as we've grown, we've been looking at what peers are doing and what's out there. And so we did pull that out of our adjusted numbers, and we also adjusted the -- adjusted numbers looking backwards, so the -- what you see in the deck is all uniform across. But you're right, we've left it in, because it's a much less material number today than it was when we started adjusting for it as a much smaller organization when we were $10 billion.\\nValerie Toalson: 36:19 And that will be a consistent treatment as we go forward.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 36:23 Okay, okay. Great. And can you just give us a sense for a lot of -- how to view the ACL and where that settles going forward. On one hand, I think the combined -- I think you guys might have given up before that on a combined basis what your day one CECL might have been. But on the other hand, we have a little more uncertainty today just with inflation in geopolitical things. And just wondering how to view that ACL going forward, what we should expect? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 37:02 Yes, that's a really good question. It doesn't have a very good answer and you're exactly right, there's a lot of moving parts. The future risk that's out there is the dark cloud that you're looking at history, four quarters in a row of net recoveries would tell you that credit is in really fine shape. But what the future is bringing to us is the unknown, and so to be prepared for that. I don't know that we have a number to tell you where I think it would shake out. But we're certainly watching our modeling, we're making sure we're accounting for the potential risks that are out there.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 37:37 I guess, put it another way. I mean, there's -- I would suspect there's still opportunity for credit leverage for that ratio to come down, but maybe less aggressively than it might have been able to -- or we might have thought a quarter ago?\\nDan Rollins: 37:53 I think that's probably fair. I think, again, the unknown is what's happening in the economy with an inverted yield curve and potential military skirmishes around the world, I think that, that's the unknown and what that does to the economy. That puts the cloud over us without those things, I think your statement would be spot on.\\nKevin Fitzsimmons: 38:19 Okay. All right. Thanks very much, Dan.\\nDan Rollins: 38:22 Thanks, Kevin.\\nOperator: 38:25 [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.\\nMatt Olney: 38:34 Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\\nDan Rollins: 38:35 Good morning, Matt.\\nMatt Olney: 38:37 Most of my questions have been addressed, but I wanted to ask about deposit growth. Yes, it looked good in the quarter, but you mentioned there were some seasonal tailwinds that you guys benefited from. Can you quantify this? Just trying to appreciate if we saw any true sticky deposit growth in 1Q and then kind of the outlook for deposit growth from here? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 38:58 Yes. So 1Q has historically been the best deposit growth quarter for both of our companies on a standalone. We've not experienced a second quarter as a combined company together yet. So this will be new for us. But second quarter has also been the weakest quarter historically for both of us. So I think the anticipation would be that with the municipal deposits that we were both carrying coming into the merger that we would see similar to what we had seen in the past as standalone entity. So when you look back, I think both of us had seen flat to down deposits in 2Q for the last several years, and I would think that all things being equal, I don't know why it wouldn't be the same this year.\\nMatt Olney: 39:38 Got it. Okay. That's helpful. On the mortgage front, it looked like the percent of production sold was down this quarter around 50%, it had been at 78% range over the last few years. Is this a timing issue? Or just structure you guys choosing to sell less the production and to balance sheet more of that? Thanks.\\nDan Rollins: 40:04 Yes, nothing has changed from a structure standpoint, there's timing and there's product. So if there's a product mix, we have been retaining the arms on the balance sheet. And so if we're putting more arms or producing more arms, those would stay, but there's been no change in our process. Chris, you want to add in there?\\nChris Bagley: 40:22 Yes, no change. There's probably some noise from the combination of the company. It just hasn't shook out yet as well because both sides are doing mortgages, portfolio mortgages, and we were doing a lot more volume relatively speaking, on the secondary market side. So I think it just takes some time for that to sort of balance itself and see some trends that make sense.\\nDan Rollins: 40:41 And remember, we finished the merger, the consolidation of all of our origination on the one platform in the first quarter. So there's certainly some timing issues and work going on there.\\nMatt Olney: 40:53 Yes. Okay. Thanks guys.\\nDan Rollins: 40:57 Thank you, Matt.\\nOperator: 41:00 This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\\nDan Rollins: 41:08 All right. Thank you all. In closing, I believe our results speak for themselves in terms of the early successes of the combination of our two companies. The fact that we've continued to report meaningful balance sheet growth so soon after the legal merger closing is a tremendous testament for the efforts of our collective group of bankers as well as the cohesiveness of our back office and the credit support functions. 41:29 Aside from industry-wide headwinds on mortgage, our fee income businesses continue to grow at impressive rates. As we look forward, we're challenged -- we've challenged our frontline teammates to build on this momentum, while our back office and supports personnel continue their efforts working towards the successful completion of our integration efforts later this fall. It truly is an exciting time for the New Cadence Bank. Thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all again soon.\\nOperator: 41:58 The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

Welcome to Axalta’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation by management. Today's call is being recorded and a replay will be available through May 3rd. Those listening after today's call should please note that the information provided in the recording will not be updated and therefore may no longer be current. 00:32 I'll now turn the call over to Christopher Evans. Please go ahead, sir.\\nChristopher Evans: 00:36 Thank you and good morning. This is Chris Evans, VP of Investor Relations. We appreciate your continued interest in Axalta and welcome you to our first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Robert Bryant, CEO and Sean Lannon, CFO. 00:55 Yesterday afternoon we released our quarterly financial results and posted a slide presentation along with commentary to the Investor Relations section of our website at axalta.com, which we will be referencing during this call. Both our prepared remarks and discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, reflecting the company's current view of future events and their potential effect on Axalta's operating and financial performance. These statements involve uncertainties and risks and actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements. 01:29 Please note that the company is under no obligation to provide updates to these forward-looking statement. Our remarks and the slide presentation also contain various non-GAAP financial measures. In the appendix to the slide presentation we've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our filings with the SEC. 01:58 I will now turn the call over to Robert.\\nRobert Bryant: 02:01 Thank you, Chris, and good morning. As most probably saw a few weeks ago, Chris Evans recently joined Axalta, the lead Investor Relations and we're very excited to have him as part of our team. 02:13 With that, I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Let me begin by sharing how proud I am of what we have been able to accomplish this quarter and thank our global team for their hard work. Momentum continues to build in each of our businesses today, because of our team's customer focus and dedication to ensure that we deliver on our goal. 02:37 The entire Axalta team deserves credit for fostering growth and minimizing the financial impact of the various geopolitical crises and the ongoing supply chain challenges. I want to specifically call out our China team where essential management and our manufacturing workforce volunteer to shelter in place at our plants and at our customers plants, throughout the weeks long COVID-19 lockdown to keep operations running and meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for your incredible commitment and resiliency. 03:11 Now to the key first quarter highlights on Slide three. We reported a strong result again this quarter and have a lot to be proud of given the overall environment. Constant-currency net sales growth of 13% exceeded our prior estimate in both Performance and Mobility Coatings. Adjusted EBIT of $120 million achieved the very top-end of our guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was above our guidance range given the flow-through of strong earnings, modest benefits from a lower share count, and a slightly lower adjusted tax rate. I'm pleased with these results given the unprecedented degree of challenges, we had to overcome. 03:52 These include, first, the rapid pace of variable cost inflation, which we experienced across most cost categories and well above what we had factored into our original Q1 guidance construct; second, raw material and labor shortages, which created a difficult operating environment constraining many customers in our ability to fully serve a healthy consumer demand environment; and finally, direct and indirect impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic issues, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as the effects of zero COVID policies in China. 04:27 Despite the approximately $22 million in earnings headwinds these three items created versus our January guidance framework we were still able to deliver a solid quarter and exceed our sales guidance, as strong pricing and better volumes yielded better-than-expected 10% year-over-year organic ex-FX growth, and also delivered EBIT at the top end of our range. 04:51 Volume improved 1% year-over-year with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, for the fifth consecutive quarter. Growth was supported by ongoing recovery, as well as from share gains that we are driving across the portfolio. These achievements reflect our customers' preference for our differentiated technologies and our nice recognition of the great work from our commercial teams across all of our business lines. Axalta is committed to driving secular growth and we are making encouraging progress, a stronger share position has allowed us to better leverage our fixed cost position driving higher incremental margins, which will serve us well as markets continue to recover the pre-pandemic levels. 05:35 We realized a remarkable 9% price-mix in the quarter, up from a reported 3.6% last quarter, driven by pricing actions that we have continued to implement in order to offset the impact of cost inflation. Both segments have shown strong pricing gains from past quarters with Mobility Coatings reaching record quarterly percent growth. While we are happy with our pricing progress the unprecedented rate of variable cost inflation was driven Q1 profitability well below our historical low-20s percentage adjusted EBITDA margin range. New pricing actions are already underway to offset existing uncovered and anticipated further inflationary costs coming as a result of higher oil prices and tight supply-demand balances in many commodity chains. 06:25 We expect that our margins will begin to recover in the second quarter as we drive further price improvement and enhance our fixed cost leverage position. During the quarter, we also repurchased $175 million in shares. At the current valuation we see tremendous value in our equity and we'll remain opportunistic as we prioritize capital deployment for generating meaningful shareholder return while balancing a conservative balance sheet. 06:51 Moving onto Slide four. Axalta occupies unique and highly profitable positions in the coating industry. We're aligned with mega trends that we believe create a strong growth trajectory for years to come. However, supply chain challenges have drastically impacted global trade, constrained demand and reduced global GDP. Recent geopolitical dynamics have only increased the temporary strain on global operations and worse than short-term visibility. While we continue to have strong conviction in our strategic ambitions and direction, the degree of macro uncertainty today makes it challenging to forecast beyond the near-term with high confidence. Therefore, we're only providing Q2 guidance today. 07:35 Nonetheless I continue to see strong underlying trends. We're launching new innovative products every quarter and each business is making strong progress toward our growth ambition by executing on topline growth. In Refinish our highly profitable industry leading aftermarket Auto Coatings business, the team is delivering on several strategic imperatives. First, increased market access, this quarter we won over 500 net body shops globally and well over 200 new stock point through distribution customers. Second we're growing our premium market leadership, we are the leader with MSOs, who continued to be allocated more workflow from insurance companies in North America, as well as independent body shops. We are retaining and winning new customers each quarter as we capitalize on our unique customer value proposition. Third, we continue to gain share in mainstream and economy segment, where we haven't had as large of historical presence. 08:38 The addition of new points of distribution is helping to build a sales pipeline in under-represented geographies and markets. We have witnessed good growth progress and execution on all fronts this quarter as evident in our above market volume growth. Another area of focus is the integration of U-POL. We are well underway in integrating the business and executing on cost synergies, but our true enthusiasm for the acquisition is centered around realizing commercial synergies, which we believe will further the U-POL value creation opportunity beyond what we previously communicated. U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in the automotive, body repair business namely in fillers, putties, glazes and aerosols, where Axalta did not participate in a meaningful way. 09:27 Moving into these categories positions us to capture more repair dollars per vehicle. We can also drive commercial synergies through maximizing the cross-selling of Axalta and U-POL products across our global customer base. We're already beginning to see the value creation play out as our distribution partners and key body shop accounts are beginning to stock U-POL products. In addition U-POL gains us exposure to adjacencies in both consumer and industrial protective coatings. 09:58 In Industrial Coatings, we are driving organic growth in a constrained environment led by strong pricing gains. Industrial price-mix increased by a mid-teens percentage year-over-year and by a mid-single digit percentage sequentially. A number of additional pricing actions were instituted in late Q1, which should sustain positive pricing momentum into the remainder of the year reporting a return to significantly higher profitability. 10:24 In Mobility Coatings, our industry-leading light-vehicle and commercial OEM business, we secured record pricing gains and outperformed the market from a volume perspective in Q1. Pricing momentum is building every month. While we are negotiating better pricing we are also building a more inflation resilient portfolio by partnering with our customers to increase the percentage of Mobility customer contracts with indexed pricing mechanisms, now between 35% and 40% for the entire segment. 10:56 Recent share gains and light vehicle are driving above market growth and setting us up with the right customer mix -- when global production returns to normalized levels in the future. In commercial vehicle, we continue to hold the leadership position globally in heavy-duty truck market. We are focused on pricing traction to help offset cost inflation and see strong market demand despite customer production constraints. Lastly, we're driving growth across all end markets with innovative and differentiated product offering. Two new exciting product launches just received recognition with the prestigious 2022 Edison Award, which on are some of the most innovative product developments in the world. Our patented Spies Hecker full waterborne repaired system technology was awarded bronze in Edison sustainability category and represents the first paint offering for the collision repair market where all coatings layers from primer to clear coat are water based. 11:59 This is truly sustainable solution provides best-in-class appearance and performance, while reducing solvent emissions by more than 60%. Next Axalta’s high resolution digital paint coating system won bronze in Edison's material science category. This patent in coating technology supports the mass customization megatrend with a novel coating it can be applied with zero over spray and reduces energy consumption as well as waste generated from the masking process. These are just two great examples of Axalta's innovation pipeline and product differentiation, which we are supporting customers productivity needs in sustainability ambitions, creating a large market pull for our offering. 12:44 Turning to Slide five and six for a discussion of key market and demand trends. Vehicle miles traveled in the United States and Europe have nearly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but changes in driving behavior, namely the prevalence of work-from-home, seems to have led to lower congestion levels and less collision claims than before the start of the pandemic. Based on paint consumption data from our proprietary e-commerce platform we estimate Q1 body shop activity remained in the mid-80s% and low 90s% respectively for the US and Europe relative to 2019, consistent with the level of collision claims. 13:23 Within the quarter our U.S. body shop customers reported a step-up in activity during March that we believe reflected some modest market improvement though remains constrained by a growing backlog of repair work given parts and labor shortages at the body-shop level. We believe that return to in-person work is an important factor in driving market recovery and are encouraged by U.S. office occupancy, which improved from the low 20s% to 42% versus prior year. 13:55 In Industrial coatings, a healthy demand environment was again limited by supply constraints, namely in Building Products and General Industrial. In total these constraints represented a mid-to-high single digit percent drag against our 1% volume growth in the period. Regionally North America and Asia Pacific contributed most significantly to our year-over-year growth. 14:19 Moving to Mobility Coatings, the expected normalization of global auto production rates in 2022 has been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as China COVID-19 lockdowns, resulting in downward revisions of earlier production estimates. Full-year 2022 global production industry estimates are now forecasted to be 80.6 million, 4% above 2021, but still 9% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. 14:50 Once supply chain constraints and cost headwinds abate the benefit to Axalta will be significant. This is highlighted by an approximately $140 million earnings gap between our trailing 12-month Mobility Coatings Adjusted EBIT and our pre-pandemic 2019 profitability levels, when global auto builds reached 89 million. We're not sitting still and waiting for the market to recover. In the current environment we focus on what we can control, prioritizing productivity, better price to offset cost inflation, and new market gains. Following these actions, we expect to be in an even better position once supply chain constraints diminish and the market recovers. 15:36 In Commercial Vehicle, where we have an industry-leading share in North America and EMEA, strong demand is outpacing constrained production rates. Heavy-duty and medium-duty truck order backlog is now 11-months and eight months, respectively, creating a long-dated growth dynamic for production rates to climb beyond 2022. 15:56 Moving to Slide seven, I’ll cover price cost and our focus on margin recovery. First, I’d like to remind everyone that we have a successful history of managing inflationary periods and quickly recovering loss profitability, our business is resilient. We have the ability to increase price when it's needed. 16:15 From the chart on this slide you can get a sense of the pace of inflation we have experienced. Even though this inflationary period is uniquely rapid and broad-based, we are already making great progress towards offsetting the impact. 16:28 In Performance Coatings, we have been able to quickly raise price and have offset the majority of the $220 million cumulative year-over-year variable cost and logistics inflation incurred since the second of 2021. In Mobility Coatings, lagging index pricing mechanisms in some contracts, and multi-quarter pricing discussions in others, mean we have begun to accelerate pricing. Every business at Axalta is focused on margin recovery and we expect to cover the majority of existing price cost gaps and incremental headwinds by Q4 of this year at the consolidated level. 17:07 Before I turn the call over to Sean to discuss our financial results, I wanted to touch briefly on some ESG highlights from the quarter on Slide eight. As you may remember we announced our 2030 ESG goals in January, which reflect how meaningful progress in environmental, social and corporate governance is central to Axalta’s strategy and success. We have already begun to execute against these goals and have engaged with many of our customers and other stakeholders to discuss our plans. 17:36 A major commitment is for us to develop new sustainable technologies and increase the proportion of our sales and sustainable solutions. As many of our mobility customers are rapidly shifting to produce more electric vehicles we're aligning our technology to support them and to drive growth in our own business. Our new AquaEC Flex product for the mobility sector is a great example of our technology and innovation investments being deeply connected with key sustainability mega trends. In addition to the two Edison Award products, I mentioned this product enables our OEM customers to reduce CO2 emissions in their own operations by lowering the temperatures required for an electric vehicles more intricate body frame. This is a great launch for us, well aligned with our ESG commitment. 18:25 Now I'll turn the call over to Sean to discuss our financial results beginning with Slide nine.\\nSean Lannon: 18:30 Thanks, Robert, and good morning. As you heard the first quarter delivered strong pricing execution with contributions from across the portfolio. Healthy demand environment supported volume growth, but the continuation of supply constraints was a headwind and also contributed to further challenges from cost inflation. 18:48 Net sales of $1.2 billion increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter, while constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by pricing actions, demand strength across most of our businesses, and benefits from two acquisitions we completed in 2021. 19:05 Constant currency net sales growth included a 19% increase from Performance Coatings and 3% growth from Mobility Coatings, reflecting Light Vehicle up 1% while Commercial Vehicle was up an impressive 10%. First quarter volume improved 1% with positive contribution from three of four end-markets, offset by a low single-digits percent decline in Light Vehicle volumes, which outpaced the approximate 5% decline in global Q1 auto production. 19:34 Price-mix contribution increased 9% in the aggregate, up from our reported 3.6% last quarter, with improvement across all end-markets led by mid-teens improvement in Industrial Coatings. FX translation was a headwind of 3% for Q1, driven by the weaker Euro and Turkish Lira. 19:53 First quarter Adjusted EBIT was $120 million versus $183 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting pricing actions, strong demand, and volume trends across all end-markets except Light Vehicle, which was more than offset by substantial increases in raw material and logistics cost inflation realized versus the first quarter of 2021. I did want to note that we took a $6 million accounting charge associated with accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence reserves, and these are excluded from our adjusted EBIT stemming from sanctions imposed on Russia. 20:28 Turning to Slide 10. Performance Coatings Q1 net sales increased 15.1% year-over-year and 18.6% ex-FX, driven by 2.5% higher volumes, a 10.7% increase in average price-mix, up from the 4.6% reported last quarter, and a 5.4% increase from acquisitions. 20:50 Refinish reported a 15.6% net sales increase, or 19.7% ex-FX, driven by a high single-digit price-mix benefits, above-market volume growth, and by a high single-digit contribution from the U-POL acquisition. Volumes increased in every region despite raw material supply impacting our ability to meet all of our demand with the exception of China, where COVID-19 lockdowns drove a modest volume decline. 21:17 Industrial Q1 net sales increased 14.5%, or 17.3% ex-FX, driven largely by mid-teens percent improvement in average price-mix, as well as a low single-digit acquisition contribution, and slightly positive volume growth. Demand trends in most of the Industrial end-businesses we serve remained healthy during the period; though supply constraints were a limiting factor, representing a high-single digit percent drag on sales. 21:46 Performance Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $95 million versus $117 million in Q1 2021, driven by ongoing volume growth and drop through benefits of price-mix, which were more than offset by headwinds from higher variable costs. The adjusted EBIT margin for the segment decreased to 11.6% from 16.6% in the prior-year period given the drivers noted. 22:11 Moving to Slide 11. Mobility Coatings net sales increased 3% in Q1 ex-FX, including a 4.9% price-mix tailwind offset by 1.9% lower volumes. The 1.9% volume decreases improved markedly from the 11% decrease last quarter thanks to stronger demand from our customer base, including new business starting to come on line. 22:35 Light Vehicle net sales increased 1% ex-FX in the quarter, including a 3.5% volume decrease, which outperformed a global auto production decline of approximately 5%. Price increased by mid single-digits. Commercial Vehicle Q1 net sales increased 10% ex-FX, driven by strong truck production globally, excluding China. Price-mix also increased mid single-digits. 23:01 Mobility Coatings reported Q1 adjusted EBIT of $1 million versus $39 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBIT and associated margins in Q1 were impacted by variable cost inflation, with only modest offsets and positive pricing. Pricing gains are accelerating and we expect to cover the majority of incremental variable cost inflation between Q2 and Q4. 23:23 Moving to our debt and liquidity summary on Slide 12. Axalta’s Q1 balance sheet and liquidity profile remained solid. We ended the quarter with slightly over $1.1 billion in total liquidity. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1 times, reflecting an increase from 3.5 times at December 31st. Net leverage remains somewhat elevated due to the seasonal phasing of free cash flow and share repurchases totaling $175 million in the quarter. We continue to expect this to drop as we move to the back end of the year on stronger full-year operating results and normal free cash flow generation. 24:00 On Slide 13, we'll review Q2 guidance and full-year commentary. For the second quarter net sales we expect between 11% and 13% year-over-year growth, including a 4% FX headwinds and a 4% positive M&A contribution. The top line guide assumes low double-digit better pricing, continuing the acceleration of gains we've seen in recent quarters. Our forecast also includes a 2% to 3% sales headwind from China COVID lock-downs and from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 24:33 We expect to generate adjusted EBIT of $135 million to $165 million in the second quarter. With D&A of approximately $80 million inclusive of $24 million of step up D&A. Interest expense for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately $34 million, where adjusted earnings per share we anticipate a range of $0.35 to $0.45 for the second quarter inclusive of an FX headwind of $0.02 per share. Within our second quarter forecast, we further assume raw material inflation in the high '20s as a percentage versus Q2, 2021. 25:11 As we look for the full-year, it remains challenging to provide a detailed forecast given the degree of supply chain and geopolitical uncertainty. Nonetheless looking ahead, we expect strong mid-teens annual organic growth in both Performance and Mobility Coatings, driven by pricing actions already being executed and volume growth from modest market recoveries and share gains. 25:34 We are encouraged by refinish recovery given improved vehicle miles driven and upward trending office occupancy rates. But we remain measured in our outlook as we monitor the possible impacts from regional and global impacts from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as impacts from the extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China. 25:53 For mobility global auto build rates have been revised lower month-after-month by industry consultants and have settled close to our current 80 million production rate assumption, which is slightly above the 79 million we last forecasted. At these levels, we expect to see annual volume uplift from market growth plus upside from new customer wins. Likewise global medium-duty and heavy-duty truck build rates are projected to increase 4% in 2022, ex-China with our commercial vehicle volumes likely to exceed market rates given our strong and growing positions. 26:28 Regarding cost factors, our current assessment is that rates of overall raw material and cost inflation will continue at high levels. Given current baseline expectations and assuming Brent crude between $110 and $115 per barrel. We expect to largely cover the existing price cost gap and incremental headwinds this year with some lag in Mobility Coatings being offset by strength in Performance Coatings. Altogether, we anticipate stronger earnings performance this year versus 2021. 26:58 Lastly, our typical second half weighted distribution of operating cash flow and a favorable outlook for sequential earnings growth should reduce our net leverage considerably by year-end.\\nRobert Bryant: 27:10 Thank you, Sean. It was indeed a remarkable quarter. Our teams delivered very strong organic growth and remain focused on driving margin recovery with additional pricing actions underway in every business. I believe that we are laying the groundwork to deliver substantial earnings growth as supply chain constraints wane and end markets recover. 27:32 With that, we'll be pleased to answer any questions. Operator, could you please open the lines for Q&A.\\nOperator: 27:40 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\\nChris Parkinson: 28:09 Great, thank you so much. Robert your team is taking out a lot of cost over the years. I think most investors understand there -- obviously could be further volatility in variable costs. But just -- could you just help us and perhaps Sean as well just how should we be thinking about the broad framework for incremental margins as volumes fully recover especially mobility and if you want to hit on the intermediate and the long term next one or two years that would be very helpful, thank you.\\nRobert Bryant: 28:37 Chris, as we look at our cost structure as you point out, we've made great strides over the past couple of years, especially during the COVID period, where we took a lot of structural cost out of the business. We now feel that we have the cost structure where we want it, and the biggest lever is really going to be the return of volume and leveraging our operating model. So as we see volumes come back and costs abate the drop-through will actually be very attractive for our business.\\nChris Parkinson: 29:13 Got it. And just a quick follow-up just -- relative to all of our own end market assumptions, can you just discuss Axalta’s ability to outperformance respective end markets starting with light vehicle, especially given some of your new business wins? And just perhaps obviously just a structural longevity as the refinish market and key themes of industrial that would also be particularly helpful, just so we can get a hand on the growth, I'll go over the next one or two years. Thank you so much.\\nRobert Bryant: 29:42 Yes, so if we look at things overall, I think we're seeing strong underlying market demand really across the board, within our different businesses and really the primary issue right now are just supply constraints as it is for everyone. I mean within refinish market conditions continue to be supportive, but supply constraints are somewhat limiting our ability to fully serve demand. We do believe that there is recovery coming and we're starting to see that as office occupancy rates tick back up as we highlighted from the low-20% in the U.S. last year or two 42% this quarter and that should lead to more congestion on the roads. So I think our expectation continues to be that we'll see the refinish market recover to pre-pandemic levels and we again remain very bullish on that business. 30:32 And I’ve highlight with the acquisition of U-POL we just have a wonderful opportunity to leverage our sales and distribution channels further by pushing additional products and services through existing sales and distribution channel. So that's also an added plus to the secular direction of the refinish business. Within Industrial, very happy to see the strong sequential volume growth, as well as robust pricing gains that led to the 15% sales increase. If we look at some of the markets within Industrial just in the first quarter Building Product sales were, up 22%; Energy Solutions sales were, up 25%; and General Industrial was, up 11% for the quarter versus the prior year. So with that just highlights is that we're executing extremely well against our strategic plan, which was to accelerate growth in Building Products and Energy Solutions and further build out our platform in Energy Solutions, which we'll be talking more about in the future. 31:38 And with regard to Mobility, Mobility showing strong signs of return as we see sequential year-over-year volume improvement. Obviously, it's still early, but as global production improves and then also the new wins that we had last year and that we continue to generate this year come to fruition. The one area to really highlight there is our sequential price improvement. And again, I would just highlight that in that business -- our business includes only exterior body paint as we define it. But there are elements of the automotive business -- automotive OE business that actually reside within Industrial, where we had 15% price capture, therefore on a like-for-like basis with some of our peers, our actual price capture in Mobility was much higher.\\nChris Parkinson: 32:33 Very helpful color. Thank you so much.\\nOperator: 32:37 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\\nJohn McNulty: 32:44 Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So in the Mobility business you had commented you're about $140 million behind, kind of, where you were pre-COVID. I guess can you help us to understand how much of that is volume driven? And how much of that is price versus raws as you're starting to, kind of, see the acceleration in pricing and starting to catch up, maybe how much of that we can narrow back down even without a recovery in the volumes? I guess, can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 33:14 Yes. John, it's probably 50-50 going back to 2019 levels, we are at 89 million builds. Certainly the controllable right now is catching up on price and clearly you saw that momentum pick up from fourth quarter of the first quarter, you're going to see it again essentially double in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter. But once we get back to sort of that 89 million, 90 million builds, you know, coupled with the fact of pricing traction you're going to see the effect into Chris Parkinson's earlier question, the volumes are camouflage and all the progress we've made from a cost structure perspective, so it's really going to help margins when we get back to those levels.\\nJohn McNulty: 33:53 Got it, got it. No, that makes sense. And then from a capital allocation perspective, so the buyback was kind of off the charts, at least relative to kind of how we were expecting things to play out at least in the quarter. I guess can you speak to how much of that was just the buying opportunity just given how weak the stock had been earlier in the quarter versus how much is around your confidence and the ability to squeeze out more cash as the year goes on to kind of further, kind of, fill up or strengthen the balance sheet and get your kind of, cash flows back on track again? And can you help us to think about that?\\nRobert Bryant: 34:35 The magnitude of the buyout that you saw in the first quarter was really a reflection of how undervalued. We believe our equity was and as we’d always stated we would have a stock repurchase program that would offset dilution, plus an additional few percentage points each year. However, we would remain opportunistic and if we ever really saw a dislocation in the intrinsic value of the company and the equity price that we would step in and step in strongly, and that's what you saw in the first quarter.\\nSean Lannon: 35:07 Yes. And John on your point on cash flow getting back on track. I mean 2020 we did over $440 million, last year we did $455 million. So we've been dropping through cash flow over 50% of EBITDA. So we're happy with the progress we're making, we're confident we're going to delever as long as we don't do anything big on the M&A front. So we're -- again we're being opportunistic given where the share price sits in the first quarter, but we expect the normal seasonality of cash flow build in the back half of 2022.\\nJohn McNulty: 35:37 Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.\\nOperator: 35:42 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\\nMatt Krieger: 35:49 Hi, everyone. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krieger on the line, sitting in for Ghansham. My first question is obviously you delivered results that were ahead of your initial first quarter expectations. But can you talk about some of the key variances relative to your initial guide that drove that? And how those variances have fared as we've moved into early 2Q?\\nSean Lannon: 36:15 Yes. I mean volume was probably the bright spot on the light vehicle side, we had initially assumed 17 million global builds, IHS came in closer to 19.5 million builds and certainly, we benefited from outperforming the actual overall market. We saw volume improvement also within the performance side of the business and then the other bright spot is clearly pricing we were initially expecting around 7% price, we got upwards of 9%, but that has actually offset the impacts that we saw with Russia and the China dynamics, as well as the fact that we saw incrementally about $20 million in variable logistics and variable raw material costs.\\nRobert Bryant: 37:00 Yes, I would just add to what Sean said Matt to the second part of your question regarding April conditions. I think when you look at what we accomplished in the first quarter, it's really impressive, I mean we would have had a blow out quarter had we not had the incremental headwinds and approximately $22 million more in earnings. And I think that's worth noting, but thus far in April top line sales conditions really appear to be similar to what we've seen on -- in the first quarter. And on the cost side, we're seeing oil trade slightly better than our guidance outlook, but the price does remain pretty volatile. So that could be the other variable as we think about the second quarter. We're also closely monitoring the developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation in China, but really at this time April hasn't given us much of a reason to move guidance up or down at this point.\\nMatt Krieger: 37:56 Great. That's definitely helpful. And then just focusing on the bottom line here, can you provide some added detail on what a realistic timeline for price cost parity across your various business units might look like? And then expanding on that, what level of pricing do we need to see across your portfolio to offset the level of inflation that you're currently experiencing in the high '20s range? Is that mid-teens pricing, high teens pricing, 20% plus pricing flow through. Give us a sense of what we should be looking for from that perspective?\\nSean Lannon: 38:32 So if we hit average oil and there is not a perfect correlation with all the raw material baskets, but if average oil for 2022 is up around $115 per barrel, we're going to need to get almost 10% price to offset exiting 2021, we had roughly at $70 million gap including logistics. We had called out roughly $50 million just raw materials, but we're solving for the full cost stack for the full-year.\\nMatt Krieger: 39:01 Great. That's helpful, thanks.\\nOperator: 39:07 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\\nPJ Juvekar: 39:15 Yes. Hi, good morning, you know, question on your industrial business, you got really good pricing there, volumes were a bit soft due to supply chain issues. So it seems like the underlying demand was still strong, but you had some -- the supply chain issues. But the question on this underlying demand with Europe slowing down with the war and China shut downs recently with COVID, how do you see the underlying demand perform for rest of the year?\\nRobert Bryant: 39:46 I think is -- there is a question of underlying demand and then there's a question of what we're able to supply. And just given the mix of raw materials, as well as the overall volume of the Industrial business, that's really the inhibitor, PJ. But if you look at the demand profile of the business, demand was exceptionally strong in North America in particular and we’d again we talk about each one of our unique businesses. We did see Building products, as well as energy solutions grow quite strongly and even Industrial -- general industrial being up being up 11%. Could we see some softness in particular in the general industrial business in Europe, just given some of the pressures there? 40:36 Yes, we could see some softness there, I think it's too early to really tell, but I think the other -- each one of the regions is stronger and each one of the individual industrial segments. So they do kind of balance each other out somewhat. And it's also just important to remember that it's a very highly fragmented customer base, so we are able to increase price. And it does also give us some insulation from some of those macro trends.\\nPJ Juvekar: 41:06 Great, thank you. And can you talk about your battery coatings products for EVs at the PAT level? And what's in the pipeline there? And what would you say your market share is in that business?\\nRobert Bryant: 41:18 Let highlight that in particular, I know you're asking about batteries. But we're really one of the top companies in the world when it comes to electric motors in our Energy Solutions business or Energy Solutions Coatings for which we've won multiple Technology Awards they're used in electric motors and vehicles, industrial applications, wind turbines, transmission towers, electrical conduits, but also fuel storage containers, battery trays, closures and covers. And so we have now leveraged our Energy Solutions business to grow into battery cells, battery modules and battery packs. 41:58 Now that being said, we see a much larger opportunity in the global electrification market and we'll be talking about that more in the future. And in terms of market share at this point, it's a nascent, but a quickly growing market share.\\nPJ Juvekar: 42:18 Thank you.\\nOperator: 42:22 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\\nAlex Yefremov: 42:30 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert you mentioned some new wins in Mobility, could you discuss how are you pricing those wins? Are they being done at margins sort of similar to what we see today in the segment? Or some normalized level of how you make sure that there is good return in capital for those new deals?\\nRobert Bryant: 42:51 Sure, at a variable contribution level we've been pricing all of our new business at what we have historically deemed to be attractive levels, and I would say that are reflective of current market conditions. And in particular the business that we have won in China has been at very attractive margins.\\nSean Lannon: 43:12 And Alex just on return on invested capital, I mean, we don't necessarily need to invest additional assets, I mean, we're essentially filling up our plants with the volume. So as far as the incrementals on those, they're also very attractive.\\nRobert Bryant: 43:26 I mean that really just your question, I think the increasing sales in Mobility has really been through our technology, our customer intimacy and relationships and frankly our service. And our team in Mobility in particular in Asia has just been doing an outstanding job.\\nAlex Yefremov: 43:46 Thank you, very helpful. Turning to Refinish it sounds like your customers continue to pay shortages of materials and personnel. Do you have any insight weather these issues are getting better not getting better? Or and what could be the pace of improvement here for the rest of the year?\\nRobert Bryant: 44:12 It does still remain an issue for body shops in particular in the U.S., anecdotally we have heard over the last month that it has been getting better, but again I would characterize that is anecdotal as opposed to data driven.\\nAlex Yefremov: 44:29 Got it. Thanks a lot.\\nOperator: 44:34 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\\nKevin McCarthy: 44:41 Yes, good morning, Robert in your prepared remarks, you referenced company stronger share position and you went on to allude to penetration in the economy segment of Refinish and it sounds like you picked up some share in Mobility. Is there a way to size how much volume uplift you might be enjoying in those businesses or perhaps other businesses where you've gained share relative to underlying market growth?\\nRobert Bryant: 45:12 Well, I think we take a look at volume in particular and if we look at volume in the first quarter at least, our volume growth was the strongest in Refinish in particular in North America and Latin America followed by commercial vehicle in EMEA and Latin America. And then industrial in North America and then as we've highlighted our light vehicle business in China. And our penetration, I think would have been even greater of we have had sufficient raw materials. If you think about it, the lack of raw materials is kind of left us with a current backlog in Refinish and Industrial of approximately $50 million, which is about 4% of Q1 sales. So we actually had even more demand and potentially could have had even more share, if we have been able to get our hands on those raw materials. 46:09 So I think the team is doing a great job, not only in the Mobility business, but also in the Industrial business and in Refinish. And in Refinish, as we've highlighted the mainstream in the economy segments have been areas of focus for us and we've made in particular good inroads there in Latin America with a new business model, as well as with China and U-POL only allows us to further leverage that position, because most of U-POL sales and distribution network goes to more mainstream and economy sites, which has allowed us from a cross-selling perspective to more deeply penetrate with our Refinish products, as well as getting our U-POL products into more of our distribution, as well as some of our larger body shops in Europe and in the US.\\nKevin McCarthy: 47:05 And then secondly, if I may, can you comment on what you saw in China in the first quarter in both here in auto and industrial businesses? And what was the trajectory as COVID re-surged in March into early April, curious as to your thoughts on the underlying economy there?\\nRobert Bryant: 47:30 I think when you look again at underlying demand in China, demand there has remained really strong. The lockdowns however have made it more challenging to service our customers, but our team there has been doing a great job keeping customers running, even if it's meant living at their sites, which they've voluntarily been doing. So I think we feel really good about what's going on there. On the Mobility side, again, we’ve made some changes from an organizational perspective over the last 18-months, that have really helped us more deeply penetrate the market in particular with Chinese domestics, we've had a pretty significant amount of growth in China. 48:14 And then on the Industrial side, we've also brought in new talent over the past year with very specific domain expertise in the industrial markets that are the largest and play best with our technology portfolio in China and they've also made really, really good inroads. Now in terms of the financial impact as we look at the quarter the COVID-19 lockdowns in China we saw really kind of create a relatively modest headwind in Q1. We expect it to be a little bit more material in Q2 with the shutdowns, so the April results we expect to be most impacted as the lockdowns are kind of in full swing in Shanghai. But we expect the business should start to normalize in May, unless we see COVID spread to other areas and then our guidance assumption is kind of, if there is a full return to normal operations in June. If the lockdowns are lifted. So again all of that depends on the trajectory of where we go from here. Again as a reminder, China is about 10% of our annual sales and we've assumed about a 1.5 month impact in the second quarter.\\nKevin McCarthy: 49:34 That's really helpful. Thank you, Robert.\\nOperator: 49:40 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nVincent Andrews: 49:47 Thank you and good morning everyone. Just wanted to get a little more insight into the 35% to 40% of the index pricing, you have now, which is up from prior indication. Where are you looking to get that figure? And what is it that's driving those customers onto those contracts versus the ones that are staying often. Is it new folks that are coming in where you have new wins? Or is it you're converting existing customers or both. And as a follow-up to that, just when we get to a period of deflation, which hopefully eventually we will get to presumably those contracts will automatically reset on some timeframe, but then you'll be looking to hold on to price in the balance of the business. Maybe just wanted to sort of get some insight into that interplay?\\nRobert Bryant: 50:39 The optimal level of -- I’d say the optimal level of index contracts is difficult to say, it's really more of a customer preference. There are some customers that prefer to have an index contracts in place, it just makes the amount of time that we as well as our customers spend on price negotiations, run a lot more smoothly every, every customer is different and every purchasing organization within each OEM is different, some prefer not to have an index contracts and just to have price negotiations verbally. So it's really more a function of what our customer preferences are. 51:19 Most of the contracts on average have about a six-month adjustment. So for example, July 1st we'll see an adjustment to the majority of the index contracts that will start to see that flow through at the beginning of the third quarter. And then likewise, if you were to see raw material prices come down, you would see those prices come down six months later. I think the important element to emphasize there is the through cycle profitability and so as we've structured these arrangements with our customers, we have tried to put them through the mid-point of the cycle on attractive level of profitability for us, which we think we've achieved in terms of how we've structured those contract. And in particular, you know, versus the amount of value that we actually create for our OEM customers, which as you know is quite substantial.\\nVincent Andrews: 52:13 And then maybe just a follow-up on U-POL, I think you've had the business since September and obviously it's been a tricky time with raw materials and pricing. Have they been able to be as nimble as you've wanted them to be? Or if you had to come in with best practices or just how is pricing going with the acquisition?\\nSean Lannon: 52:29 Yes. So, I mean as far as the integration activities are going very well, I mean we're essentially seven months into the journey right now. On the cost side, we only had roughly $10 million of synergies, we're well on track. We have targeted 12 to 18-months on that front. So we're in good shape on the cost side. As far as the commercial synergies and Robert covered this a bit in his prepared remarks but we're making really good progress as far as integrating their commercial teams and really driving those efforts and actually seeing the progress. The expectation pre-all the additional pricing we are expecting to do high-teens as far as growth rates and slightly higher than that from an EBITDA perspective. With the additional pricing, we expect to be north of that, but I would characterize U-POL very similar to the overall Refinish with good pricing hour and we’ll make good progress on that front.\\nVincent Andrews: 53:23 Great, thank you very much.\\nOperator: 53:27 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Sison: 53:33 Hey guys, good morning. In terms of mobility you -- at the 80.6 million auto build outlook that you have for ’22, is there good improvement in the second half? Is pricing catches up? Or are we still sort of at this breakeven point given you gave us an outlook for the auto build?\\nSean Lannon: 53:54 Yes, we will be making steady progress as we work through the year. We're expecting volumes to continue to pick up sequentially, coupled with the fact that pricing will start to outpace that the COGS inflation rates.\\nMike Sison: 54:11 Got it. And then yes, no just as a quick follow-up on the business, there's not a lot of businesses I don't think that are kind of losing money in Coatings and I think that's probably for everybody. But is this a good business for Axalta longer term given how cyclical it's been. I understand it's been kind of weird unprecedented times, but when you think about where you could redeploy potentially and I know timing is a bad? Is this something that you should hold onto or maybe the vast at some point and then invest in things in Performance Coatings, which is held up a lot better?\\nRobert Bryant: 54:50 I think to answer your question, we have to look at kind of the moment in history that we are right now, which is fairly, fairly unprecedented. I think if you take COVID and then on top of COVID, you ask -- you add massive cost inflation and then you add a semiconductor shortage and then on top of that, you add supply chain issues. It does create a rather unique point in history that we would certainly hope would never be repeated. As we think about the business over the longer term again, we think that over the next five years once those conditions ameliorate, we are going to see secular demand that is going to make this business an extremely strong performer within our portfolio. The lack of inventory at OEMs at dealer life, the need of car rental companies to replenish their fleets, there's just a tremendous amount of secular demand. 55:51 In addition to the continued conversion from Ice vehicles to electric vehicles where we have additional content per vehicle that will also be an impetus and is the business changes in works, we also have some additional technologies, as well as some additional areas of market focus that we think are going to even improve potentially the margin profile of the business to that of a higher level than sort of the 2016, 2017 period. So again, as far as Light Vehicle we do remain positive on that business. It's just a tough point in time when you have this many exogenous variables go against you.\\nSean Lannon: 56:32 And Mike, I just -- I did want to call out one point, because I think some folks lose sight of this, light vehicle is still EBITDA positive. EBIT has been impacted by all the depreciation and amortization from the carve-out from DuPont back in ’13, but it's still is generating cash and I did want to highlight that point.\\nMike Sison: 56:51 Got it. Thank you.\\nOperator: 56:55 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\\nMike Leithead: 57:02 Great, thanks, good morning guys. Just one from me, I wanted to circle back to John's earlier question on the buyback. Robert, you obviously talked about finding great value in your equity price in 1Q. And when I just look at your current share price, it's maybe I don't know 10-ish percent below your average acquired price in 1Q? So should we expect healthy buybacks to continue into 2Q here?\\nSean Lannon: 57:26 So we're not providing discrete guidance on that. I think we're going to remain opportunistic, we also are keeping an eye on M&A activities, as well as deleveraging over time. But it's certainly on the agenda that continue to look at.\\nMike Leithead: 57:44 I guess maybe a different way to come at it we have your average 1Q share diluted count. What did the quarter end that, I'm just trying to back into your 2Q shares outstanding guidance there? Thanks.\\nRobert Bryant: 57:59 So we acquired 6.4 million shares, we got roughly a $4 million diluted average benefit in the first quarter and we're expecting Q2 guide to be at $2.22. I'm not sure if I answered your question precisely, there.\\nMike Leithead: 58:17 No, I think that's helpful. We can follow-up offline. Thank you.\\nOperator: 58:22 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\\nLucas Beaumont: Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. I just wanted to go back to the contract re-pricing in Light Vehicle if we could. So could you tell us sort of roughly how much of your contracts have sort of been repriced already today? And how much you expect to be re-priced by the end of the year, please?\\nRobert Bryant: 58:46 The way to think about that is that the contracts vary and linked between three and four years. So in any given year there is about 25% to 33% of the contracts that are coming up for quote or for rebidding. So you have an built-in price adjuster of about a quarter of the business at least kind of every year as business is rebid and requited. The other element to keep in mind is that the color palette of all so as you might have a given vehicle platform is there is a color change? Of course, you'll be repricing those colors at current economics.\\nLucas Beaumont: 59:29 Great, thanks. And then, so just thinking about if mobility markets going to fail to improve or end up remaining like a strain for a number of additional quarters. Do you guys have any like contingency plans, where you would think about taking any temporary or sort of permanent cost actions. I guess how meaningful could that be? Or it gives you more, you would just wait it out until we sort of get through it? Thanks.\\nSean Lannon: 59:58 So at this point, you know, over the last two years, we've done a fair amount of reductions both structural, as well as holding on the -- some of the temporary savings. So unless we saw a significant demand destruction, I think we're in a pretty good place, right now it's just to focus on price. And I think what you're going to see in the second quarter is a nice uptick and price realization to continue to help our margins.\\nOperator: 60:28 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. This concludes our Q&A session and does concludes our call today. We thank you for your interest and participation. You may now disconnect your lines.\",\n",

My name is Alex and I will be coordinating the call today.  00:24 I will now hand over to your host Nikki Sparley, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Nikki.\\nNikki Sparley: 00:31Thank you, Alex. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. As a reminder, some things that will be said this morning contain forward-looking statements. They are based on management's assumptions which may or may not occur. For a complete list of cautionary statements, refer to the language at the end of our press release. We expect to file our 10-Q later today. As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call. Please note, these calls are designed for the financial community. If you are an investor and have additional questions after the call, please contact me directly at (503) 721-2530. News media may contact David Roy at (503) 610-7157. 01:22 Speaking this morning are David Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Burkhartsmeyer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David and Frank have prepared remarks and then will be available along with other members of our executive team to answer your questions. 01:39 With that, I will turn it over to David.\\nDavid Anderson: 01:41 Thanks, Nikki. And good morning, everybody and welcome. We started off the year strong and in line with our expectations. Our financial results were solid and we continue to make progress on all key objectives. We reported net income today of $1.80 per share in the first quarter compared to net income of $1.94 per share for the same period last year. 02:01 Results for 2021 include a $0.09 per share benefit related to severe cold weather event in February last year. Setting that aside, financial results in 2022 were driven by new rates in Washington and customer growth, as well as continued growth in expenses as we invest in our natural gas utility system. 02:21 We also see positive momentum in our local Portland Metro area economy, the strong labor market helped to drive unemployment down to near historic lows. Unemployment rates in Oregon declined to 3.8% in March 2022, compared to 6.1% a year ago. Single-family housing activity remains robust. The average sales price of a home was up over 10% for the first quarter of March 2022 compared to last year. Single-family permits issued were up almost 3% in Oregon through February 2022, compared to the prior period. Construction and development remained robust in our region. 02:59 We continue to see a healthy pipeline of conversions to natural gas in single-family homes. In the last 12 months, 2,200 customers have converted in our service territory. These conversions, along with new construction translated into nearly 11,000 customers connected to our gas system during the last 12 months. That equates to a growth rate of about 1.4%. 03:21 Our water and wastewater utilities also continue to grow. Strong residential housing construction primarily in Idaho and Texas translated into a 3.1% organic customer growth rate over the last 12 months ended March 31. The combination of this organic growth and acquisitions resulted in a 27% increase in our water utility connections. 03:43 Turning to our decarbonization activities. We continue to make progress under the landmark Oregon Senate Bill 98 legislation which supports renewable energy procurement and investment by natural gas utilities. In January this year, Northwest Natural reached an important milestone as the first RNG facility with Tyson Foods and BioCarbN began operations. Northwest Natural is the first local gas distribution utility in the Continental United States to invest in and own an RNG facility on behalf of all of its sales customers as we work to decarbonize our gas portfolio. 04:21 Construction of our second facility has begun with commission slated for early 2023. To date, we signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG on behalf of our customers, totaling about 3% of Northwest Natural's current annual sales volume in Oregon. I am very proud of the progress we've made in less than two years. To put that into perspective, today wind and solar account for about 12% of our nation's electric supply, after decades of investment. In March we also interconnected an RNG facility in Eugene, Oregon to our system. We're excited to keep flowing renewables through our own pipeline system here in Oregon. 05:01 Reflecting our dedication to decarbonization, Northwest Natural was recently made an environmental champion among 140 of the largest utilities in a national study by Escalent. I'm proud of our customers' recognition of our dedication and leadership in this area and thank them greatly. 05:18 With that, let me turn it over to Frank to cover the financials of the quarter.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 05:21 Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing the highlights of the first quarter of 2022 results and conclude with guidance for the year. I'll describe the earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. 05:36 As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of the revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months. 05:45 For the quarter, we reported net income of $56.2 million or $1.80 per share compared to net income of $59.5 million or $1.94 for the same period in 2021, a decline of $0.14 per share. The decrease in net income largely reflects the $2.8 million or $0.09 per share benefit of the February 2021 cold weather event. The gas utility posted a $0.01 per share increase in earnings, while results from our other businesses declined $0.15 per share. 06:16 Higher earnings at the gas utility were primarily related to new rates in Washington, customer growth and an improvement in the results from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as the prior year included the effect of purchasing higher-priced gas during the February weather event. As a result of these factors, utility margin increased $3.7 million. 06:36 Utility O&M increased $3.5 million, reflecting higher levels of expense from payroll, contractor and professional services and IT upgrades. Utility depreciation and general taxes increased $900,000 due to higher property, plant and equipment as we continue to invest in our system. Other income increased $1.9 million, driven by lower pension costs. Net income from our other businesses decreased $4.7 million as the prior period benefited from higher asset management revenues related to the cold weather event. 07:08 For 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $141 million, an increase of $4 million compared to last year. We invested $70 million into the business, most of which was for gas utility and capital expenditures. On April 1, we completed an equity offering and received approximately $140 million of proceeds to support our growing businesses. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity. 07:34 Moving on to financial guidance. The company reaffirmed 2022 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share. Guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations. We continue to target our long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6%. 08:01 With that, I'll turn the call back over to David.\\nDavid Anderson: 08:04 Thanks, Frank. We continue to progress and execute on our business strategy. Our focus is maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated gas utilities and positioning our business for incremental long-term growth by investment in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas business. 08:21 In addition to moving our gas utility towards a renewable future, last year we also launched a competitive renewable natural gas strategy. We're committed to leading in the energy transition and providing renewable natural gas to the utility, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors. We're focused on providing cost-effective solutions to help these sectors decarbonize, while existing waste streams and renewable energy sources were using the existing waste streams and renewable energy sources. 08:51 As you know, we've already taken our first steps with the 20-year RNG supply agreement and a total of $50 million committed investment in two RNG facilities. Construction has begun on both of those facilities and we expect them to be placed into service in early 2023. At the end of January, Mike Kotick joined our team to lead our competitive RNG efforts. In just a few short months, Mike has hired additional members to the RNG team who comes with significant RNG experience. The team is fully engaged, pursuing incremental opportunities and putting the final touches on the business plan. We'll share more details on that in the coming months. 09:28 Turning to our water and wastewater utility businesses. As previously mentioned, in December 2021 we signed our largest acquisition to date to acquire Far West Water and wastewater utilities in Yuma, Arizona, a very fast-growing region which currently serves approximately 25,000 customers. We've met with all the Arizona utility commissioners and look forward to working closely with them in SAP. In March, we submitted the application for approval of the transaction to the Arizona Commission. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year and it to be accretive to earnings per share after its first full year of operations. 10:05 In the first quarter, we also announced additional agreements to acquire two water utilities near our existing systems in Texas. We remain excited about the investment potential for this business and we look forward to more announcements soon. And finally, this morning I'm proud that Northwest Natural Holdings being named one of 2022's World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. This reflects our longstanding commitment to leadership and business integrity through best-in-class ethics, compliance and governance practices. It is the first year Northwest Natural Holdings has been recognized and is one of only nine honorees in the energy and utilities industry. In all, 136 honorees were recognized spanning 22 countries and 45 industries. I view good governance is the backbone of a strong company and we'll continue to focus on this going forward. 10:57 In conclusion, your company is financially strong, complete and I'm very pleased with the opportunities we have across all businesses. So with that, thank you for joining us this morning. And Alex, we'll open it up for questions if anybody has them.\\nOperator: 11:13 Thank you.  Our first question for today comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America.\\nDavid Anderson: 11:32 Good morning.\\nKody Clark: Hey, good morning, David and Frank. This is Kody Clark on for Julien. Thanks for the time. So first, curious if you can share more on what you're seeing with the current inflationary backdrop? And specifically, how much is expected as it relates to the IT program for '22 versus some other pressures that we've seen with the backdrop?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 11:57 Hello, good morning, Kody, it's Frank. Yes, I wouldn't -- I don't want to describe the O&M change that you're seeing as inflationary. It's really an effort that we're making right now. A lot of that impact is coming from some investments that we're having to make in IT. And part of that is taking on some cloud arrangements which flows through O&M now. That's a fair piece of that. The rest of it is salary and benefits are up. I wouldn't call that inflationary. We didn't see a huge, say, extraordinary change in our salary and benefits year-over-year. And then we also have a little bit more business development. We're doing RNG now, it's in a competitive market as well as the water business. 12:39 So, you kind of have those three things and then just your ordinary -- the business is growing. This is why we filed the rate case or a big part of it year-over-year. Just we knew this growth was coming. I will say though that the first quarter shows a bigger change, if you looked at a percentage, probably almost double what we would expect for the full year. So we expect O&M to grow this year. Nothing unusual there. But in the first quarter, there's a little bit of a timing impact that makes the first quarter versus the first quarter last year look a bit higher. So that will normalize as the year plays out.\\nKody Clark: 13:13 Understood. Got it. And on regulated RNG, you're at 3% of volumes. But as we think about the caps in '25 and beyond, how should we be thinking about your ability to rebate investments versus just offtake? So what's the difference in customer costs, if any? And any data points or color there that you can point to would be helpful.\\nDavid Anderson: 13:37 Yes. Kody, I think the number one thing that you -- that everybody should understand is, we're going to do all we can to decarbonize as much of our product as we can under Senate Bill 98 and that will be through -- it could be through investments or it could be through just direct purchases, whatever is in the best interest of our customers. And right now, we've done that and we've done it through a rate base investment with the Tyson opportunity that I referenced in my prepared remarks and then we've also got purchase agreements. 14:04 So I expect more coming down as we continue to progress and hopefully, it reaches close to the limit of Senate Bill 98 as quickly as we possibly can. So it's a little hard right now to say X amount will come from rate base, X amount will come from purchases. Again, we'll do what is in the best interest of our customers, which I believe going forward will be a combination of both.\\nKody Clark: 14:29 Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze it in on competitive RNG. And you mentioned potentially getting some additional announcements here. But wondering if there's any timing that you can point to? Is it a matter of getting those first projects under your belt and in service in early 2023 before committing to anything incremental or could we see some additional announcements sooner?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 14:55 Yes. We're in the early stages, as we just mentioned. I'm really pleased with the progress that Mike has made with his team of getting the team established. There's already incremental opportunities that we're looking at and it's one of the reasons when we came out with the strategy late last year that we raised our earnings growth guidance from the 3% to 5% through 4% to 6% because we do see additional opportunities here that will help the company grow faster than it would without that. 15:21 So more details to come in the coming months but you're right, Kody, I think we need to do some more transactions and then we'll be a little bit more descriptive when those transactions happen. And some of those can be development, some of them could be contract purchases and we market them, there's various options that Mike is working through with the team right now.\\nKody Clark: 15:41 Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks so much for the time, and good luck.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 15:45 You bet. Thank you.\\nOperator: 15:49 Thank you.  Our next question for today comes from Selman Akyol from Stifel. Your line is now open.\\nSelman Akyol: 16:02 Thank you. Good morning. Just staying with renewables. Was there any update on hydrogen? I mean, we're just starting to hear more about it. So I was just curious from what you're seeing on your side.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 16:12 Nothing new update on our front. Nikki, why don't you kind of give an indication of what we're working on?\\nNikki Sparley: 16:18 Sure. We have a couple of efforts that are active right now. One of them is continuation of our work with the Eugene Electric Utility to develop a hydrogen blending project in Eugene, where we're at there is we have an engineer and an equipment consultants working on finishing the project plan. We also hired a consultant to do a system audit. It's a readiness audit in that site and where we're going to be blending in that area that helps us understand hydrogen readiness for all our pipes and components and meters. 16:55 And we expect that work to be done in July and then we'll be wrapping on that into a potential filing under Senate Bill 98 here in Oregon, along with securing potentially other funding from a clean energy fund in the United States. The other thing that we're doing is continuing our hydrogen blend cap at our Sherwood facility in Oregon. We've been blending about 5% hydrogen in a section of that facility for about 1.5 years, testing end-use applications, furnaces, water heaters, fireplaces. 17:35 Our 2022 goals are to step up that blend to a 24/7 operation with a ramp-up at a 15% blend and 5% increment through this year, of course, subject to performance, both in our system and on the end-use equipment. And we're looking at other opportunities with hydrogen in our area and nationally partnering with other groups. The application that I mentioned for the Eugene project with the -- under that Senate Bill 98, that is legislation that was passed several years ago in Oregon that allows natural gas utilities to apply for spending on projects that reduce emissions that would otherwise not be cost-effective. 18:24 So it's an avenue that we have to work collectively with the EWEB Electric Utility. And I'm sorry, it's SD844, I said 98, I apologize, that's our RNG legislation. But a lot of activity and you're right, we're hearing a lot of interest in hydrogen and we're working hard on it ourselves.\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 18:47 Yes, Selman, I mean, we're really focused on RNG and hydrogen. They're both going to be the solutions for the industry and I would argue for the greater economy as a whole. So hopefully, more to come on that front but we're all in on both.\\nSelman Akyol: 19:02 Got it and very helpful. Just pivoting over to water. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there and maybe your pipeline and just how pricing is going or is there upward pressure on the systems that you're seeing in terms of pricing or is it sort of in line with what you've been doing?\\nFrank Burkhartsmeyer: 19:21 Yes. I'm really pleased with the success we've had today in the last year or so. Justin, why don't you -- Justin is our President of the Water Company and let me get him to address it.\\nJustin Palfreyman: 19:31 Yeah. Good morning, Salman. We continue to see a robust set of opportunities in pipeline in the water space. It is competitive and there are a number of players out there that are also pursuing opportunities. That competition varies a little bit depending on the specific market. But we are pleased with the progress we've been making and we see a fairly robust pipeline of opportunities going forward. We will continue to tuck-in smaller acquisitions around our existing service territories and we're working hard on investing in the existing utilities that we own. We actually just completed a couple of rate cases this last quarter with new rates in effect May 1 in both -- one of our Oregon subsidiaries and one of our Washington subsidiaries. 20:20 So things are going well there. I believe that we'll continue to see a robust set of opportunities and acquisitions going forward.\\nSelman Akyol: 20:29 All right, thank you very much.\\nDavid Anderson: 20:32 Thank you, Salman.\\nOperator: 20:35 Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So I will hand back to David Anderson for any closing remarks.\\nDavid Anderson: 20:43 Thank you, Alex. And thank you guys for joining us and for those of you that will be at the AGA event here in a couple of weeks, we'd love to see you, give Nikki a call and we'll see if we can set up time. With that, have a great day, everybody. Thank you.\\nOperator: 20:59 Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. 00:21 I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Ms. Ann Thornton. Ma'am, you may begin.\\nAnn Thornton: 00:25 Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Brady Corporation fiscal twenty twenty two first quarter earnings conference call. The slides for this morning's call are located on our website at www.bradycorp.com/investors. 00:38 We will begin our prepared remarks on slide number three. Please note that during this call we may make comments about forward-looking information. Words such as expect, will, may, believe, forecast and anticipate are just a few examples of words identifying a forward-looking statement. 00:53 It's important to note that forward-looking information is subject to various risk factors and uncertainties which could significantly impact expected results. Risk factors were noted in our news release this morning and in Brady's fiscal twenty twenty one Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC in September. 01:11 Also, please note that this teleconference is copyrighted by Brady Corporation and may not be rebroadcast without the consent of Brady. We will be recording this call and broadcasting it on the Internet. As such, your participation in the Q&A session will constitute your consent to being recorded. 01:25 I'll now turn the call over to Brady's President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Nauman. Michael?\\nMichael Nauman: 01:31 Thank you, Ann. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we released our fiscal twenty twenty two first quarter financial results, which showed strong sales growth and profitability. Even in this challenging environment caused by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 virus and the associated inflation and logistical challenges, the Brady team once again performed quite well. I'm proud of how the team was able to navigate this challenging economic environment and deliver for both our customers and our shareholders. 02:08 This quarter, we grew sales by a very healthy sixteen percent and we increased earnings per share by four point seven percent. If you exclude the impact of amortization, then our EPS was up even more significantly at nine point one percent. In addition to this solid revenue and earnings growth, we have a rock solid balance sheet. This quarter we returned more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, and we are still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 02:41 In our WPS business, sales were down by seven point eight percent. This sales reduction was almost exclusively the result of very challenging comparables. Last year, our WPS team did an excellent job of providing COVID-related products to our customers. The sale of these products, which included social distance signage and personal protective equipment has since waned, thus resulting in challenging comparables. The best way to look at our WPS business is to compare sales to the pre-COVID period of fiscal twenty twenty, which would show that our current sales levels exceeded those historic pre-COVID levels. 03:24 In our Identification Solutions business, we continue to post excellent results, with sales growth of twenty five point four percent and segment profit growth of twenty one point two percent. And if you exclude the impact of amortization expense, segment profit would have been up a robust twenty six point four percent. Our Identification Solutions business is a very strong franchise and continues to perform extremely well. As we look ahead, our priorities are the first to drive organic sales growth and ensure we are serving our customers extremely well during this period of challenging logistics. Second, it is to take the necessary cost and pricing actions to offset the impacts of this inflationary environment and return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels. Third, is to integrate our recent acquisitions. And finally, to deploy our capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 04:28 In our ID Solutions business, we're embracing these priorities by increasing our investments in R&D, including the incremental R&D necessary to fully realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions. We are certainly seeing benefits from our historical R&D focus as we're launching new products at an increasing rate and we're continuing to distance ourselves from our competitors, who neither have the scale nor financial wherewithal to invest as heavily in R&D. 04:57 We're also improving our online presence by upgrading our websites and investing more in digital marketing talent all while expanding our sales force and expanding geographically into underserved markets. We're driving significant automation enhancements within our factories and distribution centers, which in a period marked by scarcity of labor and rising costs, this continuous push to drive automation is critical. 05:24 Our strong new product line-up, investments to drive sales and our positive momentum in driving efficiencies give us confidence that our ID Solutions business will continue to generate strong organic sales growth with very healthy margins in fiscal twenty twenty two and beyond. 05:43 In our Workplace Safety business, we are capitalizing on our common web platform by using our much stronger market intelligence to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We've increased our investments to new product development and the pace of new product launches in an effort to increase the percentage of proprietary high value products sold to our customers, which will have a positive impact on our profit margins. 06:08 And we're intensely increasing our advertising spend and our headcount in certain businesses that have lagged in an effort to drive future revenues. These investments resulted in reduced segment profit this quarter, but will result in increased revenues as we progressed throughout the fiscal year. 06:27 Our Workplace Safety business is headed in the right direction. And I'm confident that the changes we've been implementing and the investments we've been making will help drive long-term sales and profit growth. While we're investing in organic sales, we're also working to streamline our SG&A cost structure, so that we can fund our sales growth initiatives while still driving down SG&A expense and we're focused on becoming a more efficient manufacturer by automating wherever we can. 06:57 In addition to our focus on driving organic sales growth and becoming a more efficient organization, we are also actively integrating the three acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter last year, which includes building out our industrial track and trace solution set. Much of the increased R&D that you see relates to the investments necessary to build out a comprehensive solution that will help move us into faster growing end markets and accelerate sales growth for years to come. 07:25 I'm confident we'll continue to see revenue growth in future quarters. However, we're seeing inflationary pressures across many different cost categories, from wages to freight to raw materials and we've had challenges securing supply of certain products, including chips and selected products for our supply chain originates in Asia. 07:47 In general, we've been overcoming these shortages, but it has resulted in increased freight charges as we've used air freight more than we have in the past. Even with these inflationary pressures, our gross profit margin was still an enviable forty eight point two percent, which was right in line with the forty eight point two percent experience in the fourth quarter of last year. But our cost increases have neither been large enough nor fast enough to fully keep up with rising costs, resulting in our gross margins being down around seventy basis points and year-over-year basis. 08:27 As such, we're putting through additional price increases across many of our product lines to try to catch up with the rapidly increasing costs. We believe that these gross margin challenges are temporary and that in the near term, we will return to our historical gross margin levels of close to fifty percent. Even with this challenging logistical environment, Brady is well-positioned as we look to the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. I'm confident in our ability to deliver results to our customers, our employees, and of course, our shareholders. 09:01 I'll now turn the call over to Aaron to give a little more detail on our financial results. Then I'll return to provide specific commentary about our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses. Aaron?\\nAaron James Pearce: 09:14 Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll start the financial review on slide number three. Sales in the first quarter were three hundred and twenty one point five million dollars, which was an increase of sixteen percent when compared to the same quarter last year and GAAP pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent to forty four point seven million dollars. 09:37 Impacting earnings this quarter was a significant increase in amortization expense from the acquisitions completed at the end of last year. If you exclude amortization expense from all periods presented, and our pre-tax earnings would have increased by eleven point three percent to forty eight point five million dollars. 09:57 GAAP diluted EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars, which was an increase of four point seven percent over last year's first quarter. And if you exclude amortization expense, then EPS would have increased by nine point one percent to zero point seventy two dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty six dollars in the first quarter of last year. So, financially, Q1 was another strong quarter even with the logistical challenges and the inflationary pressures that Michael just mentioned. 10:27 Moving to slide number four, you will find our quarterly sales trends. Our sixteen percent sales increase consisted of organic sales growth of seven percent, an increase from acquisitions of eight point three percent, and an increase from foreign currency translation of zero point seven percent. 10:44 Organic sales growth in our ID Solutions business was a robust thirteen point two percent in Q1. Our Workplace Safety business benefited from strong COVID-related product sales in last year's first quarter thus creating tough comparables. As a result of these tough comparables, we saw a decline in WPS organic sales of eight point six percent this quarter. 11:07 If we compare our sales levels to the pre-pandemic period, which for us would be the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty, you'll see that our total sales are up a full twelve percent over pre-pandemic levels. And if you compare sales by division, you'll see that Identification Solutions is fifteen point six percent above pre-pandemic levels and Workplace Safety is one point two percent above pre-pandemic levels. 11:35 This strong performance not only against last year, but also against the pre-pandemic period is a direct result of the investments that we've been making and the strong sales momentum that we developed just before the pandemic hit. 11:47 Turning to slide number five, you'll see our gross profit margin trending. Our gross profit margin was forty eight point two percent this quarter compared to forty eight point nine percent in the first quarter of last year. As Michael mentioned, we're seeing inflationary pressures and we're finding it difficult to fill open manufacturing roles. But we're automating wherever we can, we're driving efficiencies at a strong pace and we're putting it through targeted price increases. 12:14 On slide number six, you will find our SG&A expense trending. SG&A was ninety six point seven million dollars this quarter compared to eighty three million dollars in the first quarter of last year. SG&A was heavily impacted by a full quarter of expense from the three acquisitions completed near the end of last year along with the increase in amortization expense that I just mentioned. 12:36 Amortization expense was one point four million dollars in the first quarter of last year and was three point eight million dollars in the first quarter of this year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was thirty point one percent this quarter compared to thirty point zero percent in the first quarter of last year. So, effectively, right in line with the prior year. However, if you exclude amortization expense from both the current year and the prior year, then SG&A would have declined from twenty nine point five percent of sales last year to twenty eight point nine percent of sales this year. 13:11 Slide number seven is the trending of our investments in research and development. This quarter, we invested thirteen point nine million dollars in R&D. We're committed to increasing our R&D investments as we continue to see opportunities for incremental R&D within our core business and specifically in building out a comprehensive industrial track and trace platform that encompasses our printers, high quality materials, RFID scanners, and barcode scanners. These investments in R&D are critical to help propel Brady's long-term sales growth and protect our gross profit margins. 13:45 Slide number eight illustrates our pre-tax income trends. Pre-tax earnings increased five point eight percent on a GAAP basis and increased eleven point three percent, if you exclude amortization expense from all periods. 13:59 Slide number nine illustrates our after-tax income and EPS trends. As I mentioned, our GAAP EPS was zero point sixty seven dollars this quarter compared to zero point sixty four dollars in last year's first quarter, an increase of four point seven percent. And if you exclude the after-tax impact of amortization, our EPS would have increased by an even stronger nine point one percent. 14:21 On slide number ten, you'll find a summary of our cash generation. We generated twenty seven point five million dollars of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow was sixteen point two million dollars this quarter. Our underlying cash flow was strong, but we intentionally invested in both inventories as well as capital expenditures. This quarter, we purchased two previously leased manufacturing facilities for a total cash outlay of seven point six million dollars. 14:50 Both of these facility purchases were ROI positive and will help secure our long-term future. This quarter, we also continued to increase inventories as we've been intentionally prioritizing customer service and product availability over trying to optimize inventory levels and risk running out of critical materials. Over the last six months, we've increased our inventories by approximately thirty million dollars. 15:16 Now if you'll turn to slide eleven, you can see the impact that Brady's historically strong cash generation has had on our balance sheet. Even after returning more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, having heightened CapEx and intentionally increasing inventory levels, on October thirty one, we were still in a net cash position of more than ninety million dollars. 15:40 Our strong balance sheet puts us in a fantastic position to execute additional value-enhancing activities, including investing in R&D, completing additional acquisitions, and returning funds to our shareholders. Our approach to capital allocation has not changed and has been serving us well. 15:59 First, we use our cash to fully fund organic sales and efficiency opportunities throughout the economic cycle. This includes investing in new product development, sales generating resources, IT improvements, capability enhancing capital expenditures and CapEx to further automate our facilities. We will also -- we will absolutely keep funding these investments where it makes sense and where the investments are ROI positive. 16:27 And second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We've now increased our annual dividend for thirty six consecutive years, which puts us in a pretty elite group of companies. 16:41 After fully funding organic investments and dividends, we then deploy our cash in a disciplined manner for either acquisitions where we believe that we have strong synergistic opportunities or for buybacks when we see a disconnect in our view of intrinsic value versus Brady's trade-in price. 17:00 Slide number twelve summarizes our guidance for the year ending July thirty one, twenty twenty two. Our full year diluted earnings per share guidance, excluding amortization, remains unchanged at a range of three point twelve dollars to three point thirty two dollars per share. On a GAAP basis, our full year diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged at a range of two point ninety dollars to three point ten dollars per share. 17:25 Included in our GAAP earnings per share guidance is an increase in after-tax amortization expense of approximately six million dollars. After-tax amortization increases from about five point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty one to about eleven point five million dollars in fiscal twenty twenty two, which is a delta of about zero point twelve dollars per share. 17:46 As we look at stagging throughout the rest of this fiscal year, we anticipate our short term gross profit margin challenges to persist throughout our fiscal second quarter and history shows that our second quarter is seasonally our lowest quarter of the year and generally has earnings per share below that of Q1. 18:05 As we move beyond the second quarter, we expect to see increased benefits from our pricing actions as well as the increased benefits from our many efficiency and automation projects. As a result, we continue to expect that the majority of our earnings per share growth will come in the third and fourth quarters of this year. 18:23 We also expect total sales growth to exceed twelve percent for the full year ending July thirty one, twenty twenty two which is inclusive of both organic sales growth as well as sales growth from the recently completed acquisitions. 18:39 We will continue to make the investments necessary to drive organic sales growth. We will continue to search for acquisitions that advance our strategies and we will continue to drive sustainable efficiency gains, while being tight on non-revenue generating expenses. 18:54 As for capital allocation, we'll keep investing in our organic business, we will keep investing in our industrial track and trace initiatives, we will continue to return funds to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks. We did just buyback eighteen point nine million dollars worth of shares last quarter and we'll continue to look for acquisitions where the price is right and the strategic fit is clear. 19:18 We have a strong balance sheet and we use it as a tool to drive long term shareholder value. Potential risks to this guidance, among others, include the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other major currencies such as the euro or the British pound, worsening logistics that don't allow us to meet our commitments to our customers and further inflationary pressures that we cannot offset in a timely enough manner. 19:42 I'll now turn the call back to Michael to cover our divisional results and to provide some closing comments before the Q&A session. Michael?\\nMichael Nauman: 19:52 Thank you, Aaron. Slide number thirteen outlines the first quarter financial results for our Identification Solutions business. IDS sales increased twenty five point four percent to two hundred and forty eight point six million dollars. This very robust sales growth is comprised of organic growth of thirteen point two percent, acquisition growth of eleven point six percent and an increase of zero point six percent from foreign currency translation. 20:20 Organic sales in our IDS division were once again very strong, not only versus the first quarter of last year, but also against previous sequential quarters. And on the cost side, our strong focus on sustainable efficiency gains partially offset the input cost increases that we've been experiencing. 20:39 Segment profit as a percentage of sales was nineteen point six percent, which was down from twenty point three percent last year. However, if you exclude the sizable increase in amortization that Aaron mentioned, then segment profit as a percentage of sales would have increased from twenty one percent of sales to twenty one point one percent of sales, so an increase of about ten basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. 21:07 Regionally, organic sales in Asia were strong this quarter with growth of over fifteen percent compared to the first quarter of last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of Asian organic sales growth in excess of 10%. Organic sales were also up more than fifteen percent in EMEA, despite several lockdowns continuing throughout most of the first quarter. Our European team once again did an excellent job driving sales growth while handling the period interruptions caused by the lockdowns. 21:39 We also had organic sales growth of nearly twelve percent in the Americas. We saw growth in all product lines and geographies throughout the quarter and we were especially pleased with the bounce back in our healthcare product line where organic sales growth increased approximately eleven percent. In general, the sales trends and ideas are very positive. 22:03 Our commitment to R&D remains a high priority. We've ratcheted up our investments to build a complete industrial track and trace solution. And although, we are probably a full two years away from having a complete track and trace solution, we've already been experiencing very nice synergies from our recent acquisitions and we expect these sales synergies to only increase from here on out due to the complementary nature of our product portfolios and the more complete product offerings that Code, Magicard and Nordic ID bring to Brady. 22:36 These acquisitions are performing slightly better than expected and bring us valuable technologies that help us round out our product offerings and make Brady more valuable to our customers. Clearly, we're devoting a significant amount of time and money to our track and trace product offerings, but we are not sacrificing R&D investments in other areas such as printers and materials. 23:00 We continued our steady stream of new printer introductions by launching the J4300 Brady Jet Label Printer. This inkjet printer combines with Brady’s high efficiency proprietary materials to balance the safety and complexity of compliance labels with the demands of industrial environments. 23:21 Our industrial inkjet printers save our customers time by quickly and easily creating compliant, long lasting photo quality labels, signs and tags that are needed to create a safer, more efficient workplace. It's a combination of our steady stream of best-in-class printers plus Brady's high-performance materials that sets Brady apart from our competition. 23:45 From Barcodes to extremely small text to perfect photo quality images, our customers' most important information needs to be visible and needs to stay put in any type of environment. Simply stated, Brady's printers and materials are all about high-performance in the harshest of environments. 24:06 Our R&D pipeline is strong and we continue to launch innovative new solutions that help our customers solve problems and be more efficient and effective. I'm excited about what we're doing in an ID Solutions business and how our acquisitions of Code, Nordic ID, and Magicard will further accelerate our growth. 24:27 We're improving our customer service, investing in our future, and streamlining the rest of our cost structure. These positive revenue trends combined with our strong cost discipline will help offset inflationary pressures and paint a bright future for our IDS division. 24:47 Moving to slide number fourteen, you will find a summary of Workplace Safety financial performance. WPS sales decline seven point eight percent, which consisted of an organic sales decline of eight point six percent and an increase from foreign currency of zero point eight percent. This sales decline was primarily driven by challenging comparables to last year's first quarter. 25:11 Our WPS business performed extremely well and supplied our customers with a great deal of COVID-19 related products during the pandemic last year and the demand for these types of products has declined substantially since then. Our WPS sales were seventy two point nine million dollars this quarter, which were above the pre-pandemic sales experienced in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty. 25:38 Even in these challenging times with periodic shutdowns, our European WPS team did an outstanding job of increasing its customer base. And for those customers who initially came to us to purchase COVID-related products, our team has done a nice job providing these same customers with our core safety and identification products as well. 25:59 Our Australian business performed similarly to our European business. During the pandemic, our Australian business grew organic sales over ten percent in last year's first quarter. Looking back, the challenging comparables we were pleased with this quarter's sales volumes as they were above pre-pandemic levels. 26:21 Over the last several quarters, we've increased our Australian customer base and we continue to find opportunities to enhance our digital marketing approach to ensure that we retain our new customers and turn them into long-term repeat customers. The sale of COVID-related products declined in North America as well this quarter and this decline was not fully offset by our non-COVID product offerings, thus leading to a decline in organic sales in the Americas. 26:46 And as I alluded to earlier, we've made investments to improve certain of our lagging businesses in WPS, including our business in the U.S. that primarily serves micro businesses. We've incurred start-up costs to open a new facility in the U.S. We've invested in head count, and we're also investing in additional advertising. All in, these incremental investments were approximately two point five million dollars. 27:12 These investments negatively impacted WPS' profitability this quarter, but we believe that these investments are critical to return our WPS business to sustainable long-term profitable growth. In addition to these investments, our WPS business also experienced gross margin compression as a result of raw materials, freight and wage inflation as I mentioned. 27:36 Similar to our IDS business, we're taking actions to offset these cost increases. WPS' segment profit was two point three million dollars this quarter compared to eight million dollars in last year's first quarter. This reduction in segment profit was directly related to the reduced sales volumes, the incremental investments that I just mentioned, as well as significant cost pressures. 27:58 Our WPS team members are listening to their customers to identify what they need. They are modifying their marketing campaigns to reach entirely new customers and entirely new industries and they are working hard to address underperforming businesses within the portfolio. 28:16 Our Workplace Safety business has one more quarter of moderately difficult comparables ahead of it, but we are laying the foundation for a solid recovery. I'm proud of the role that Brady played and continues to play in this long ever-changing fight against COVID-19. 28:34 Our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety products help companies with social distancing, our products help schools reopen safely, and safety and identification products were used by our front-line workers all around the globe. 28:50 And now our products are helping our customers increase efficiency to help them meet their own set of customer demand. This pandemic is not over and the financial impacts stemming from the pandemic are certainly not over. Throughout the pandemic, we invested in growth and efficiencies and its continued level of investment that will enable us to keep this strong positive momentum. 29:15 Brady is in an enviable financial position. We're coming off of record EPS here. Our earnings are up and our balance sheet is very strong. We're in a net cash position even after making three acquisitions toward the end of last year and returning more than thirty million dollars to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends this quarter. 29:36 We will continue to invest in R&D, sales generating resources, and capacity enhancing CapEx, all while being very tight on non-revenue generating expenses and aggressively working through global logistical issues and inflationary forces. 29:55 I'm very proud of how our team performed throughout this challenging period. Their ability to deal with uncertainty, think on their feet, and solve problems quickly all while never compromising the long-term has built a solid foundation for Brady's future. 30:11 With that, I'd like to now start the Q&A. Operator, would you please provide instructions to our listeners?\\nOperator: 30:20 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael McGinn at Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nMichael McGinn: 30:37 Hey. Good morning, everybody.\\nMichael Nauman: 30:38 Good morning, Michael.\\nMichael McGinn: 30:42 I wanted to go -- talk about Workplace Safety for a second. So, you mentioned sales are kind of in line with those pre-COVID levels and I'm wondering, if holding the line on the Workplace Safety business those sales, is the goal versus Identification Solutions, if you strip out the acquisitions, it's materially above pre-COVID levels, is Workplace Safety core to shareholder value?\\nMichael Nauman: 31:12 Great question, Michael. We are working hard to really change the profile of WPS in a significant and meaningful way. We are investing significantly in R&D, we're investing in in-sourcing key products, we're investing in getting closer to our customers. We believe that we have a value-add equation there that is unique in the marketplace as we execute these changes. It is going to take time. We are already down that path. We're excited about what we see from that. But this is not a quick situation and they have also been plagued more significantly than IDS, in that, A, a much larger percentage of their products are brought in, and B, a much larger percentage of their products come from Asia. So, they have a both logistical and cost pressures there. So, we absolutely see more short-term difficulties in that business, but we do believe that it is a business that overall, we can continue to provide significant shareholder value over the long term. That said, I want to be clear on all of our businesses, we evaluate our portfolio. We have in the past looked at some businesses that didn't make sense putting into our portfolio. We will continue to do that. We are very strongly cognizant of our critical need to make sure that we're always providing our shareholders with the most significant return for their investment.\\nMichael McGinn: 32:48 Great. And then switching gears to the gross margin conversation and the chips, you mentioned being able to kind of maybe hold the line up fifty percent gross margin last quarter, not a whole lot of noise from chips and you mentioned being proactive. What change quarter-to-quarter and does this current situation alleviate or does it push you to make more of an eighty, twenty portfolio pruning approach to you need to sunset some legacy products here to kind of make way for the newer product suites?\\nMichael Nauman: 33:22 It's excellent. Things are changing rapidly. I'm sure you're hearing that across the board. We have very good connections throughout all industrial business space and we know that what we're dealing with is certainly not unique. But the challenges of logistics, as I mentioned last quarter, I believe hopefully I did, I'd have to go back and listen to the tape. We do think will last for eighteen to twenty four months, that is not a guarantee of timing, but it is our latest belief and our continued latest belief on how this will impact things. 34:01 What that means is product sets, even in IDS that are more dependent, we have those on Asian imported products are dealing with much larger sourcing difficulties and also timing difficulties. We have made a lot of proactive steps. I know for a fact that in many ways we're able to service our customers better than our competition today and it is our goal to continue to do that. 34:29 But as far as pruning products, we look at that regularly. Throughout my tenure at Brady, we've pruned a number of products and continue to look at that cycle, and make sure we're offering our customers the best and the brightest. As an example, with our printers years ago when I first got here, we would allow the products to really just run to life before developing new ones. 34:52 We have an extremely strong pipeline, roadmap, and we make sure that we are always upgrading our products on a reliable basis. So, we never experienced that. So, we've created a very natural pruning process with all of our products that really look at life cycle capabilities. So, for instance, things like software upgraded, much more rapidly firmware and then hardware and we have a cadence depending on the product sets and the markets to do that. 35:25 But to be unequivocal, yes, we are taking this opportunity to look at all of our products to make sure that it's a product that still makes sense in the long-term marketplace. As you come out of a downturn like a pandemic or any other downturn or you look at our workplace changes that have come out of this, you have to be cognizant of the fact that our customers do have changing needs. And we believe a lot of our products are becoming more digital, more focused on interconnectivity re system approach, and therefore that does lead to pruning in the other direction as well.\\nMichael McGinn: 36:00 Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 36:02 Thank you, sir.\\nOperator: 36:04 Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Ferazani of Sidoti. Your line is open.\\nSteve Ferazani: 36:12 Good morning, everyone. I did want to follow up on a question about Workplace Safety. You mentioned the two point five million dollars of investments in the quarter. But, those sound like more like expected ongoing costs every quarter. So, it sounds like to get your margins back to pre-COVID levels, you're going to have to get revenue up substantially?\\nMichael Nauman: 36:38 Steve, those are actually one-time costs. Those are absolutely one-time costs. We are careful and as you know, through our history and your knowledge of our history, we are very careful not to bucketize costs that are not one-time is one-time. In this case, the majority of those expenses, the vast majority were related to opening up a new facility that is already proving itself logistically to be tremendous help in us re-growing that business. In particular, as you know, micro businesses in the U.S. were dramatically disproportionately impacted, but we're already seeing the green shoots that I spoke about six, nine months ago that we would see. We're already seeing them from new start-ups. 37:28 The good news about having a lot of cash right now in society is that the entrepreneurial spirit in the U.S. is alive and well and we will definitely see new businesses starting up that benefit from our product sets and we've repositioned that business to be located in an area that is very advantageous to be much more successful even than we were in the past before the pandemic. So, no, those are definitely one-time costs.\\nSteve Ferazani: 37:56 Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for clarifying. In terms of clearly logistics problems will hurt, obviously, going through the 3Q conference calls we've heard this across the board that they are clearly worse than they were three months ago. You're maintaining guidance. I'm just trying to figure out, are you figuring out more work arounds, are you just getting a sense that maybe it sounds like you don't see an end to it. So, I'm just trying to figure out why maintain guidance if logistics problems are getting at least worse in the near term?\\nMichael Nauman: 38:28 Well, just to speak more specifically about logistics, they vary by business, by percentage of imported products, by location. So, let me give you an example. In Australia, everything -- not everything, but we certainly import from Europe, the U.S., and Asia significantly larger amount of products than we do from other locations. Their logistics, their shipping costs, things like that are up incredibly. Even cross-country in Australia, the shipping costs are up large amounts. 39:03 Historically, as I've told you in the past, I believe last quarter, I can count on two percent is the shipping cost number throughout -- most of my history in international businesses and it is way up depending on the business above that. So, those are not going to go away. We definitely see those continuing to be impacted. Obviously, fuel rates things like that will change things, but we are anticipating that our cost remain up for an extensive period of time. 39:33 In addition, suppliers are having lots of different pressures from labor inflation to core material cost inflation that they are in some cases passing on more or less aggressively and we are certainly very aggressive about making sure we have a cost effective and significantly positive supply base, but we don't see that going away. 40:02 And so where we're pushing is on things like automation we're excelling. I think that you are aware we just introduced and literally are just almost fully completely functional on our inventory storage system in our major North American distribution center. This is both a way to rapidly increase our ability to be productive, but also to significantly reduce our costs. 40:34 We're able to get products out to our customers quicker and a higher quality rate because of this, but also less dependent on labor that is difficult to find and the costs are increasing. So, our automation efforts from that to our machinery equipment, they are all really -- many of them are coming to fruition that we were working on before the pandemic started. So, I believe we're ahead of lot of our competition, but we continue to invest in that area as well. 41:01 And then the last lever that is very significant is, we look at the value of our products to our customers, the costs that we face and we go to them, understanding that they are facing challenges as well and make sure that our prices are aligned with what the value we provide is and are increasing those across the board, but relative each product set. 41:27 We are not a peanut butter type of company, we're not a peanut butter approach, we're looking at all the value statements we provide and driving our prices based on that. So those levers we are working on very hard. Our teams are very resourceful. Without getting into specifics, I literally heard a brilliant idea yesterday that will provide great product for our customer at the same price, but greatly reduce our cost structure on it. 41:54 So we've got a lot going on in that area. So, we are confident that although, we've told you the second quarter is still going to be a challenge, that the third and fourth quarters we see a definite road map to our future as we projected.\\nSteve Ferazani: 42:10 Great. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 42:13 Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.\\nOperator: 42:15 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\\nKeith Housum: 42:24 Good morning, guys. Michael, just kind of elaborating on the previous conversation here, does it sound like this quarter or perhaps the second quarter will be like a low point of your cost of -- your margin pressures and you perhaps have a little visibility or line of visibility into it creeping back up?\\nMichael Nauman: 42:44 Yeah, Keith. I think our biggest opportunity set is in regard to revenue. I really feel very good about our ability to continue to drive our revenue. I don't have a perfect crystal ball. I know I've used that analogy with you in years' past. I don't have a perfect crystal ball, but what I do know is that we're pulling all the right levers to accomplish that goal. 43:10 I'm not going to give you a perfect prognosis of, hey, our margins are going to be X, Y, and Z by the third or fourth quarter. But I think in combination with revenue increases and really improving pricing and improving our cost structure and our logistics structure, I do feel confident that we'll be able to continue down the path that we're on for the guidance we've given.\\nKeith Housum: 43:38 Okay. And you referenced some challenges getting some products in the door as well, some challenges hiring the right amount people. Is there a sense that you lost out on some revenue during the quarter because of those challenges or do you got it done just costing more to get it done?\\nMichael Nauman: 43:53 Yes and yes. It's definitely cost a lot more. Without giving specific products, we've been air shipping products we never shipped before. I can also tell you, some of those products are now on ships in addition to air shipping. So, we are -- there were some key products we absolutely needed to get to our customers. 44:15 Our first goal is to get them to our customers even though the cost may not be what we want, but we want to get them to our customers. And so, we did do that with a lot of air shipping. We currently do have some of those key products on ships again, thank goodness, but what that means is, we were able to get ahead of the curve and produce enough extra that we could still keep shipping by air, but put a bunch on ships. So, that is absolutely true in that regard. We definitely moved the first and foremost. 44:50 Now, did we ship everything we wanted to ship? No, we didn't. But I will tell you, I was personally amazed at the Herculean effort at some of our factories to close out October, Amazed. It was a tremendous effort and it made me literally just proud of all our people of how hard they work, how driven they were. 45:15 We've got a very motivated team and they have a lot of pride. They have a lot of pride in getting to our customers what they need and they don't want to let them down. And so, although we did leave some material on the shelf and some material in the system, we really closed the gap in a very significant way.\\nKeith Housum: 45:37 Okay. And then the final question from me, you referenced price increases going into effect. Can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the end markets which just price increases you will be going toward and you guys raise your prices on a regular cycle, so just want to confirm is this off-cycle in IDS, WPS, and Crafts, any color on the amount that you're being forced to raise prices?\\nMichael Nauman: 46:01 Well, first of all, I don't say across the board because we don't peanut butter spread, but the truth is, there is some level of price increase across the board. It just isn't -- we're not putting in place X, Y, Z percent across the board and the timing does vary, Keith. We have contracts, we have agreements, we need to interact with our customers. We treat our customers with a lot of respect. We care about them tremendously. But at the same time, to your point, we have to pass on the value that we create in price increases to them as we're dealing with those pressures. 46:37 Timing, we do have off-cycle increases, we do have on-cycle increases. We are overall raising our prices more than we have in the historical past as our most industrial companies right now. So, overall, I'd say this, yes, off-cycle increases, yes, on-cycle increases and larger increases. But it does absolutely vary by product set and the cost pressures that we're facing in the cost -- product set. 47:06 You also mentioned regions, that's also true on regions. We're raising prices effectively in all regions, but those price increase timing and amounts do vary by region, by customer, by product set. So, yes, this is a significant effort for Brady right now. As I guarantee and I talked to a lot of people, it is for almost all organizations.\\nKeith Housum: 47:34 Yeah. All right. Thanks, Michael. Good luck.\\nMichael Nauman: 47:37 Thank you, sir. Have a great one. Thanks, Keith.\\nOperator: 47:40 Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nMichael McGinn: 47:45 Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. I was wondering, if you had a sense of how lean you think the distribution channel is, how much room there still is to restock and what kind of percentage of your total business that represents?\\nMichael Nauman: 48:00 Well, I apologize, I may not have heard the question perfectly. I'm not sure that was on the slide. But I think what you're asking me, I will say this, we are not seeing significant stock-ups by the distribution channel and that's good news, in that, I do eventually expect an economic boomerang from stocking up, but we are definitely not seeing it right now with our partners, our distributor partners. 48:29 Little harder to tell with our end users, but if you look at society overall and what's happening and I think we probably are seeing some of that. But it's a little harder to tell. But better that I know that it isn't definitely happening right now with our distributor partners. And so therefore, I’m optimistic that volumes will continue to go up in the near future. 48:54 What happens at the end as things untangle from this is yet to be seen. But I would expect, not for us, but for a general economic pullback as there is more inventory and you know this from all the numbers in the system overall than there historically has been.\\nMichael McGinn: 49:18 Great. Then switching gears to the geopolitical front, trade talks have seemingly resumed and we now have an infrastructure framework. Any overall commentary on where you see yourself benefiting in infrastructure and then on the trade, any kind of benchmarks you that the percentage of total imports of your business is?\\nMichael Nauman: 49:45 Well, I'd tell you this, first about we love anything related to infrastructure. We believe we provide products that are critical for the world infrastructure, not just the U.S., but in your particular case, the question. The U.S. is so yes, we do definitely see some very positive construction. We do very well in the construction industry, as a result of the safety needs, identification needs of that industry, their need for high quality, high durability. So, we are excited about that. Obviously, that's going to take some time and the whole construction industry is still tangled up right now. 50:25 So you know, if you're – I’ve been analogy, which is probably myth, but Napoleon lost the war for a lack of a nail, in horseshoe in our horse on a cannon in the Battle of Waterloo. So, that is what I believe the construction industry is facing right now. If you go through a lot of areas in that way buildings are being finished because of literally one or two critical elements. And so, I do think that's going to take a little while to untangle that will impact the rolling out of the infrastructure money, as far as getting to us. But you know what the great news, because we're towards the end of that cycle, typically, the great news is, it will come typically. The great news is it will come. And when it does come that will definitely help Brady. 51:14 Now, let's talk about trade barriers and all of that, we -- it's interesting, everything from automation to developing new products for the next generation to forward to in-sourcing, to forward deploying our products. We've been working on for about five years now, ahead of a lot of companies are just now realizing that's the direction the world is going. By the way, because of the pandemic, so I'm not going to say, I foretold the pandemic, we absolutely did not. No idea. But we were believe -- we believe we were intelligently moving in the direction of the world would have to eventually go. It just happened to be fortuitous. And I don't want to take advantage of a bad situation, but the reality is that we have been positioned proactively for that. 52:02 Why am I saying that because we have forward deployed a lot of resources as close to our customers as possible, as in company – country’s possible. So let me give you an example that's not directly related to trade barriers in the very recent, but the Brexit issue, we have plants and some capabilities all throughout the UK that are really going to and already benefiting from the need to in-source into the UK more products. And that can be said for France and Germany, the Benelux areas, the U.S. China, India, I mean, again and again we are adding resources that we've had in the works in facilities and people to new countries and new regions. 52:48 So, I believe our footprint forward deploying as much as possible to be as reactive, positively reactive to our customers as possible is also going to benefit from this new barrier-oriented mentality. We did it for our customers. We did it for responsiveness. We did it to make sure we always have the products where we need win, but as a result, we fortuitously are going to benefit from this as well.\\nMichael McGinn: 53:18 Understood. Appreciate the time.\\nMichael Nauman: 53:20 Thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.\\nOperator: 53:24 Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Michael Nauman for any closing results -- remarks.\\nMichael Nauman: 53:31 Thank you so much. I'd like to leave you with a few concluding comments this morning. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly entered a new phase. In this phase, we're seeing stress supply chains, increased input costs, labor shortages and overall increased inflation. We're working through this effectively, but we are experiencing some short-term margin compression. 53:56 I don't know what the future holds for the global economy, but I do know that Brady is well positioned to thrive regardless of which direction the economy heads. We have a strong balance sheet. We're prioritizing investments for growth and we have a never-ending focus on cash generation. 54:14 As a result, we're seeing strong sales growth at once our pricing and efficiency initiatives catch up to the cost inflation, our strong sales growth and improved gross profit margins will drive significant bottom-line growth. 54:31 On a final note, I would like to wish a very special Happy Birthday to our own Ann Thornton here at Brady. It is her birthday today. I'm not allowed to say which one, but happy birthday and from all of your friends at Brady, please stay safe. Thank you for your time this morning. Have a great day. Operator, you may disconnect the call.\\nOperator: 54:55 Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\"]]"
