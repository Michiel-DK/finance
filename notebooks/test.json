At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Sean Anthony, VP, Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSean Anthony: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Dun & Bradstreet's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2023. On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. Before we begin, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call, including the Q&A portion of the call, may include forward-looking statements related to the expected future results for our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to are described in our earnings release and other SEC filings. Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information, including reconciliation between non-GAAP financial information to the GAAP financial information, is provided in the press release and supplemental slide presentation. This conference call will be available for replay via webcast through Dun & Bradstreet's Investor Relations website at investor.dnb.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. On today's call, I'll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year results followed by a look back at some of our most significant accomplishments in 2023 and a brief view into our plans for 2024. After that, I'll pass the call over to Bryan for an in-depth review of our results and to discuss our guidance expectations for 2024. We'll then open up the call for Q&A and finish up with a few closing comments. With that, let's get started. We finished off 2023 with not only our strongest quarter of the year, but our strongest quarter since going public. We had organic revenue growth of 5.1%, adjusted EBITDA of $261 million and adjusted net earnings of $140 million or $0.32 of EPS. We beat our guidance in both revenues and earnings. And we're still able to balance continued investment in our new innovations and product enhancements that helped support our 30% vitality index in the quarter. Compared to our original guidance back in February, revenue, organic growth and earnings were all at the high end. And EBITDA came in the middle of our ranges. For the full year, we delivered total revenues of $2,314 million, organic growth of 4.3%, adjusted EBITDA of $892 million and adjusted net earnings of $432 million or $1 of EPS. Our vitality index for the full year finished at 27%, up from 17.5% in 2022 as we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to clients throughout the world. And whether it was in North America growing 5% with a 29% vitality index or International growing 5.3% with a 34% vitality index in the quarter, our value proposition is resonating with businesses in need of data, analytics and workflow to more efficiently and effectively operate in these rapidly changing environments. Businesses throughout the world are coming to us to solve some of their biggest challenges. The three most common themes we are seeing right now play directly into the areas that we had prioritized for our investment. First and foremost, Master Data Management has always been a foundational component of having a sound data strategy, and its importance is increasing significantly with the advent of gen AI. We believe that we are in a privileged position because of the pervasiveness of the D-U-N-S Number, our unparalleled business entity resolution capabilities and the largest and most robust commercial data cloud in the world to capitalize on these exciting trends. Master Data Management continues to be at the core of our growth strategy. And by investing in new, expanded and alternative data sets, integrating our Duns Cloud into the most prolific data delivery platforms and collaborating with the top cloud and gen AI companies in the world, we are making a full push throughout 2024 to take advantage of this coming wave of innovation. Secondly, with the launch of our own AI-powered solutions, we are enhancing our existing products with conversational search, generative insights and improved predictive signals. And we are launching standalone net new capabilities such as AiBE for Hoovers, where clients can utilize conversational search using natural language processing to reduce the friction in helping our clients to more accurately search and target higher propensity prospective companies or ask procurement, which will be in GA at the end of this quarter, where clients can [indiscernible] multiple steps in the sourcing and procurement process, saving days of work and potentially millions of dollars. And while AI is front of mind in our product development prioritization, we aren't ignoring the continued demand for our existing solutions. While we continue to have leading revenue retention rates at 96%, we're also seeing a continued strong demand for our faster-growing solutions such as those in our third-party and supply chain risk management. We delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in that area. And it's no surprise as business leaders, Boards, investors and governments continue to raise the bar on company's understanding of who they are truly doing business with and what the financial, regulatory, social and climate risks associated with those third parties are. Our Duns Cloud now covers 558 million business entities, including UBO data on 352 million shareholders, 270 million businesses with climate risk insights and detailed data-driven ESG ratings on 80 million Duns. And not only do we have unparalleled data on the Company itself, we have also been able to map nearly 35 billion relationships between Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers. We are creating a more real-time predictive performance analytics that continue to create demand in the client verticals we have today and even more importantly, in [indiscernible] goals we are entering by capital markets. Capital markets firms have consumed massive amounts of data over the years to create that last bit of alpha in their evaluation of potential company performance. Through the creation of a new set of capital markets-focused solutions, we have launched into the space with an immediate impact. With our ability to link and enrich a capital markets client data through the Duns hierarchy, add deeply correlated performance insights from our alternative data sets on public companies and deliver unparalleled insights into over 500 million product companies throughout the world, we have just begun to scratch the surface on what is possible in this space. Underpinning these results and the ones that come is a significant progress we continue to make in our back office and cloud migration efforts. We have made significant progress in the completion of our modern quote-to-cash project, which will ultimately allow our go-to-market delivery and finance functions to operate at an even higher level of efficiency and effectiveness. Through the use of best-in-class processes, modern software platforms and artificial intelligence, we will not only save operating expenses but expand revenues through more efficiently closing deals through shortening the time from quote to final signature. We also continue to make large strides in our cloud migration in 2023 and plan to complete even more in 2024. Overall, I am very proud of our team's execution across the Company in both the quarter and the full year. With organic growth approaching 5%, adjusted EBITDA of nearly $900 million, a strengthened balance sheet through improving operating free cash flow and the refinancing of our secured debt layer last month, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making towards our medium-term targets of organic revenue growth acceleration, expanded profitability, deleveraging and enhanced free cash flow conversion. In the quarter and throughout the year, we engaged our clients with urgency, delivered our data and analytics with precision and created new and innovative solutions to satisfy prospects' growing needs. And by doing these three things, we're also able to finish off the year with some really exciting wins and renewals in the quarter. Beginning with North America, where we had a 95% revenue retention for the quarter and 97% retention for the year, I want to start off with the first win to come in the capital market space. It was with one of the world's largest multinational alternative asset management, private equity and financial services companies. Through our structured data, corporate linkage and business signals, we are supporting their efforts in merging and mastering their internal data cloud and also helping to predict viable acquisition targets for investment. These use cases, along with several others such as private credit evaluation, are common for private equity firms throughout the globe. And we see this as a huge opportunity for us going forward. On the more traditional finance solutions use case, we are pleased to announce the expansion of our relationship with Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls is a world leader in smart buildings, creating safe, healthy and sustainable spaces. We expanded our relationship through the addition of a global finance risk solution that was able to eliminate multiple vendors, ultimately demonstrating the scale and value of our integrated solutions. Another great example of a retain-and-expand win was with a leading global aerospace company. This client was rolling off a multiyear agreement, and we work closely with them to execute another multiyear agreement of the same tenure with an expanded set of solutions that includes supply chain risk management, Master Data Management and global trade controls. And we look forward to continuing to help them navigate the increasing global complexities around supply chain and third-party risk management. Speaking of supply chain and global risk management, our International segment, which had 94% revenue retention for the quarter and 93% revenue retention for the year, expanded a relationship with one of the leading ERP providers in the U.K., Sage. Sage added RACI or risk analytics, compliance and intelligence that supports enhanced workflow in the managing and monitoring of supply chain risk and compliance. We also expanded our relationship with Siemens in Germany, a multinational technology conglomerate, who added our sales acceleration tools through Hoovers and a direct plus API integration. We have seen excellent [indiscernible] share growth with Siemens over the past few years as we continue our strategy of landing and expanding the biggest and best companies globally. We signed another multiyear deal with [Cayon], a multinational manufacturer of materials handling equipment. They are using our data blocks integrated directly through their ERP system to manage the global credit risk decisioning. And finally, SEB, a leading Swedish bank added our Master Data Management solutions to support their overall data transformation efforts. SEB is a great example of how companies throughout the world are accelerating their transformation efforts and using D&B as the backbone of their data management strategy. As I said before, if you want to leverage the true power of AI, it starts with rich, reliable, trusted and timely data. And while we have what we believe to be the premier commercial data cloud in the world, we want to continue to strengthen our position through investments in data, cloud capabilities and our most recent gen AI initiatives. Coming off a strong year of financial, sales and operational performance, we are excited about 2024 and continuing the momentum we have been building. We will continue focusing on innovating with urgency, delighting our clients, expanding strategic relationships with key partners, driving a disciplined investment strategy and turning the vast amounts of opportunities in front of us into enhanced results. We plan to build on our areas of strength in third-party and supply chain risk management and Master Data Management, capitalize on new opportunities such as capital markets and gen AI and extract the appropriate amount of value from the investments and enhancements we have made to our existing solutions. We expect another year of accelerated organic growth, increased earnings and continued deleveraging through enhanced profitability and improving free cash flow while balancing near-term financial performance with the proper level of investment in new solution development, enhancements to [indiscernible] solutions, back-office upgrades and gen AI initiatives. In summary, we are on track with achieving the medium-term guidance we set forth at our Investor Day. And we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2024. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan to discuss our financial results for 2023 and outlook for 2024.\nBryan Hipsher: Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and then our outlook for 2024. Turning to Slide 1. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenues were $630 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year quarter and an increase of 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2 million or a diluted earnings per share of less than $0.01 compared to a net income of $23 million for the prior year quarter. The $21 million decrease in net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a higher tax provision in the current year quarter. For full year 2023, revenues were $2,314 million, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year and an increase of 4% before the effect of foreign exchange. On a full year basis, net loss was $47 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.11 compared to a net loss of $2 million for the prior year. Turning to Slide 2. I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $630 million, an increase of 6% or an increase of 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. The increase in adjusted revenues was attributable to balanced growth in our segments along with the positive impact of foreign exchange. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis were up 5.1%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $261 million, an increase of $10 million or 4% primarily due to organic revenue growth, partially offset by associated data and data processing costs and higher benefit expenses as we returned to a more normalized run rate as employees begin to use their health care benefits more than in the prior years. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, which included a 140 basis point negative impact from the increased health care costs I just mentioned. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $140 million or adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $131 million or $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily attributable to higher adjusted EBITDA and higher tax benefits in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, higher interest expense and higher nonoperating expenses. Full year adjusted revenues for the total company were $2,314 million, a [indiscernible] of 4% or 4% before the effect of foreign exchange compared to 2022. The increase was attributable to growth in the underlying business, partially [indiscernible] by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the impact of the divestiture of our business consumer business in Germany in the second quarter of 2022. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis were up 4.3%. Full year adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $892 million, an increase of 3%. Higher adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to revenue growth and lower costs related to professional fees and facilities, partially offset by associated data and data processing costs, higher health care and management incentive plan expenses as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, EBITDA increased 4%. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to the prior year, which included $16 million of increased health care and incentive compensation or a negative impact of 30 basis points. Full year 2023 adjusted net income was $432 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1 compared to 2022 adjusted net income of $440 million or $1.02 per share. Turning now to Slide 3. I will now discuss the results for our two segments, North America and International. In North America, revenues for the fourth quarter were $457 million, an increase of approximately 5% from prior year quarter and also 5% on an organic constant currency basis. In Finance and Risk, revenues were $241 million, an increase of $10 million or 4% due to a net increase in revenue across our third-party and supply chain risk management and finance solutions. For Sales and Marketing, revenues were $215 million, an increase of $12 million or 6%. Sales and Marketing growth was primarily driven by our Master Data Management solutions. North America fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, an increase of $9 million or 4% primarily due to revenue growth and associated data and data processing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 49%, a decrease of 40 bps from the prior year quarter. Turning now to Slide 4. I will now discuss full year results for North America. In North America, revenues for 2023 were $1,644 million, an increase of $57 million or 4% from the prior year. North America revenues on an organic constant currency basis increased 3.7%. North America Finance and Risk full year revenues were $888 million, an increase of $21 million or 2% primarily attributable to a net increase in revenues across our third-party risk, supply chain management and finance solutions, partially offset by decreased revenue from our credibility solutions and from the public sector primarily as a result of the expiration of a government contract in April 2022. North America Sales and Marketing full year revenues increased $36 million or 5% to $756 million. This was primarily driven by growth from our Master Data Management solutions. Full year adjusted EBITDA for North America increased $25 million or 4% to $743 million. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth and associated data and data processing costs, lower net personnel costs and lower costs related to professional fees in facilities, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange associated with our offshore technology team. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 45%, flat to the prior year. Turning to Slide 5. In our International segment, fourth quarter revenues increased 8% to $174 million, an increase of 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. And organic revenues on a constant currency basis increased 5.3%. Finance and Risk revenues were $116 million, an increase of 10% or an increase of 7% before the effect of foreign exchange. This was attributable to growth across all markets, including increased revenues from our U.K. market attributable to growth in our third-party risk and compliance solutions as well as finance analytics, higher revenues from our Worldwide Network alliances related to increased cross-border data fees and higher revenues from Europe driven by growth in finance analytics and our latest API solutions. Sales and Marketing revenues were $57 million, an increase of 6% or an increase of 3% before the effect of foreign exchange. This was primarily due to higher revenues from United Kingdom and European markets driven by higher data sales delivered via our latest API solutions. Fourth quarter International adjusted EBITDA was $55 million, an increase of $6 million or 13%. The increase was driven primarily due to revenue growth from the underlying business, partially offset by higher personnel and data processing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Turning now to Slide 6. In our International segment, full year 2023 revenues increased 5% to $670 million or an increase of 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. And organic revenues on a constant currency basis increased 5.8%. International Finance and Risk full year revenues of $449 million increased 7%, both after and before the effect of foreign exchange. All markets contributed to growth with strong demand for finance analytics and API solutions in the United Kingdom and Europe and higher revenues from Worldwide Network alliances related to increased cross-border data fees. International Sales and Marketing full year revenues of $221 million increased 1% or an increase of 2% before the effect of foreign exchange. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange of $2 million and the impact of the divestiture in 2022 of our business-to-consumer business in Germany of $1.8 million, organic revenues increased 3%. Growth was primarily driven by higher revenues from the U.K. and Europe driven by new to market and localized solutions such as Hoovers as well as higher data sales delivered via our latest API solutions. Full year 2023 International adjusted EBITDA was $215 million, an increase of $13 million or 7%. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to revenue growth from the underlying business, partially offset by higher costs related to personnel and data processing costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA for the corporate segment was a loss of $66 million, an additional loss of $10 million primarily attributable to higher health care and performance-based incentive plan costs. Turning to Slide 7. I'll now walk through our capital structure as of year-end, and then we'll discuss on a pro forma basis taking into effect the debt transactions we recently executed. At the end of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $188 million and total principal amount of debt of $3,589 million. The $3,589 million in principal was made up of $460 million of unsecured notes at 5%, which mature in 2029; term loans of $2,652 million at SOFR plus CSA plus 2.75 that mature in 2026; $452 million at SOFR plus 300 that matures in 2029; and borrowings of $25 million under our revolver. Turning to Slide 8. On January 29, 2024, we successfully refinanced our term loan [indiscernible] credit facilities in a leverage-neutral transaction, which repriced and extended maturities on the entire secure layer of our capital structure. On a pro forma basis, the $3,589 million in principal is made up of $460 million of unsecured notes at 5%, which mature in 2029; a single term loan tranche of $3,104 million repriced at SOFR plus 275 that matures in 2029; and borrowings of $25 million under our revolver repriced at SOFR plus 250 and subject to our leverage-based pricing grid. The revolver maturity was also extended to February 2029. We have a total of $2,750 million floating to fixed interest rate swaps, $250 million effective to February 2025 at 1.69%, $1 billion effective to March 2025 at 3.214% and $1.5 billion to February 2026 at 3.695%. We also have three cross-currency swaps at $125 million each that settle in July of 2024, 2025 and 2026. Currently, 89% of our debt is either fixed or hedged. As of December 31, 2023, we had $825 million available on our $850 million revolving credit facility, and our weighted average interest rate was 6.3%. Our leverage ratio was 3.8x on a net basis, and the credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.3x. We are pleased with our efforts throughout 2023 and in early 2024 to take advantage of favorable market opportunities to proactively address our capital structure's maturities and reduce the cost of our debt. Turning to Slide 9. I'll now walk through our outlook for 2024. Total revenues after the effect of foreign currency are expected to be in the range of $2,400 million to $2,440 million or an increase of approximately 3.7% to 5.4%. This includes an assumption of a modest headwind in the first three quarters of the year, partially offset by a modest tailwind in the fourth quarter due to the effect of foreign currency related to the expected variances between the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Swedish krona. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis are expected to be in the range of 4.1% to 5.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $930 million to $950 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04. Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows. We expect interest expense to be approximately $220 million; depreciation amortization expense to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; and adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 23%. Our effective tax rate takes into account the introduction of the Pillar II minimum tax rate throughout Europe and most significantly in Ireland, where our prior rate was approximately 9%, weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 433 million. And for CapEx, we expect approximately $150 million to $160 million of internally developed software and $45 million of property, plant and equipment and purchased software. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I did want to provide some color on how we expect the year to progress. We expect the first quarter to be closer to the midpoint of our range, second quarter to be around the high end, third to be below the low end and fourth to be around the high end of our range. The lower growth in the third quarter is due to some of our revenues shifting from on delivery to more ratable recognition throughout the year. We expect margins to be flat in the first quarter and then move relative to the revenue growth for the remaining quarters. We are also anticipating operating free cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income excluding the impact of the AR securitization to improve versus the 51% we had in 2023 and make progress towards our target of 80% over the medium term. Overall, we expect 2024 to be another year of stronger financial results with accelerated growth in organic revenues, EBITDA, net earnings, free cash flow and a net leverage metric of around 3.5x by year-end. The team is focused on delivering against our operational and financial objectives. And we look forward to updating you on all the progress in our upcoming calls. With that, we're now happy to open the call for your questions. Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company.\nKyle Peterson: Great. I just wanted to touch a little bit on the building blocks for organic growth here. Good to see that kind of 4% to 5% range. But maybe if you could break down a little bit between whether it's pricing, upsell, cross-sell and new logos, that would be really helpful.\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. Kyle, thanks for the question. As we said, we see about 2% of our growth coming from pricing and incrementally from new logos, upselling of existing solution, cross-selling of existing solutions to clients. And as we see what incrementally has increased, I'd say on the MDM side, the Master Data Management side and the third-party risk and supply chain management side has been more current. As I said in my prepared remarks, on the MDM side, it's the precursor to AI. And I think more clients are seeing that, and there's more of a focus on that. And we have a, I'd say, a right to win in that market and are in a privileged position. And similarly on the supply chain side, we've been doing a lot of great work mapping that out. We've -- as I said, we have mapped out 35 billion relationships. So for example, work we're doing with one of the big three automotive companies. We've mapped 40% of their entire supply chain is what we currently have. And I just don't know if there's anyone that's close to that in this space. So in these areas which you hear a lot about, we've been investing in some pretty impressive capabilities. And in the case of Master Data Management, that's one where we've always been focused on. And now the market is coming to us because of generative AI movement.\nBryan Hipsher: And Anthony, if I could add on too, as you said, price [indiscernible] has traditionally been in that 2% range, raising up to something north of that kind of -- in that 2.5% range this year as a contribution to revenue. And then on the new logo side, I know you mentioned the capital markets win that we had in the fourth quarter. [indiscernible] are certainly, I think, a big pool of potential new logos for us to go after as we've released the new solutions around our capital markets and seeing an impact, I would say, almost immediately as we brought those solutions in the fourth quarter and how the pipeline is building throughout the early first quarter of this year.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's really helpful. And then I know you guys touched a bit on some improving cash flow conversion and kind of working to maybe have some more kind of shareholder-friendly capital return policies. But maybe if you guys could just kind of rank order and remind us what would be some of the priorities for some of the cash flow as that continues to improve here?\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. So the first, Kyle, is investing in the business and driving organic growth. We're committed to the dividend, obviously, and really debt pay down. So when we think about M&A, I'll tell you, the bar, you can see we haven't done anything in the M&A space, relied more on partnership over this last year. The bar is very high for us to do something in the M&A space. We'd have to have extreme conviction on that. The team knows that. So it really is, like I said, focusing on our accelerated organic growth and being very thoughtful about that so where we are increasing it. We've also pulled back in some areas where products where we don't have a lot of growth, we don't see the immediate need for it. So it's not all additive. We're being very thoughtful about where we invest that way and also, obviously, being very focused as you see, our continuous reduction in our leverage ratio.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: I wanted to just try to drill in a little bit on the EBITDA margin forecast for 2024. And just if it's possible for you to maybe disaggregate to guide a little bit. How much of that -- is there more of this health care pressure that we saw in the fourth quarter or that's going to continue versus how much of it is spending on new programs or just more broadly, just kind of typical cost inflation, labor, et cetera? I think you called out data and processing costs and things like that. If you could give us any help just to how to think about lack of expansion in 2024.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. And so when you look at our organic growth and what we expect from, call it, the midpoint of the guide, it's roughly 30 bps of expansion from that perspective. I think we're balancing, obviously, being mindful of continuing to invest in data and then gen AI and continuing to accelerate our organic growth rate. If you look at a couple of those puts and takes, as you said, in 2023 and especially even in the fourth quarter, the health care benefits, right, were increased $6 million for the year. In our incentive compensation, which we have paid down about 80-ish percent across the Company in 2022, was up closer to target in 2023. So those things are really starting to run rate into 2024 where they certainly impacted 2023 more. But outside of that, again, as I said, when we talk about kind of more in that getting towards 50 to 100 bps of margin expansion, 30 bps is kind of on the edge there. Another $5 million or $10 million is something that we're just, again, trying to be mindful around, making sure that we're investing and continuing to accelerate the business because I know we're excited about MDM. I know we're excited about third-party [indiscernible], our opportunities on the gen AI side. Maybe Anthony can talk a little bit more from that perspective. We have a lot of that, that's in front of us. And so trying to be that kind of not penny wise and [indiscernible] is the approach we took this year.\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes, Seth. Just to add on to Bryan's point, our typical margin expense is probably another $5 million, $10 million, which is a relatively small number when you're doing about $950 million of EBITDA. And in particular, in the moment that we're in where we see a lot of this opportunity in front of us, the biggest regret would be if we didn't achieve as much as possible in this growing wave of innovation with generative AI. So again, we're being very thoughtful about it. We're expanding margins 30 basis points in '24. We've got a great growth guide that way, which, again, we'll continue to build into 2025. We feel really good about what that looks like. So again, these are the things that we think are really important and balancing our short-term immediate results, but also our medium to long-term full opportunities here.\nBryan Hipsher: And Seth, just one more piece that's there, bridging items due in 2024. We continue to look at the portfolio, and there was a small [indiscernible], we call it voice of the customer solution set that was about $2.5 million of revenue, $2.5 million in expenses. And we ended up -- we're finishing the sale of that from that perspective, too. So again, that's just something from a modeling perspective. But I think not immaterial, but just something to consider as we see these opportunities that low-margin, no-margin businesses such as those, we want to get them out of the portfolio. So you can kind of see what the true results are really provided.\nSeth Weber: Yes. Makes sense. And then just a follow-up just on the International growth continues to be, I think, better than what we would have thought. Can you -- there are some growing concerns around Europe lately. I mean can you just kind of catch us up on what you're seeing in some of the International markets and how comfortable you are with the outlook for International business in 2024?\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. Yes, we've got a lot of confidence in our International franchise overall and the momentum that we've built there. So there's been a lot of great work taking D&B products localizing from the markets. It's been a great tailwind for us. There has been the creation of new capabilities. So the one I mentioned in my prepared remarks, RACI, which is -- added workflow monitoring to risk and compliance intelligence. And that's one where we started it internationally, and we're bringing that one back to the U.S. But overall, like I said, with Europe specifically to your question, we see that mid-single-digit growth in 2024. And so again, as you look at -- I'm very proud of our team and of the caliber, the performance, how hard everyone works and is committed. With Bisnode, we acquired it, it was a decliner. We got it back to neutral from there. We got it growing a few percent. I think we'll be mid-single digits this year. And so by having more direct control of the client, like we do in Europe right now by owning Bisnode, we're able to get to these large companies. We've had a real nice growth of penetrating larger enterprise clients that are based in Europe. So again, I'm really proud of the team there. They're very focused, and we do have confidence in them in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Anthony, definitely hearing a lot and have been about MDM and supply chain management, and that seems to be driving a lot of the growth. And Bryan, you mentioned portfolio review. Just high level, if you step back, are there products or solutions or areas of the market perhaps that are sort of utilizing resources without generating comparable returns to some of your growth areas? And would D&B or has D&B or will D&B think about reviewing the portfolio in a more holistic way and maybe getting a little more targeted and focused? How do you think about the portfolio overall, I guess?\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. Great question, Andrew. It's something that we focus on all the time. Bryan mentioned just the [finish] business that we're going to divest of. And we did a small B2C business in Europe last year as well. So we're constantly looking at that. But we're also -- we're looking at it because there are certainly parts of where we are investing, I'd say, in the business not getting the return that we would in other parts. But those parts are really critical to us. You think of the credibility business, which has been a headwind and a decliner for us in previous years. We think this year that it will not decline. We'll get it to even or low single-digit growth. The value of the data that we get from that business is really valuable for other parts of our business, which are growing well and driving insights for us, which help us in other parts of our business. And overall, when I look at the return that we're getting by line of business, we certainly are, I'd say, consolidating a number of products, right? So that's going to be a key area where we're going to continue to drive efficiencies. So I think in -- we shut down seven product lines last year alone, where we've migrated -- we've had a lot of success migrating our clients to a more modern solution, and we talked about the importance of that. But in the meantime, we've also been able to shut down the legacy systems there. And there's a lot of work that way. Where I'd say we have probably the most focus, Andrew, is there is opportunity as we continue to completely migrate office system to shut it down then it requires no investment. And while some of the legacy systems exist, they still do require investment, obviously, right? And it could be a low level of investment, obviously, right, from a security perspective, for example, but they still require investment. And that's really where we're focusing our attention in addition, like I said, to the portfolio review.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess my other question is from a data ingestion or data cost standpoint, can you talk a little bit about sort of timeline to the extent you're acquiring new data sets and that's part of the cost structure and maybe one of the things that's limiting what otherwise would have been stronger margin expansion. Can you talk about the path from sort of data ingestion to new product introduction or revenue generation?\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. I'll start, and Bryan, you could tack on from a margin perspective. I -- look, it's certainly an area where as we look at the lead that we have in Master Data Management and we've talked -- we've got the D-U-N-S Number, which is pervasive everywhere, right? And it's a privileged position. Our entity resolution is best-in-class. And obviously, the commercial data that we have in the database we believe is the best in the world and have a lot of proof points around that. So the idea with bringing on additional data is how do we continue to drive enhanced value in that space. And so if we think of some alternative data sources, we're finding real value from them in combination with what we already have and in [indiscernible] with working with our clients. So with the capital markets win that we discussed in the fourth quarter, again, a very, very large player in the space, the -- through this new alternative data that we're having, some of it is really driving the most incremental value, right, on top of all the other data and insights that we have. So that's why it continues to be a really important driver for us and a momentum builder, I'd say. And similarly from an ingestion perspective, the team is doing a great job, obviously, in shrinking the timeline of when we ingest it, when it's available for clients and really simplifying the data supply chain on a steady basis.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. And Andrew, what I would say is that one of the things that we've done a good job of is we continue to invest in data, and we're going to have data processing. That's pretty normal to support the business. This year and 2023, really the component that was kind of abnormal was the $10 million of incentive compensation as we reset some roughly 80% payout in 2022, as I said earlier, to 2023. And then the health care benefits were up about $6 million on a year-over-year basis. And that's just, frankly, people going back more to the doctor, people increasing from a usage of their overall benefits where that had been a little bit, I think, lower certainly coming out of the pandemic and initially from the work from home. So those are two things that are back towards more run rate. But certainly, you add another $16 million on to the $892 million, and you see the expansion from that perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Just a little bit more on data processing costs. You called -- I think you call it data processing, but is it third-party data purchasing or also third-party processing purchasing? And do you feel like we're going to have to continue to talk about this subject from a margin perspective? Or do you feel like you'll be able to realize enough value with the customer is that -- it's not going to be an ongoing subject?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. So Andrew, again, I think we're always going to have obviously our data and data processing, right? So this is, for instance, cloud charges, right? This is the processing charges that we have to support our overall revenue streams. And so it's not necessarily that these things are incrementally or over and above where they should be, right? You're going to have that level of cost embedded within the overall margin structure. And so like I said, really when we think about the typical data cost, that processing costs allows our internal and our data supply chain in our cloud infrastructure. But again, that's normal, right, in terms of us driving the contribution margin that we would expect. Really, as I said, again, in '23, for instance, the abnormal piece was more around some of these kind of resetting of incentive-based compensation across the Company and some of the elevated health care benefits. As we're heading into '24, again, we'll expect normal data and data processing fees, right, that run through. But it's more along the lines of us continuing to drive organic revenue growth. And then it's just being mindful of the environment and where we want to make the investments and push forward in some of the gen AI investments, some of the investments we're making around capital markets, which is where we're expanding margins, but just not pushing them towards the higher end of our expansion ranges.\nOperator: Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to touch on -- I think you said it was 27% was the vitality index. Just hoping a little bit more color on just some more quantification around how you calculate that, maybe the base? And how is that going to contribute to '24 guidance?\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. The way we calculate the vitality index is revenues from newer products that we have. And really, what we're trying to measure with that is do we have a lot of our clients on older products, older solutions. So if you think about at renewal time, you have your best foot forward with the clients or are they on an older solution. So for us, with our vitality index being so high, and it won't always be this high because like I said, it cycles. It's -- and it will probably be in the 20% range, I imagine, which again is, I think, exceptionally high. But what it will do is it will allow us to be in a position of strength on renewals with our clients, number one. Number two, it will -- the way they're architected facilitates us to sell add-on capability because it's built into that infrastructure on our more modern platforms versus what's possible today with some of the legacy ones. So from that perspective, Manav, that's why it's important to us. We're driving higher client satisfaction. We're seeing a lot of great operational results from that and from our renewal rates. It also puts us in a great position from a cross-sell, upsell perspective as we continue to [indiscernible] small bundles, analytics, et cetera, that we can plug in easily and clients can buy easily and they can implement easily.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, Manav, I think to Anthony's point, one, we want to make sure you know one of the vintages from early on is falling off, right, as we head into 2024. So don't be surprised when that [indiscernible] number starts to migrate down this year. But I think when you think about how does that impact guidance, right, it's helping us from a pricing perspective, right? It's helping us obviously from a cross-sell and upsell perspective. Our retention rates, right, continue to be industry highs from that perspective. So it was really important for us to not only invest and upgrade materially solutions that we have. But as we bring on capital markets, right, as we do things like Anthony mentioned ask procurement and Hoovers, these are all things that ultimately fall into supporting the vitality index as we go forward.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And Bryan, maybe just a quick follow-up. Relative to EPS, anything to keep in mind in terms of conversion for free cash flow and stuff?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. So Manav, this year, in particular, on EPS, I think the President of Ireland signed into effect Pillar II on December 18, so late last year. So that had a pretty big obviously impact on a year-over-year basis from that perspective. The tax rate is going from roughly 18% to 23%. You're talking probably in the range of $0.06 from that side. When we think about the conversion component, free cash flow going into adjusted income, a couple of things that are driving that improvement. One, D&A and CapEx are starting to converge. CapEx has come down off of its peak back in on that '21, '22 time frame, and so as those two start to converge, that was always a big component of the gap. And then while we have some of these cloud migrations going on, some of the back-office work, as those wind down as some of those duplicative costs come off, that also helps the two to convert from that perspective.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we take the last question from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I appreciate it. I wanted to go back to the question earlier with regards to investment spend and margin and how you can think about it philosophically going forward. I appreciate that right now, gen AI is a meaningful opportunity. But given that we kind of operate in a world where there's a lot of innovation going on and technology seems to be advancing very fast, kind of how do you think about balancing your margin target, your midterm margin target with the opportunities that you see today and the potential for additional opportunities in the future?\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Heather. No, it's a good question. Look, we're very focused operationally. I mean, we -- well, I'd say, again, looking back at '23 [indiscernible] for the unusual health care and the incentive benefit comps, right? So in terms of the core engine, how it's producing revenues and how the margins are expanding, we see that we have confidence in it. And when we look to 2024 and having margin expansion of 30%, we guided 50 to 100. And like we said, there's about a $5 million to $10 million difference there of investment where I think the number would be much greater typically with the opportunity that's in front of us in front of many in this market with the advent of generative AI. But it's a testament to where we have pulled back spend and where -- and how efficiently I'd say we are spending it and where we are investing. So this isn't something that I'd look at on any given year and look at 2024, 2025 as any given year. I really look at them as inflection points in this industry, I'll say, in the data and analytics industry, there's potential here. And those that really understand that, I think, are really doubling down their investments to take advantage of that space and be foolish for us not to do that. And like I said, it's a relatively small investment that we're making that precludes us from being in the typical margin range that we would be. But like I said, we feel really good that the juice is worth the squeeze.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Anthony Jabbour for his closing comments.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Ryan. As always, I'd like to thank my Dun & Bradstreet colleagues for their exceptional efforts to sustainably grow our business for the years to come and to our great clients for their partnership and guidance. I\u2019d like to thank you for your interest in Dun & Bradstreet. Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference of Dun & Bradstreet has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Sean Anthony, Vice President, Corporate FP&A. Please go ahead.\nSean Anthony: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Dun & Bradstreet's financial results conference call for the third quarter of 2023. On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. Before we begin, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call, including the Q&A portion of the call, may include forward-looking statements related to the expected future results for our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to are described in our earnings release and other SEC filings. Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information, including a reconciliation between non-GAAP financial information to the GAAP financial information, is provided in the press release and supplemental slide presentation. The conference call will be available for replay via webcast through Dun & Bradstreet's Investor Relations website at investor.dnb.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings call. On today's call, I'll start with a brief overview of our third quarter results, followed by an update on our operational activities and progress towards our strategic initiatives. After that, I'll pass the call over to Bryan for an in-depth review of our financial results and to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2023. We'll then open up the call for questions, and then I'll finish up with a few closing comments. With that, let's get started. We delivered a strong third quarter of financial results and operational execution, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.8%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.6% and 40% EBITDA margins. We continue to show both acceleration and durability in the quarter. North America and International continue to capitalize on the need for businesses to better leverage data and analytics in driving both financial and operational improvements, which is only being further magnified by the advancements of generative AI solutions. We're at the forefront of the application of GenAI to business, and we are excited about how clients and prospects are coming to us for guidance and support in implementing this groundbreaking technology. With our data as the backbone for some of the largest and most sophisticated companies throughout the world, we're uniquely positioned to help them achieve their goals of increasing revenues, driving down costs and mitigating risk. As a reminder, we are collaborating with our clients in our D&B.AI Labs, and we'll be launching new products under our AIBE brand. We are also focused internally on ways that this technology can improve our own operational efficiency and access client zero in the development of future commercial offerings. I don't believe there's been a time in our recent history in which our proprietary data, analytics and platform solutions have had more potential, and I'm very excited about the progress we are making and the pace at which we are operating. With that in mind, let's dig in to what we delivered in the third quarter across both our North American and International segments, and then I'll follow up with the latest on our strategic initiatives. Beginning with North America, revenues grew 4.5% in the quarter. Our Finance and Risk solutions grew 5%, driven by strong double-digit growth in risk, consistent growth in finance solutions, and this being the first quarter with no year-over-year impact from the GSA. Sales and Marketing also grew 4%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in our Master Data management solutions. Finance solutions and third-party risk and compliance offerings continue to deliver resilient growth by offering mission-critical solutions that help clients weave their way to an increasingly complex and volatile business environment. Finance Solutions continued its steady growth through delivering incremental value throughout the contract period as well as providing a great client base to upsell and cross-sell additional capabilities. We continue to see strong retention rates and are working with our clients to integrate and deliver our solutions even deeper into the most mission-critical applications and processes within our customers' ERP, AR and other finance-related workloads. Our risk solutions had another excellent quarter, as businesses continue to search for ways to automate and optimize the onboarding, monitoring and management of the third-party supplier networks, whether it's the SEC bringing increased cybersecurity disclosure requirements, the state of California adding incremental ESG and supply chain reporting regulations or Europe's increased adoption of sustainability requirements, businesses are being forced to understand and report on a more detailed level of who they are partnering and doing business with. With one of the world's most comprehensive global risk solutions, we are continuing to capitalize on the increasing demand for know your customer, know your supplier and in general, know your third-party solutions. And we will continue to invest in accelerating these assets over the coming years. Turning to our Sales and Marketing solutions. We saw another solid quarter of 4% growth, driven by our Master Data Management and Sales and Marketing data solution sales. Our Sales and Marketing business is anchored by our MDM solution and therefore, doesn't experience the same dynamics that other Sales and Marketing providers have out in the market. In both good times and bad, highly curated, organized and rapidly accessible data is critical. With our ability to deliver economies of scale through the upsell and cross-sell of our complementary solution sets, we are well positioned to defensively grow our enhanced set of sales and marketing solutions through leveraging our unique positioning with our MDM offerings. Throughout the quarter, we continue to roll out new solutions, deliver significant enhancements to existing platforms and expand upon our strategic partnerships. On the new solutions side, in the SMB space, we launched the D&B concierge service, which allows for the contribution of other proprietary data sets that provide prospects and existing clients the opportunity to create a more holistic picture of their financial profile and therefore, provide themselves an even better opportunity to access much-needed capital to establish or grow their business. This product was launched ahead of schedule and is already outselling our legacy concierge product. It is another great example of our ability to be nimble and execute with urgency. We also brought together a bevy of existing solutions in our new credit insights product that will allow small businesses to have a unified buying experience of products and services that supports them on each step of their growth journey. We also continue to drive new and modified solutions in our most rapidly growing areas. For example, in third-party risk and compliance, we released Compliance Intelligence. I know your third-party monitoring and compliance decision-making solution driven by Dun & Bradstreet's AI-powered data. In Master Data Management, we continue to expand our new D&B Connect Essentials launch and product that takes the power of MDM, but it simplifies it from mid-market utilization, allowing smaller companies to leverage a simplified user interface with prewired algorithms that companies can use right out of the box. As we continue to invest in innovating Sales and Marketing and in Finance and Risk, we see a strong uptake of our new solutions, which further supports our now 26% vitality index in North America. In addition to the GenAI initiatives I mentioned upfront, we also announced at our recent Global Client Conference an expanded partnership with IBM. Together, we will be building and launching new products based on the integration of D&B data and IBM watsonx. This new go-to-market will be a part of IBM's consulting engagements to embed these new capabilities directly into the solutions our joint clients use today as part of their daily workflows. As announced at our conference, the first use cases include foundational entity resolution for any commercial use case and a new ask procurement capability for supply chain risk mitigation. We're excited about bringing together the power of watsonx and AIBE to solve business issues that will ultimately unlock significant value for our clients. Moving on to North American sales. We continue to show resilient growth, which is supportive of our continued acceleration into 2024 and beyond. Overall, our portfolio of solutions is, once again, proving to not only be mission-critical in times of uncertainty, but a strategic path forward so that clients and prospects have the ability to drive a more efficient and effective operation through data and analytics-driven processes, improvements and/or automation. We set out on a strategy four years ago to build not only a growing business, but a sustainably growing business. I'm pleased with the durability that we have built in that time. And with 55% of our North American revenues under multiyear contracts and 53% overall, we continue to progress towards our goal of 60% in the midterm. And not only are we increasing our total amount of revenues under multiyear contracts, we're also seeing the tenure increase. For instance, in the third quarter, we saw the number of four-year-plus deals increased 16% versus the prior year period. This lengthening of contracts is directly proportional to our clients' growing trust and confidence in Dun & Bradstreet as a partner. With over 96% retention rates and a vitality index of 26%, we continue to strengthen our base position with existing customers. In addition, with the introduction of innovative new solutions, we are better able to expand with existing clients and convert new prospects as we broaden our addressable market. On the land and expand front, Coface, a worldwide leader in credit insurance, business information and accounts receivable management, extended their nearly 25-year relationship with us through a multiyear deal that migrates them to our modern Data Blocks solution and creates an opportunity for them to further increase their volumes, while creating economies of scale throughout their credit insurance underwriting operations. From an SMB perspective, we continue to expand our marketplace with the addition of Enova International's OnDeck. Enova continues to look for new and innovative ways to drive increased small business loan origination through a combination of our D&B mobile applications and SMB advertising capabilities, we're able to drive a significant increase in leads to OnDeck to a captive audience of millions of businesses that come through the D&B ecosystem each and every year. And finally, we also had a significant expansion with the Department of Defense. Our client continues to invest in supply chain risk mitigation and foreign investment assessment, enabling further discovery of potential vulnerabilities, identification of industrial-based risk and ultimately, supporting the administration's objective to fortify and strengthen our nation's security. Whether it's in Sales and Marketing, Finance and Risk, public sector or private, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making across our North American segment and the team is laser-focused on closing out the year and maintaining our positive momentum as we head into 2024. Now turning to our International segment. We saw another quarter of strong organic growth at 5.8%, as all regions drove positive growth, including high single digits across U.K., Asia and worldwide network markets. While Europe grew greater than 3% and is up 4% year-to-date, a marked improvement from levels when we acquired the business less than three years ago. We continue to focus on the localization of existing solutions and driving new innovations in our own WWN markets. Most recently, we launched the compliance intelligence module in Risk Analytics, expanded our ESG registered seal in additional WWN markets, and enhance the Hoovers platform with Audience Builder and launched in Central Europe. We continue to see excellent uptake in our new solutions and our vitality index reflected this progress with its rise to 34%. We plan to continue to steadily execute the balance of migrations and the introduction of localized solutions to drive further sustainable growth across our global regions. We are very pleased with the consistent operational execution by our international team. On the sales front, we had another strong quarter. Enterprise accounts remain a key focus of our strategy, and sales growth in this channel is up double digits through the first three quarters. Retention remained healthy in the third quarter at 93%, and we added a few more key names to our growing roster of top-tier multinational clients. Beginning with the significant new business win, we are excited to welcome Munich Re to our D&B client portfolio. We sold a combined solution across both Finance and Risk and Sales and Marketing, in which the value of our end-to-end solution, connected by the D-U-N-S ecosystem, ended up becoming a very compelling offering. We're also able to support Siemens Energy with an MDM solution that allows them to cleanse and curate data from several other acquired companies that built up some inconsistency over time. Another land and expand win in Asia was Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation. We deepened our relationship with the addition of credit decision data blocks that allow them to more efficiently manage the financial underwriting of clients they are handling throughout the region. Again, these are about a handful of examples of strong wins in the quarter. There were many others that continue to provide additional proof points of the strengthening of our global solutions, data and go-to-market team. Whether it's improving our data quality and coverage, migrating and upgrading our infrastructure and back-office systems through cloud migration and system enhancements, adding new clients or coming to market with leading partners, like IBM and Google, we continue on our path of executing against our strategic vision and delivering strong and improving financial results along the way. As we've said before and proven out over time, D&B is a defensible growth asset with significant upside from our merchant opportunities, such as the GenAI revolution, and we will continue to focus our capital and energy on driving accelerated growth, delighting our clients and delivering significant shareholder value. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan to discuss our financial results for the third quarter in more detail and the outlook for the remainder of 2023.\nBryan Hipsher: Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter 2023 results and provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 1. On a GAAP basis, third quarter revenues were $589, an increase of $32 million, or 6% compared to the prior year and 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. Net income for the third quarter was $4 million or a diluted earnings per share of $0.01 compared to net earnings of $8 million for the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 2. I I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the third quarter. Third quarter revenues for the total company were $589 million, an increase of 6% or 4.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by increased growth in the underlying business and the positive impact of foreign exchange. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $235 million, an increase of 6% compared to prior year quarter and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by organic revenue growth contribution, higher performance-based incentive compensation, along with the negative impact of foreign exchange. Third quarter adjusted net income was $116 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.27. The increase in adjusted net income was primarily attributable to higher adjusted EBITDA and higher tax benefit, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, higher interest expense and higher foreign exchange loss in the current year quarter. Turning now to Slide 3. I'll now discuss the results for our two segments, North America and International. In North America, revenues for the third quarter were $421 million, an increase of 4% or 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Finance and Risk revenues were $235 million, an increase of 5%. This was primarily due to double-digit growth in our third-party and supply chain risk management and single-digit growth in finance solutions, which were partially offset by lower revenues from our legacy credibility solutions. Sales and Marketing revenues were $186 million, an increase of 4%. This increase was primarily driven by 5% growth from our Master Data Management solutions and higher Sales and Marketing data sales. North America third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $196 million, an increase of 4%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher costs from data acquisition and processing costs related to our revenue growth and the negative impact of foreign exchange associated with our centralized European technology team. Turning to Slide 4. In our International segment, third quarter revenues were $167 million, an increase of 9% or 5.8% on a constant currency basis. Finance and Risk revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $114 million, an increase of 11% and an increase of 7% before the effect of foreign exchange. There was positive contribution from all markets. Europe and Asia Pacific growth was driven by Finance Analytics and API solutions. WWN alliances was due to higher cross-border data fees. And growth from our U.K. market came from third-party risk and compliance solutions as well as Finance Analytics. Sales and Marketing revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $53 million, an increase of 6% and an increase of 2% before the effect of foreign exchange, primarily due to higher revenue from U.K. and Europe, driven by higher data sales, delivered via our latest API solutions. International third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, an increase of 8%, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to organic revenue growth from the underlying business. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now walk through our capital structure. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $230 million and total principal amount of debt of $3,686 million. The $3,686 million in principal is made up of $460 million of unsecured notes at 5%, which mature in 2029. Term loans of $2,659 million at SOFR plus CSA plus 275 that matures in 2026, $453 million SOFR plus 300 that matures in 2029 and borrowings of $150 million under our revolver. The $2.7 billion term loan has $1 billion floating to fixed swap effective through March 2025 at 3.214%, which was extended from the previous maturity date of March 2024 and a $1.5 billion floating to fixed swap which expires February 2026 at 3.695%. The $453 million term loan has $250 million swap from floating to fix through February 2025 at 1.629%. We also have three cross-currency swaps at $125 million each that settled in July of 2024, '25 and 2026. Currently, 87% of our debt is either fixed or hedged, and it will remain that way through 2024. We had $735 million available on our $850 million revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2023. Overall, our weighted average interest rate was 5.87% as of September 30, 2023. Our leverage ratio was 3.9x on a net basis and the credit facility, senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.4x. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now walk through our outlook for 2023. We expect total revenues after the effect of foreign currency to be in the range of $2,280 million to $2,320 million, or an increase of approximately 2.5% to 4.3%. This includes an updated assumption related to the effect of foreign currency and the expected variances between the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Swedish krona. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis are now expected to be in the range of 3.75% to 4.25% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $880 million to $910 million. The adjusted EBITDA range takes into account a $5 million negative impact from the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, in comparison to the relative flatness of the British pound and Swedish krona. And adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $1. Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows: We now expect adjusted interest expense to be approximately $230 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $115 million to $120 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%; weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $433 million; and for CapEx, we still expect approximately $130 million to $150 million of internally developed software and $30 million of property, plant and equipment in purchased software. Overall, we delivered better-than-expected results and especially, organic revenue growth in Q3 and have tightened and/or raised our ranges for the year. Implied in that is that Q4 expected to be at or around the midpoint of our updated guidance for organic revenue growth with excellent EBITDA and better than communicated EPS delivery, which takes into account the two factors we've discussed since the beginning of the year, our ongoing transformation and what we always expected to be a pretty challenging macro environment overall. In the end, our defensible and resilient solutions are allowing us to do what very few are doing, which is delivering in Q3 and raising up the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance. As Anthony said earlier, we're well positioned to capture the significant growth opportunities in front of us, and we are very pleased with the performance year-to-date. With improving profitability and cash flows, we will continue to prioritize deleveraging the balance sheet further below the 3.9x we are today and focusing capital allocation strategies on driving increased shareholder returns. With that, we're now happy to open up the call for questions. Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Nice to see the improved results. Anthony, the -- lots of good stuff going in the top of the funnel, sounds like new wins and longer contracts and even some new government business. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what's coming out of the bottom? Because it sounds to me like given the vitality index and accelerated new sales and so forth, we should be looking at pretty nice organic revenue growth acceleration next year sort of macro notwithstanding. So just trying to understand maybe some of the puts and takes.\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. Sure, Andrew. Thank you for the question. We're certainly excited about the momentum that we are building. And obviously, for next year, we'll get into that in February when we guide for the year. And there are certainly other factors. There's macro factors out there. But really what we're focused on and what I'm trying to ensure my colleagues are focused on are the things that we control and we see it across all aspects of the business. We're moving very quickly. We're -- I'd say, with our clients, the relationships have never been stronger, never been longer, the types of innovations that we're coming out with. I'm constantly impressed with the speed at which we're running at. And so I do feel really good about the things that we control. And like I've always said, there's a macro effect out there that's affecting many companies. And the force of our transformation, the force of the great work by my colleagues is really helping offset that. So that's what's kind of coming out at the bottom, I'd say, Andrew, is just a macro force offsetting against a transformational force here.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's really helpful. Look forward to hearing more about '24 in February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mazzoni of Wells Fargo.\nJohn Mazzoni: Maybe just a follow-up on that one. Just given the just client demand for longer contracts, I believe more of these kind of four-year plus contracts, could you just talk about really kind of the demand for maybe further send it out as well as just continued progress to that 60% target on multiyear? And really just could you speak to kind of the desire for kind of a single source of truth or just the kind of credibility of the D&B data and more uncertain times?\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, John. Yes, certainly, we're excited with, number one, that we chose the strategy four years ago. I mean it takes work, obviously, extending contracts and obviously building the trust and proving that you're a partner for a long-term contract. And what I'd say from our clients' perspective is they are very pleased. And the data is mattering more and more. So if you think of Master Data Management, right, which we're incredibly strong in because our D-U-N-S number, the linkages, the data coverage that we have, the quality of the data, our Master Data Management skills, all of them, they've never been more important than now at the beginning of generative AI solutions that are being created. And so I think that, in addition to the trust, so we focused before President Biden talked about responsible AI or anyone else. We were first in terms of driving a responsible AI approach. Our clients trust us. We had thousands at our client conference, and it covered a lot around generative AI. And they're looking to us also in terms of how to deploy it. So I think when they look forward and they see all this exciting technology that can really help enable their businesses, they look at us as we've got really high-quality data capabilities around generative AI, and we're thoughtful and we're a trusted partner. So I think all those come together, and they're helping us with these longer-term contracts and again, these really strong client relationships.\nJohn Mazzoni: That's great color. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Looking at kind of the 4Q jumping off point. It's kind of assuming a handle on the actual OCC growth. How should we think about kind of 24% as we break it down into kind of pricing versus penetration and new logos. Just kind of high-level thoughts would be appreciated, if possible.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, sure. And as Anthony said, we're looking to obviously finish out the year strong and build momentum into 2024, which we'll get on and go through in detail in February. One of the key components and why we sit on in the strategy of pushing towards multiyear contracts again. John, I think you remember, we were less than 20% of our revenues were under multiyear contracts when we started. Now it's up over 53%. Embedded in that, too, is natural price escalators. And so when you look at this year being closer to roughly 2% of price contributing from that perspective, stepping up north of that as we head into 2024, that kind of base book of business -- those base price increases are really one of the things that give us continued confidence and really allow us to set on that path of continued acceleration of organic growth that we've been on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.\nAlex Hess: This is Alex Hess, on for Andrew Steinerman. I want to turn to the balance sheet real quick and maybe what your adjusted interest expense implies. Can you remind us, is that an adjusted net interest expense guidance of $230 million or gross? And should we take the interest rate that's implied for 4Q as sort of what you'll be going forward now that you've refinanced the rate swap?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, sure, Alex. So it is adjusted on a net basis. And so from that perspective, I think that is a pretty good run rate. We did the blend and extend on the $1 billion hedge in the quarter, which pushed that out from what was originally March '24 date to March 2025. And so when you think about heading through next year, what kind of rates where they're projected to be, that's going to leave us in a pretty consistent position from that perspective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.\nRonan Kennedy: This is Ronan Kennedy, on for Manav. One of your Sales and Marketing competitors talked about a still challenged environment, where sales in the new cycle is going in to 1Q '24 is likely to remain tough. Could you please expand on what you're seeing in S&M in addition to the prepared remarks. But also overall, how much of your renewals occur in 4Q, 1Q? And how heavy are new sales in these quarters, too, as well, please?\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. What I'd say overall is, from a Sales and Marketing perspective, a large portion of that is our Master Data Management, which is less impacted by macro conditions. And -- so I'm not sure which of the competitors is it. It was probably on the sales acceleration side, where a softer market, and we've seen some of that as well on our sales acceleration business where again, larger enterprise clients shrinking their sales force had less seats. And -- but again, that business is less than $100 million in annual revenues. So it's a smaller part of our Sales and Marketing business compared to our Master Data Management. And -- so I'm not sure if that answers your question or not.\nRonan Kennedy: Yes. Okay. And then as a follow-up, please. A lot of commentary, obviously, on GenAI and the potential there, in addition to the recently hosted GenAI Day, could you help us quantify or give some context around when and how we should see some benefits of the strategy and the numbers from a revenue and a cost standpoint? And then any further commentary on when we should expect to see benefits from the IBM partnership?\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. I think it'd probably cover them off at the same GenAI in general and IBM, and I'd say it's always is a case. The hype always comes before the revenue, and we're all certainly dealing with the hype right now. It's everywhere that you turn, and it's very much on everyone's mind. That being said, we do believe that this is more than hype, and that it is going to materialize. And we've been determined to be first and moving very quickly, whether it's with reaching out to our clients first and having WebExes with live demos, showing them examples of it, leading them, teaching them, obviously, working with many of the industry partners in this space. It's one that we have a high degree of confidence in that it's going to be material to our revenues and earnings as well as our clients' abilities. And so I'd say if you look at what we're doing with some of the examples, they're real. Like I said, there's a massive amount of opportunity. But it's difficult at this stage, I'd say, to quantify what the contributions will be other than I'd say we have a team of highly expert and skilled executives who've been in the industry for a while. And we all share a high degree of confidence that it will be material. We worked very closely with our clients. They're, like I said, leaning in with us, looking to us. And we look at the advantage that we have with really the proprietary nature of our data. And think of it, when we all talk about generative AI, it tends to be around ChatGPT and writing an assay for a student. There's no money in that. It's money when it gets to businesses. And when you have to identify those businesses, that's just space, that's our absolute sweet spot. And so -- and I think the industry really recognizes us being very strong there. So I'm sorry I can't give you specifics at this stage, other than specifics and the confidence level that we all have here that it's going to be material.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: In the International Sales and Marketing business, organic revenue growth is certainly in the low single digits. It's a little bit slower than some of the other segments and geographies. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? And if the lower growth is structural in nature or whether you see it as really cyclically-driven?\nBryan Hipsher: George, thanks for the question. I think as you've seen, overall, our Sales and Marketing businesses continue to perform very well. In International, in particular, we've gone through kind of a series of some pretty big product migrations from that side. And so you saw us first focus on the Finance and Risk component, which is the much bigger from a magnitude perspective. As we're working through the Sales and Marketing, for instance, in the third quarter, there are some legacy solutions, for instance, in the Scandinavian region that were a little bit more, I would say, challenged from that perspective. But that being said, as we're working through the migrations, we're working through the upgrades, we're seeing nice uptake, for instance, in Hoovers. They're starting to roll out some MDM solutions in those regions. We actually expect the Sales and Marketing internationally to pick up in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2024. So it's a little bit of that continued evolution there, but certainly see some good momentum going forward.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then you mentioned seeing higher data costs in the quarter and having that impact margin performance. Can you talk a little bit about some of the trends with data costs and how current pricing within D&B is helping to offset that?\nBryan Hipsher: Sure. And George, if we step back and kind of look at the quarter, the first thing I would say is when you ex out the impact of foreign exchange, we actually increased about 40 bps on a quarter-over-quarter basis from an EBITDA margin perspective. The other side, we had really playing in there was because of our incentive-based, performance-based compensation, we had a little bit higher. It was about $3 million higher in the quarter this year versus last, which I think, Anthony, I would agree is a good thing from that perspective. Really, those data costs are just a function of some of the revenue growth on the COGS side. And so nothing out of the ordinary there. Like I said, we frankly expanded margins when you hold currency constant, and then it was a little bit of performance-based incentive comp that was included in the quarter also.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: You guys have, obviously, done a herculean job in the last four years with all the transformation stuff you guys have put in place. My question to you is, in your two segments, North America and International, can you sort of give me a sense of how much revenue in each segment is left to fix in your mind, sort of ballpark in each segment? That's my first question.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thanks for the question, Craig. What I'd say -- I don't know if I categorize it that way. I'd mentioned in previous calls, when we excluded a couple of businesses, public sector and our credibility business, that the overall growth rate of our company was 5.8%. And I think, right now, if we look at our results today, public sector obviously had improved and turned, and we're aggressively working on credibility like we shared with the new launches of our new capabilities there. But looking at that headwind, we'd be at around the same 5.8% overall as a company. So it's really, I'd say, our focus overall as a company is our credibility business. And -- yes, so if I was to -- maybe to quantify it, I'd say it's kind of in that range. Bryan, would you add anything?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. No, I think that's right, Craig. As we've gotten through a lot of the transformation efforts as we said over these last four years, it's really the legacy credibility solutions, right, that were a bit of a drag in the quarter. And as Anthony said, we're doing things differently. We're bringing new solutions to bear there. But that's certainly something that we're looking to work through the coming quarters and as we head into '24. And then on the International side, again, Neeraj and Anthony's team have done a herculean effort there, right, with what we do with the UKI and owned markets, but also the integration of Bisnode from that perspective. So there's still, I would say, some revenues in that portfolio that are legacy, and we'll look to upgrade and evolve. But again, there, that's pretty common within a portfolio, right? You're constantly growing, innovating, right, sunning down. And so we're going through that cycle. But really, probably the biggest components, that Anthony mentioned is gaining that small business credibility in North America on track.\nCraig Huber: Then a bigger picture question. When you guys think about the macro environment here in the U.S., do you feel like it's getting better, worse or about the same? I realized this up in the Middle East has happened in recent weeks. It might come up with any answer, but how do you sort of feel the macro is doing now, better, worse or about the same?\nAnthony Jabbour: Well, it's interesting, Craig. We survey our clients in a very efficient way. And in September, the business optimism was higher. And so what's interesting is we look at October tends to be another great month for stocks and how a company's stock is performing, affects, their optimism in some ways. But when you look at the underlying data, and so from our perspective, at D&B we have phenomenal insight into businesses because it's the core of what we do. And overall, like I said, there is a bump up in optimism as early as September. And I know it doesn't feel that way right now. So again, as we look at the macro environment, again, I keep pointing back to our team. We don't spend a lot of time on that candidly. We really trying to spend all our time on what can we do? What do we control? We control the speed at which we're improving our company, helping our clients. And so I just want to add that element to it as well, which is the macro will be the macro. Our job is to grow the Company, grow our earnings.\nCraig Huber: If I could ask one more, please. Your small and medium business clients, what percent roughly of your overall revenues do they represent? What's the growth rate there? It's ballpark.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. So Craig, I think we pulled this down in some of the Investor Day decks. But if you look at it on the North America side, it's somewhere roughly around, call it, $130-ish million of revenue. And that's primarily credibility side. We have a mix when you get into the international component. And one of the key, I would say, strategic components for the team over there is to continue to expand with enterprise clients. So you look at a business like Munich Re, you look at obviously, Siemens, et cetera, we've done a really nice job of continuing to expand our base of customers, not from a size perspective, but from a diversity perspective on industry verticals. And so part of the reason I think you see the durability of the business is, we're not overweighted to sectors. We're not overweighted to sizes of the clients. And certainly, I think that comes through in the defensible growth that we've continued to show.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Anthony Jabbour for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you. As always, I'd like to thank my Dun & Bradstreet colleagues for their exceptional efforts to sustainably grow our business for the years to come and to our great clients for their partnership and guidance. Thank you for your interest in Dun & Bradstreet. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, August 3, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sean Anthony, Vice President, Corporate Financial Planning and Analysis. Please go ahead.\nSean Anthony: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Dun & Bradstreet's financial results conference call for the second quarter of 2023. On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. Before we begin, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call, including the Q&A portion of the call, may include forward-looking statements related to the expected future results for our company and are therefore forward-looking statements.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. On today's call, I'll start with a brief overview of our second quarter results, followed by an update on our operational activities and progress towards our strategic initiatives. After that, I'll pass the call over to Bryan for an in-depth review of our results and to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2023. We'll then open up the call for Q&A, and I'll finish up with a few closing comments. With that, let's get started. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which continued to demonstrate the progress we are making in nearly every facet of our business. We're building upon our strength and resiliency in both our North America and international segments through enhancing and expanding our world-class proprietary data sets, solving new use cases for our clients with modernized solutions and rapidly and responsibly beginning to leverage the latest generative AI tools to accelerate our already rapid pace of innovation. We delivered 3.9% revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis, along with maintaining best-in-class margins as businesses throughout the world turn to us as a mission-critical partner that can assist them in accelerating growth, expanding margin and improving their overall risk profiles. Let's now turn to the progress we are making in our 2 segments, and then I'll follow up with the latest on our AI initiatives. Beginning with North America, we continue to drive strong results across our core solution portfolio. While we delivered 2.8% growth overall, Finance Solutions, third-party and supply chain risk management and our sales and marketing solutions grew 5.5%. Finance Solutions and third-party risk and compliance offerings continue to deliver resilient growth by offering mission-critical solutions that help clients weave their way through the increasingly complex business environment. Finance Solutions is achieving continued growth through delivering incremental value throughout the contract period as well as providing a jumping-off point for our upsell and cross-sell strategies. As we continue to successfully migrate clients to our most modern solutions, we are seeing strong retention rates and deeper integration of our solutions into our clients' business and technological workflows. Our Risk Solutions had another great quarter as businesses continue to search for ways to automate and optimize the onboarding, monitoring and managing of the third-party supplier networks. We continue to be the trusted provider of choice for end-to-end business risk monitoring. We also saw significant interest across our fraud, financial, regulatory, compliance, climate and sustainability suite of solutions. As businesses are being impacted through local laws, regulations or overall increased corporate responsibility demands, our risk analytics platform and related data and analytics solutions are rightly positioned to capitalize on these favorable market dynamics. And before I move on to our Sales and Marketing Solutions, I want to touch on the latest developments to our own ESG story. At D&B, it has always been a core value of ours to be a trusted and responsible provider. In doing so, we are committed to running a socially responsible business that balances growing shareholder returns with sustainable practices and strong governance principles. We just completed our annual ESG report, and I'm proud of what we are delivering today and what we have in store for the future. We recently formalized our commitments to ESG through a series of environmental, social and governance pledges, and I'm proud to be part of a company that is focused on doing things the right way. Turning to our North America Sales and Marketing Solutions. We saw another strong quarter of 5.4% growth, driven by our Master Data Management and Digital Marketing Solutions. Clients and prospects are looking to drive profitable growth through the use of data, analytics and artificial intelligence-driven workflows. Our product, technology and data and analytic teams have been working tirelessly to bring high-propensity automated solutions to bear, and it's showing through in our expanding pipeline. As we continue to invest and innovate in Sales and Marketing and in Finance and Risk, we see a strong uptake of our new solutions, which further supports our now 25% vitality index in North America. Throughout the quarter, we continued to roll out new solutions, deliver significant enhancements to existing platforms and expand upon our strategic partnerships. On the new solutions side, we launched the DUNS registered seal in North America, with direct integration into our D&B business directory. If you recall, the DUNS registered seal is one of our most successful products in the Asian market and allow small businesses to promote themselves as a legitimate entity with a sound financial and regulatory profile. And with millions of businesses throughout North America looking to differentiate themselves as a vendor, supplier or borrower of capital, we are providing the initial version of the seal as a way to physically and digitally represent themselves in a manner that both consumers and commercial enterprises can rely upon. We also enhanced our supply chain risk analytics to include Tier N supplier visualization. The Tier N visualization allows enhanced ability to map and interpret a multi-tier supply chain through its numerous components and represents a step function change in supply chain management by providing a new level of detail and insight that was simply not possible before. Companies that have this N-Tier visibility will gain a competitive advantage in terms of cost management, responsiveness and operational performance. On the strategic partnership front, we began to open the door for monetization of our data and analytics solutions through Data Marketplaces. Most recently, we built upon our deepening relationship with Google by making our D&B data sets and products available in the Google Cloud Data Marketplace. I'm proud that we're the first company to populate the Google Data Marketplace, making it easier for our clients to access and utilize these critical solutions while also helping to provide a frictionless procurement process for clients to consume these valuable assets. And along with other strategic partnerships, such as IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Databricks and Snowflake, we are working across the spectrum of providers to allow our clients an agnostic approach to data access and software tools, including the expanding array of artificial intelligence capabilities at D&B. Unique and proprietary data and analytic sets continue to be the key differentiator in the ability to drive increased performance for our clients. The more user-friendly the information is for our clients, the more we are able to land and expand with new clients and prospects. We are also supporting our clients to create increased transparency and consistency in their onboarding of new suppliers. Another initiative launched in the quarter is that Google now requires businesses coming on to Google Play to have a DUNS number. This requirement has worked very well for some other major technology and retail clients of ours and simultaneously has been a great way for us to further broaden the number of small businesses that come to our front door. As we continue to progress on the operational and innovation side, we're also seeing strength on the North American sales front. Retention rates were strong, up 60 basis points versus prior year, and new business wins in the software vertical were examples of the continued demand for our solutions across both Finance and Risk and Sales and Marketing. Beginning with Citibank, we're able to take a long-term existing customer and help them solve new and germane use cases in the Finance and Risk space with one of our most recent alternative data assets. Through the delivery of our shipping data assets, matched with our global corporate family tree, we're able to drive predictive analytics to solve use cases around supply chain risk assessment, enhanced credit risk insight and overall global market trend analysis. I also want to mention how we are supporting Xylem, a water technology provider that supports operations in 150 countries throughout the world. As they look to create a world that is water secure and sustainable, we are able to help them run their financial operations with greater efficiency and overall effectiveness. Through expanding our existing relationship to a multiyear agreement, we are delivering customer onboarding and global credit risk assessments through Finance Analytics and API solutions in supportive of digital modernization, vendor management and global integration efforts. And while Finance and Risk Solutions continue to build strong momentum, the sales and marketing side is making excellent strides as well. We are pleased to reignite our relationship with one of the top five software and technology companies in the world, who signed a multiyear deal with us to support their initiatives around a data and analytics-driven approach to sales operations and planning. Through a combination of our data blocks, analytics, studio, Hoovers and API-based solutions, D&B is powering their ability to drive insightful and educated territory analysis and planning alongside a KYC-based approach to ensure that not only is a business a strong opportunity in the pipeline, but they have the financial and operational wherewithal to be a viable and sound client for the years to come. Another example is our recent multiyear new win with DocuSign, a leader in the e-document and contract life-cycle management software space. Through D&B Connect, Hoovers and our API solutions, we are supporting the build-out of an enterprise-wide Master Data Management solution to support their account management and sales efforts. Through our unmatched business data cloud and industry-leading matching capabilities, we offer clients the ongoing cleansing, matching, appending, enhancing and monitoring they need to make informed decisions at the most critical points in the customer journey. While these are but a handful of examples of what we are doing on the North American sales front, needless to say, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making and the continued strength in landing and expanding upon our exceptional client base. Now turning to our International segment. We saw another quarter of strong organic growth at 6.5%. All regions performed well. Our Asian markets grew mid-teens in the quarter with high single-digit performance from the United Kingdom and Worldwide Network and Europe growing 4.5% organically. We continue to see strong penetration of new localized products launched across Europe, including Hoovers, Finance Analytics and newer APIs. This drove a 500 basis point sequential increase in our Vitality Index to 33%. We saw healthy demand across both Finance and Risk and Sales and Marketing offerings, particularly within Risk and Compliance Solutions, consistent trends that we saw in North America. Through our continued focus on enhancing our customer experience and creating a unified approach across our own networks, I'm very pleased with the continued strength we are showing in our International segment. On the sales front, we had another strong quarter, including delivering double-digit sales growth from enterprise accounts, which is a key focus of our strategy internationally. Retention remained healthy, improving to 94%, and we added a few more key names to our growing roster and successfully cross-sold and upsold solutions to leading multinational clients. Voestalpine, one of the largest steel manufacturers in Europe, signed a multiyear deal for a data block solution to facilitate their sales and marketing Master Data Management strategy. MDM continues to be a very hot area in Europe and especially with large industrials and manufacturers trying to get their arms around a highly complex and fragmented supply chain and customer population. In the U.K., we added a multiyear deal with IWG, or International Workplace Group, the world's third largest office space provider. Through our third-party screening data and monitoring delivered via API, we are supporting their KYC efforts and ensuring that not only the initial underwriting, but the ongoing viability of their suppliers is well instrumented. We also saw a host of large multiyear renewals, including the likes of Bayer, BASF and the Agriculture Bank of China Execute, as we continue to provide our mission-critical solutions to them during these trying economic times. And similar to what I said about North America, I am very pleased with the ongoing progress we have made year-to-date and even more so with the basis in which we are setting ourselves up for accelerated growth over the coming years. And I can't talk about accelerating growth in the coming years without touching on the D&B.AI Labs and AiBE, our framework and platform to leverage generative artificial intelligence to its maximum potential.

So with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan to discuss our financial results for the second quarter in more detail and the outlook for the remainder of 2023.\nBryan Hipsher: Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter 2023 results and provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 1. On a GAAP basis, second quarter revenues were $555 million, an increase of $17 million or 3% compared to the prior year and 4% before the effect of foreign exchange. Net loss for the quarter was $19 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.04 compared to a net loss of $2 million for the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 2. I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the second quarter. Second quarter revenues for the total company were $555 million, an increase of 3% or 4% before the effect of foreign exchange. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis were up 3.9%, driven by increased demand in both our North America and International segments. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $206 million, an increase of 3% compared to the prior year quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenue growth on expected contribution margins, partially offset by increased performance incentive compensation in our corporate segment and a $2 million negative impact of foreign exchange, resulting from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Second quarter adjusted net income was $95 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share, $0.22. The decrease in adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by higher interest expense and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increased adjusted EBITDA and higher tax benefits in the current year quarter. Turning now to Slide 3. I'll now discuss the results for our 2 segments, North America and International. In North America, revenues for the second quarter were $392 million, an increase of 3% or 2.8% on a constant currency basis. Finance and Risk revenues were $211 million, an increase of 1%. This was primarily due to growth in revenues across our Finance Solutions and third-party risk and supply chain management solutions of 5.5%, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our legacy credibility in public sector solutions, which contained the impact from the GSA. Sales and Marketing revenues were $181 million, an increase of 5%. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our Master Data Management and Digital Marketing Solutions. North America second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $173 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%, an increase of 200 basis points from prior year, primarily due to revenue growth and lower costs related to personnel, facilities and professional fees, partially offset by higher data acquisition and data processing costings cost. Turning to Slide 4. In our International segment, second quarter revenues were $163 million, an increase of $7 million or 5% and an increase of 6% before the effect of foreign exchange. organic revenues increased 6.5%. Finance and Risk revenues for the second quarter were $108 million, an increase of $6 million or approximately 6% and an increase of 7% before the effect of foreign exchange. There was positive contribution from all markets. Europe and Asia Pacific growth was driven by Finance Analytics and API solutions. The Worldwide Network alliances was due to higher cross-border data fees, and growth in our United Kingdom market came from third-party risk and Compliance Solutions as well as Finance Analytics. Sales and Marketing revenues for the second quarter of 2023 were $55 million, an increase of $1 million or 2%, and an increase of 4% before the effect of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of our German business-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2022, organic revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher revenues from the United Kingdom and Europe, including strong growth from new and local live solutions like Dun & Bradstreet Hoovers. International second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $49 million, an increase of $3 million or 6%, primarily due to revenue growth from the underlying business, partially offset by higher personnel costs and foreign exchange losses resulting from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now walk through our capital structure. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $261 million and total principal amount of debt of $3,699 million. The $3,699 million in principal is made up of $460 million of unsecured notes at 5%, which mature in 2029; term loans of $2,666 million at SOFR plus CSA plus 325 that matures in 2026, subsequently repriced the SOFR plus CSA plus 300 as of July 25, 2023, and then repriced again on July 31, 2023, to SOFR plus CSA plus 275 in conjunction with the pricing step down associated with our Moody's corporate family rating upgrade to B1; $454 million at SOFR plus 325 that matures in 2029, that also repriced the SOFR plus 300 as of July 31, 2023, in association with the Moody's upgrade; and borrowings of $119 million under our revolver. The $2.7 billion term loan has $1 billion floating to fixed swap effective through March 2024 at 0.4% and a $1.5 billion floating to fixed swap, which expires February 2026 at 3.695%. The $454 million term loan has $250 million swap from floating to fixed through February 2025 at 1.69%. We also have 3 cross-currency swaps at $125 million each that settle in July of 2024, 2025 and 2026. Currently, we are 87% of our debt is either fixed or hedged. We had $731 million available on our $850 million revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2023. And overall, our weighted average interest rate was 5.66% as of June 30, 2023. Our leverage ratio was 4.0x on a net basis, and the credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.4x. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now walk through our updated outlook for 2023. We now expect total revenues after the effect of foreign currency to be in the range of $2,280 million to $2,320 million or an increase of approximately 2.5% to 4.3%. This includes an updated assumption related to the effect of foreign currency and the expected variances between the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Swedish krona. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis are still expected to be in the range of 3% to 4.5% for the full year. As previously discussed, it is important to note that the total inorganic growth rates take into account the conclusion of the existing GSA contract at the end of April 2022. The net impact to organic growth for the full year is a headwind of 30 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $875 million to $915 million. The adjusted EBITDA range also takes into account the conclusion that GSA contract and a $5 million negative impact from the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar in comparison to the relative flatness of the British pound and Swedish krona. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $0.92 to $1.01. Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows: we now expect adjusted interest expense to be approximately $230 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $110 million to $115 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%, weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 433 million, and for CapEx, we still expect approximately $130 million to $150 million of internally developed software and around $30 million of property, plant and equipment and other purchased software. Overall, while the second quarter was a bit stronger than planned, we expect the remaining quarters to be consistent with our original guidance and perform as previously communicated. In conclusion, we are well positioned to capture the significant growth opportunities in front of us, and we are pleased with the performance through the first half of the year. With improving profitability and cash flows, we will continue to prioritize deleveraging the balance sheet and focusing capital allocation strategies on driving increased shareholder returns. With that, we're now happy to open up the call for questions. Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from John Mazzoni from Wells Fargo.\nJohn Mazzoni: Filling in for Seth. Just a quick question. It seems like there's been kind of a reacceleration in growth. Could you just explain what you're seeing in terms of the current selling environment especially on the Sales and Marketing side? It seems like you had a broader-base pickup in both kind of Master Data Management as well as the Digital Solutions, but just with the backdrop of a potential ad recession in the back half of the year. How are you seeing the current? Thanks.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, John. First of all, I'd say that things are looking pretty much like we thought they would at the beginning of the year when we guided. Two forces going on here. There's one, the macro force, and the other one is our transformational force of the business as we continue to improve it. And really, I'd say from a sales cycle, it lengthens a couple of days, contracts a couple of days. For the most part, it's been pretty steady for us, and we expect it to be pretty consistent to the back half of the year as well. But certainly, the solutions that we're offering are very mission-critical in the sales mnd Marketing space. And so they're stickier than you might expect. And I think that also helps with the consistent growth that we're seeing in that business.\nJohn Mazzoni: That's great. Thank you. Then maybe just following up on the mission criticality point. I believe you had 25% vitality in North America and 33% internationally, but how should we think about those kind of translating into higher growth as well as potentially higher structural pricing? Thanks.\nAnthony Jabbour: I know, it's a great question, and I appreciate you asking it on the vitality side because, like I said on calls previously, this takes a tremendous amount of work from our team in terms of, number one, building the new modern solution. There have been many initiatives across the industry where the new modern solution never sees the light of day. Or if it does, the migration suffer to some degree, and companies are stranded with multiple products versus on go-forward one. So I'm very proud of the work our team has done in building the capability and working with clients and migrating them. And like I said, again, previously, there's not a lot of immediate revenue tied to migrating to more modern solutions. But the power is, and you're heading the right direction, John, is that by having your clients on your most modern solutions, it creates for a stronger relationship and ability to sell add-on modules and certainly add strength to our pricing capability. So we're in great shape that way, and we're going to continue staying the course.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham.\nKyle Peterson: I wanted to touch a little bit on the guide, specifically the FX-neutral revenue growth, maybe some of the different drivers that could push you either towards the higher or the lower end, the outlook. I mean it seems like you guys were a little bit closer to the higher end this quarter despite still having about a month of the GSA headwinds. So I just wanted to get a little more color on how much conservatism you guys have baked in there for the second half? And what are some of the puts and takes?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. Kyle, thanks. Ultimately, as Anthony said, we're really pleased with the year-to-date performance from that perspective. As we've talked about, right, the overall year as it shapes up, having that second and third quarter, looking relatively in line and consistent from more towards the middle range of the guide and then the fourth quarter starting to go towards the higher end from that perspective. So again, first quarter, very much in line; second quarter, a little bit better than expected. But we just want to make sure we're being thoughtful, right, with the range that we've laid out. And look, we know that things that could drive us towards the higher end of the range are going to be more sales coming in a little sooner than expected, the usage right picking up and going over and above. But again, they're all around the fringes and why we give a range versus a point estimate.\nKyle Peterson: On the AI opportunity, some good color you guys gave in the prepared remarks. But I just wanted to see how you guys are thinking about some of these opportunities in the near to medium term, whether it's on the revenue side or the efficiency and cost side. I guess, where do you see the biggest near-term applications in terms of having a potential financial impact on the business?\nAnthony Jabbour: Well, Kyle, with the launch of D&B.AI Labs, we've been working with generative AI previously. And so certain aspects of our data collection, we've been bringing in and leveraging some of that already. But our focus right now is with our clients and the commercial aspects for it. And that's why we want to set up a lab environment where we can both come in to a safe place. You'll hear us over and over hitting on the responsible part and even choosing the name AiBE of being responsible. Our clients are really excited about the opportunities of generative AI and large language models, and at the same time, cautious and concerned, right, like many are. And so we want to create a safe place where we can collaborate together in a responsible way. That's the trusted brand that we have at Dun & Bradstreet and we're going to be focusing on initially. You're right, there will be opportunities to drive revenue acceleration as we find ways to help our clients more, and there'll also be ways for us to be more efficient. And we'll be focusing on both of them. What we wanted to get out of the gates first was an external focus with our clients to engage them for them to start working with us on these important initiatives, because we just thought that was more important to be out in front of this and really helping leading our clients through it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead. I'm sorry. It looks like Heather is not anymore here. So next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: I apologize. Can you hear me now?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, we can hear you now, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: I'm sorry. Good morning. I was on mute. I'd have that down by now. But you continue to see nice strength in international markets, particularly in Europe, too, though it doesn't seem like it in your results. But are you seeing any macro pressures in any of these markets?\nAnthony Jabbour: In the International segment specifically?\nStephanie Moore: Yes.\nAnthony Jabbour: No, I'd say for the most part, we've got a really seasoned team leading our International business. And I'd say, for the most part, we see the opportunities that are in front. We've been thoughtful in terms of any of the headwinds. But some of the core again, that's why I talk often about what are macro forces affecting everything and then what are our Dun & Bradstreet transformational forces affecting because it's powerful. So if you think of our International business, we've launched 100 products in localized and in our international markets, which is really helping offset any headwinds that we'd see. And some of the areas like Master Data Management and third-party risk, they're really global strong demand from our travels over there as well, meeting with clients internationally. They're really red-hot priorities there as well. So I'd say for the most part, that every business has headwinds, tailwinds. In the international space, we've got a lot more opportunity, I'd say, than we have downside risk.\nStephanie Moore: Great. No, I really appreciate the color. And then kind of looking at your almost 4% organic growth for the quarter, could you just break out what the split was between pricing, cross-selling, new logos? How you kind of expect that to play out through the balance of the year? Maybe any additional pricing commentary as you think out over the next 12 months. Thank you.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, sure. I think one part even -- start with this, we continue to have a really strong gross retention. I think in North America, it was actually up about 50, 60 bps in the quarter. And so Anthony stocked for a long time, the first thing you do is close the back door. And that's Vitality index reflection. That's the investments we've been making, the continued engagement from our sales force. And so that piece, again, is really solid. And then when you think about the stop, stops, you're absolutely right. Price previously was something that wasn't a big impact. We're now talking it approaching 2-plus percent and starting to accelerate as we stack these renewals on and growth on throughout the year. And then the remainder is really a mix of, I'd say, cross-sell and upsell with a little bit of new product. But certainly, when we look at the Vitality Index, when we look at the migrations, these are all the components, both North America and International, that are contributing to the accelerated growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: Back in. Sorry about that before. I was hoping you could talk about your North America Finance and Risk segment. Stripping out GSA, you called out strength in third-party risk and supply chain, but you also talked about some softness in public sector and small business solutions. Can you talk about where you're seeing areas of strength and some of the softness as well and kind of your expectations for how the year is going to progress.\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure, Heather. I'd say overall from the core businesses that we have in North America are performing well, right? And oftentimes, we try to be transparent with you as to what the underlying engine is producing. And so our core finance and our third-party risk and supply chain risk, our Sales and Marketing is growing about 5.5%. And so that's where we've been very pleased with it. And similar to what I shared, I think it was on our Q4 earnings call about the two areas where it's pulling back to growth, and it's in public sector and it's in the legacy credibility business. And in both of them, we are very focused on turning around those businesses. We've made, I'd say a lot of progress on the public sector side. And we expect to see a turnaround overall in that business in the coming quarters. And on the credibility side, we've got a pretty aggressive transformation in place, really following the consent order that we inherited when we took over the company. We've got a pretty aggressive transformation underway that we're looking to launch later this year, which is a very different approach to the space and we're very excited about what it can do for us. So at a high level, that's really what's going on. We're seeing a lot of great growth in the core parts of our business. Like I said, 90-plus percent of the business is growing in the range that we guided to midterm at our Investor Day 6 months ago. And as we focus on these two businesses, in addition to a lot of the other work we have going on with innovations, migrations and now the new generative AI initiatives on top of it, that's really what our focus is here.\nHeather Balsky: And then as a follow-up, with regards to the margin outlook, can you just help us think through potential cadence for the back half, 3Q versus 4Q?\nBryan Hipsher: Yes, Heather. If we kind of look at it, you'll see continued EBITDA growth in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. I'd say on the margin side, the fourth quarter from just a percentage basis will be where you see a little bit more expansion than where we would see in the third quarter. And some of this is coming in. We had about $2 million of headwind from the FX side in the second quarter. We also had the mix of the GSA revenues coming off and some of the other newer revenues coming on at a strong contribution margin, but just not as high as what the GSA was previously. And then, the final, if you look in the Corporate segment, we had a little bit higher performance-based incentive comp in the second quarter than we did in the previous year. And so those things start to normalize right as the year progresses, and that's the way we would think about the fourth quarter stepping up from the third quarter and again, the third being even better than what the second quarter was.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Anthony. I'd like to know how Hoovers did in the second quarter. And that product has been revitalized and wanted to know how you feel like Hoovers is doing competitively with B2B professional contacts versus other providers out there.\nAnthony Jabbour: Sure. Thank you, Andrew. Yes, our Hoovers business like I said, that was an area that was in radiation and declining quite a bit. And we've got it to, I'd say, a more breakeven pace where it's not a headwind on the business. And we're still seeing it operate at that level right now. We saw some minor pullback of licenses. But for the most part, the business is performing like it has for the last up quarters.\nBryan Hipsher: And Anthony, I would add, too, and Andrew, the balance between North America and International. And so in international, where it's being brought to bear as a net new solution, we're seeing nice growth and acceleration from that perspective too. So overall, I think we're really pleased with the progress we're making in that Hoover space and how we're aggressively going to market there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I just want to follow up on that the second half expectations, particularly in the fourth quarter. That's typically your biggest quarter. I know you've tried to kind of reduce the reliance there. But just talk a little bit about the visibility there and just remind us how much of that in the business there ends up being transactional versus typically recurring.\nBryan Hipsher: Yes. So Manav, it is the largest. We kind of have those bookends, right, and certainly have moderated the magnitude of them, meaning that first quarter from the magnitude is generally about the smallest ride; second and third, relatively similar; and then the fourth is a little bit higher just due to the nature of some of the deliveries that take place and some of the activity that takes place during the quarter. You remember last year, we had a little bit around the fringes on some of the delivery timing of Master Data Management, and we'll be comping that obviously as we go into the fourth quarter of this year but the visibility for this business is quite high, right? And so when we think about the amount of just daily ratable subscription revenues, you're talking about 75-plus percent on deliveries, right, which can be kind of semiannual, quarterly. Our annual deliveries, they're guaranteed in that time period. And then you have some usage on the fringes, again, where may be pulled down in different months. But in a 12-month period, all of that is captured. So when I think about this business and even in the fourth quarter, visibility is quite strong and quite high.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up. Like competitively, have you seen any changes across your segments, but more in particular on the Finance and Risk side?\nAnthony Jabbour: Not really, Manav. Like I said, there are a lot of competitors out there. Obviously, it's a very competitive marketplace. But as we really focus on our game plan and executing well against it. That's really our best strategy and what's proving to be most effective for us. We're working with our clients closely. We're listening. We're servicing them well, getting great ideas. Our teams are working really well together in terms of building new capabilities and servicing client. And that's what we think is obviously really important from that perspective. So look, there's a lot of competition out there, and we all have to work hard for the business that we have. And again, I'd say, like the rest of our business, most of our futures in our control versus in a macro environment or versus what other competitors are doing, I feel strongly that it's in our control. If we work hard, stay focused, we're going to have a great outcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: In the North America Finance and Risk business, you talked about the public sector and SMB trends. Can you elaborate on how those trends progressed over the course of the quarter? And what you're assuming in the second half, whether those trends should be stable or whether we should see some improvement.\nBryan Hipsher: George, it's Bryan. So when we think about those, I mean, certainly, on the government side, right, we've gotten out of the headwind from the GSA. And so that was a component of what we saw in the second quarter. In terms of then continuing to turn sales into revenue, as Anthony said, we would expect the public sector to gradually start to improve through the second half. On the credibility side, that's one where we're lapping that consent order. There's a bit of tail from some of the impacts on the revenue side. So again, as I would expect that to improve, that's probably going to start to improve more in maybe the fourth quarter, right? And certainly into '24 as we're launching our new strategy and solidified vision in terms of what we're going to be doing in that space.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. On the international finance and risk side, you're continuing to see pretty healthy demand despite the uncertain macro environment. What would you say is driving that demand? Is it competitive share wins, wallet share penetration, new client wins, perhaps pricing or upsell? What are some of the details there?\nBryan Hipsher: George, maybe I'll start, and then Anthony, yes. And both of us have spent time with Neeraj and team in strategy sessions and then, as Anthony said, connecting with customers. But some of this macro environment and that uncertainty in these evolutions and kind of global view are really driving this view of Master Data Management, right, understanding who you're doing business with, how you're doing business with them. When you think about that same theme applied on the risk side of the equation, the third parties, the supply chain risk management, it's really critical. And it's critical from so many different components, financial stability, regulatory and compliance stability. Just overall, I would say, ESG and sustainable practices, right. All of these are creating this broader view of the types of companies that you're using as vendor suppliers and the types of companies that you're going out to sell to. So both of those thematics, I would say, are partially driven by an evolution in this overall macro uncertainty.\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. And the one thing I'd add to that is, yes, we continue to penetrate enterprise accounts, work well, listen to them, offer a lot more capability that we now have in markets. And that's really, I'd say, the cause for the greater lift there versus just price increase or something like that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. I've got a broad question here for you. Since the take private transaction early 2019, you guys obviously moved out heaven and earth here to help transform the company here. And so I'm curious, versus your original 5-year plan for the company, what inning do you guys think you're in right now, for sure, what you're originally planning to do here?\nAnthony Jabbour: Craig, thanks for the question. It's interesting from the take private and even the IPO, which was just three years ago, it seems like a long time ago, I'd say we're very much on track, and we're very confident with where we're headed. So initially, in the IPO, we talked about growing from 0% to 3% and then for a period of time and then from 3% to 6%. And three years later, we're above the first range into the second one. And six months ago at our Investor Day, we guided a midterm range of 5% to 7%, where the company is heading. And so I'd say, we're very confident of being where we thought we would be. And again, when we talk about the durability of this business, that's through a global pandemic, conflict in Ukraine, hyperinflation, rising rates, currency volatility, like so much other macro effects out there that, again, it just continues to give me and our team confidence in the quality of this business and the march that we're on in terms of really getting all the growth that we possibly can with this business.\nCraig Huber: And my last question to you, if I could ask, you guys had a pretty cautious view, I recall, coming into the year on the macro environment stuff. I'm just curious, how is that sort of playing out in your mind here? Is it feel better out there, the macro environment like in North America versus what you might have thought coming into the year? It's about the same or worse?\nAnthony Jabbour: Yes. It's always hard at the beginning of the year to talk about what the macro environment is going to be for the coming year. And what I said, we looked at it in two buckets, right? What will the macro do and what will our ongoing transformation provide us to fight any negative macro headwinds? And to a large degree, I feel like the macro is sort of operating in the range that we thought it would. Bryan, do you have any other comments you'd add on macro?\nBryan Hipsher: No. I think, Craig, as we've talked about, it's pretty consistent with our original expectations and flight out that way. And so I think that continues to be our view for the remainder of the year. But it's one of the benefits of having the connectivity of the customers, the insights that we have, the data informs our thinking in how we plan it. And so certainly, we always think about what you say drinking your own champagne. And so that was certainly something that's played out and allowed us to plan and execute appropriately.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Anthony Jabbour. Mr. Jabbour, you can continue.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Sergio. As always, I'd like to thank my Dun & Bradstreet colleagues for their exceptional efforts to sustainably grow our business for the years to come and to our great clients for their partnership and guidance. Thank you for your interest in Dun & Bradstreet and have a wonderful rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you."

      "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Dun & Bradstreet First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Thursday, May 4, 2023.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Sean Anthony, VP, Corporate FP&A. Please go ahead.\nSean Anthony: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Dun & Bradstreet's financial results conference call for the first quarter of 2023. On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. Before we begin, allow me to provide a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements. This call, including the Q&A portion of the call, may include forward-looking statements related to the expected future results for our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to are described in our earnings release and other SEC filings. Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information, including the reconciliation between non-GAAP financial information to the GAAP financial information is provided in the press release and supplemental slide presentation. This conference call will be available for replay via Dun & Bradstreet's Investor Relations website at investor.dnb.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Anthony.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. On today's call, I'll start with a brief overview of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our operational activities and progress towards our strategic initiatives. After that, I'll pass the call over to Bryan for an in-depth review of our results and to discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2023. We'll then open up the call for Q&A, and I'll finish up with a few closing comments. With that, let's get started. Our first quarter results demonstrates a continued progress we are making and the strength and resiliency of our business model throughout the world. We exceeded our communicated expectations by delivering 3.2% revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis as customers and prospects continued to rely on D&B's mission-critical solutions to help them navigate this challenging business environment. Beginning with North America. We grew just over 2% despite this being the final quarter that included the impact from 3 full months of the GSA contract expiration. Excluding the impact of the GSA, North America revenues grew 4% with solid performance in both our Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing solutions. On the Finance & Risk side, our risk solutions drove high-teens growth as companies continued to look at ways of driving a more real-time AI-driven approach to assessing and monitoring the third-party and supply chain exposure. As we continue to expand the magnitude of our existing data and add new and alternative datasets to further expand our offering into areas such as fraud, cybersecurity, climate and ESG, we're positioning ourselves to land and expand through a variety of use cases within clients' risk, compliance and underwriting departments. For example, we recently expanded our ESG Rankings data coverage across public and private companies from 42 million to 74 million and 185 countries, reflecting the latest Sustainability Accounting Board Standards. This expansion further strengthens Dun & Bradstreet's position in the ESG space as organizations seek to make sustainable decisions with confidence. We are also bringing in new real-time financial datasets into our data cloud. An example of this is payments transaction data that allows us to blend near-term transactional behavior with longer-term trends, creating a unique perspective on the financial profile of an entity in ways that have never been done before. These new analytics are enhancing our proprietary data cloud. And through the use of our latest artificial intelligence-driven algorithms, we are further extending our leadership position in the decisioning of commercial credit and embedding ourselves even more deeply into the most mission-critical finance decisioning workflows. Finance Solutions continued to have strong retention rates and is benefiting from the impact of price increases as we look to optimize our contracting and pricing structures. Overall, our Finance & Risk solutions in North America grew 2.5%, excluding the GSA impact, which is right in line with our expectations for the start of the year. Within North America Sales & Marketing, we are seeing continued progress in our financial results from the ongoing transformation and investments in the solution set. We delivered over 5% organic growth in the quarter, driven by our Master Data Management and Digital Marketing solutions. Improvements to solutions like Hoovers have driven retention rates from the 70s to nearly 90%, turning them from headwinds to tailwinds and are allowing the benefits of our transformation efforts to be realized in our financial results. As we continue to resolve a shrinking group of legacy underperforming assets in our portfolio, it allows us to show the true strength we have been building in our Sales & Marketing suite. We also continue to innovate new solutions, which further support our now 20% vitality index in North America. In the first quarter, we launched a mid-market version of D&B Connect that includes a self-guided user interface, which brings most of the benefits of Master Data Management to medium- and smaller-sized companies with limited tech complexity; D&B Compliance Intelligence Engine, which created smart workflow integration to seamlessly onboard and monitor third parties from cradle to grave; and we are launching our SMB Navigate portal, which builds upon the foundational improvements to our SMB ecosystem, such as the website consolidation and shopping cart enhancements we have made over the past few quarters. We continue to move forward with supporting small business and their efforts to thrive during these tough times. Whether it be our partnership with Lendio, allowing SMBs access to capital in a quick and efficient manner; improve the visibility into the commercial credit profile through connectivity and to Plaid; or our latest partnership with Accelerate Tax that helps small business garner tax credits and incentives, we are committed to working hard to assist small businesses become big businesses. On the North American sales front, we saw examples of our momentum in both Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing. On the Finance & Risk side, we had a strong quarter of expanded renewals and new solutions up-sells. One of our largest and most tenured customers, an American-based multinational technology company, signed another multiyear renewal. This company is a great example of a sophisticated global firm that utilize our D-U-N-S and hierarchy and Master Data Management capabilities as a keystone for their finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions throughout their organization. While other providers attempted to compete based solely on price, our differentiated solutions, data and analytics clearly won out. We saw a similar outcome with one of the largest automotive manufacturers in the world. Like many auto manufacturers, they faced the need to invest significant capital into the electronic vehicle market while simultaneously balancing the financial challenges arising from a global economic downturn. With a mandate to reduce third-party spend, their procurement organization explored ways to reduce their spend with us just as they would with the rest of their vendor relationships. However, due to the criticality and value we deliver, they ultimately concluded that descoping services would have a direct negative impact on their operations and ultimately decided to maintain and expand the relationship. Through our Master Data Management capabilities powered by the D-U-N-S Number, we allow companies like them and tens of thousands of others to [Indiscernible] during all economic cycles. Now turning to our International segment. We saw another quarter of solid 5.5% organic growth in the quarter. Our vitality index increased to 28% in the quarter and with all markets growing at or above our internal expectations. We saw the United Kingdom and Ireland produce just under 10% growth in the quarter as demand for our modern Finance & Risk solutions remained elevated. We also saw continued steady improvement in Europe as the business grew 4% in the quarter with balanced growth across the region. Asia came in with low single-digit performance, which was expected as the market is dealing with some hangover from the lockdown impact in 2022 that affected 2022 sales and 2023 revenues. As the year progresses and sales pick up, we expect to see the revenues flow through and acceleration in those regions to complement the strength in our UKI and Europe markets. Overall, the performance is on track. And we continue to see the benefits of the disciplined investments in our international markets. On the sales front, the International segment continues to focus on landing and expanding more and more enterprise clients in the regions. Deutsche Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in Germany, added a compliance solution to their portfolio that is allowing them to better understand their third-party and supply chain risk. This is just one example of what we saw throughout the quarter in terms of strong demand for these solutions. The Cabinet Office of England engaged us for our compliance Data Blocks APIs. Public sector entities, like the Cabinet Office, also have the need to understand who they're doing business with and how the linkage to certain individuals, entities or countries could impact the way they view potential risk with doing business with said companies. We also saw another strategic win with a top four bank in China. This new data-driven win was a direct takeaway from a legacy provider and continues to show how our data, solutions and go-to-market improvements are driving expansion with the largest and most complex organizations in the region. Along with the ongoing results and sales execution, we continue to focus on progressing against the strategic initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day earlier this year. On the technology side, we have made significant progress to start off the year. For instance, on the infrastructure side, we migrated one of our largest and most complex Sales & Marketing applications to our Google Cloud infrastructure. This migration has been underway for months and culminated in a near-seamless transition that has resulted in significant improvements to the application's performance, throughput and stability. We also made significant progress in terms of our ongoing modernization efforts by reducing our reliance on mainframe hardware by 50%. We have significantly reduced our use of mainframe applications and have a clear path to bringing that down to zero over the next two years. These are just a few examples of the many ongoing initiatives we have underway, which reflect our continued discipline, commitment and execution to making the changes necessary to support the long-term and sustainable change at D&B. We also made significant enhancements to our data supply chain through architectural enhancement as well as cloud migration efforts that led to a 50% reduction in processing latency. And while we are continuing to strengthen our foundation, we are also using cutting-edge advancements to extend and expand our analytics capabilities. In terms of linkage and matching, we have the most advanced business-to-business capabilities in the world. And to further extend that lead, we're now leveraging GPT to drive enhancements in our global matching processes, which create efficiencies and, in some cases, incremental advancements in our match rates. We also have three proof of concepts in place related to new business discovery, new contact discovery and employment counts for private businesses throughout the globe. It's early stages now. But through taking a measured approach, we can leverage the power of our unrivaled proprietary business-to-business dataset, combined with GPT and other artificial intelligence advancements, to drive more and more value to our customers and prospects. I'll look to update you on all these advancements and the others on future calls. But in the meantime, know we are hard at work at driving innovation and acceleration each and every day at Dun & Bradstreet. Overall, we're off to a great start to the year, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made to date. Our ongoing transformational efforts have helped to offset a more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. We have capitalized on the strong demand for our solutions, drove strong sales traction, maintained excellent profitability and delivered another quarter of solid financial results. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bryan to discuss our financial results for the first quarter in more detail and the outlook for the remainder of 2023.\nBryan Hipsher: Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter 2023 results and provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 1. On a GAAP basis, first quarter revenues were $540 million, an increase of $4 million or 1% compared to the prior year and 3% before the effect of foreign exchange. Net loss for the first quarter was $34 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.08 compared to a net loss of $31 million for the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 2. I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the first quarter. First quarter revenues for the total company were $540 million, an increase of 1%, or 3% before the effect of foreign exchange. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis were up 3.2%, driven primarily by increased demand in both our North America and International segments. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $190 million or flat to the prior year quarter. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%. Higher earnings from the increase in organic revenues was offset by the impact of foreign exchange, which resulted in a $4 million headwind to EBITDA for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $81 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.19, down primarily from the prior year due to increased interest expense. Turning now to Slide 3. I'll now discuss the results for our two segments: North America and International. In North America, revenues for the first quarter were $375 million, an increase of 2%, or 2.2% on an organic constant currency basis. In Finance & Risk, revenues were $201 million or flat as double-digit growth in our third-party and supply chain risk management solutions were offset by the impact of the GSA contract expiration in April of 2022 and lower revenues in our legacy credibility solutions. In Sales & Marketing, revenues were $174 million, an increase of 5%. This was driven primarily by growth in our Master Data Management and Digital Marketing solutions. North America first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $151 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 40%, a decrease of 150 bps from the prior year due primarily to the margin impact caused by the lower revenues from the expiration of the GSA contract. Turning to Slide 4. In our International segment, first quarter revenues were $166 million, a decrease of $3 million or 2% and an increase of 5% before the effect of foreign exchange. Organic revenues on a constant currency basis increased 5.5%. Finance & Risk revenues for the first quarter of 2023 were $111 million, an increase of $2 million or approximately 2% and an increase of 7% before the effect of foreign exchange. There was positive contribution from all markets. European growth was driven by Finance Analytics and API solutions. The Worldwide Network alliances was due to higher cross-border data fees. And growth from our United Kingdom markets came from third-party and supply chain risk management, along with compliance solutions as well as Finance Analytics. Sales & Marketing revenues for the first quarter of 2023 were $55 million, a decrease of $5 million or 8% and a decrease of 1% before the effect of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of our German business-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2022, organic revenues increased 2%, primarily due to higher revenues from our U.K. market, driven by higher data sales. International first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, an increase of $1 million or 1%, primarily due to revenue growth from the underlying business partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses resulting from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34%, an increase of 100 bps compared to the prior year. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now walk through our capital structure. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $204 million and total principal amount of debt of $3,643 million. The $3,643 million in principal is made up of $460 million of unsecured notes at 5%, which mature in 2029; term loans of $2,673 million, a LIBOR plus 325 that matures in 2026; $455 million at SOFR plus 325 that matures in 2029; and borrowings of $55 million under our revolver. The LIBOR-based term loan has a $1 billion floating to fixed swap effective through March of 2024 at 0.467% and a $1.5 billion floating to fixed swap which expires February 2026 at 3.695%. The SOFR-based term loan has a $250 million swap for floating to fix through February 2025 at 1.629%. We also have 3 cross-currency swaps at $125 million each that settle in July of 2024, 2025 and 2026. We are currently either fixed or hedged at 88%. We had $795 million available on our $850 million revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2023. Overall, our weighted average interest rate was 5.63% as of March 31, 2023. Our leverage ratio was 4.0x on a net basis and the credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.5x. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now walk through our outlook for 2023. We continue to expect total revenues after the effect of foreign currency to be in the range of $2,260 million to $2,300 million or an increase of approximately 1.6% to 3.4%. This includes an assumption of a headwind in the first three quarters of the year, partially offset by a tailwind in the fourth due to the effect of foreign currency related to the expected variances between the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Swedish krona. Revenues on an organic constant currency basis are expected to be in the range of 3% to 4.5% for the full year. As previously discussed, it is important to note that the total inorganic growth ranges take into account the conclusion of the existing GSA contract at the end of April 2022. The net impact to organic growth for the full year is a headwind of 30 basis points with 110 basis points headwind realized in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $870 million to $920 million. The adjusted EBITDA range also takes into account the conclusion of the GSA contract and a $5 million negative impact from the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar in comparison to the relative flatness of the British pound and Swedish krona. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.92 to $1. Additional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows. We continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $240 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $100 million, excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%; weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $433 million; and for CapEx, we expect approximately $130 million to $150 million of internally developed software and about $30 million of property, plant and equipment and purchased software. Overall, as we monitor the macro backdrop, it remains consistent with what we anticipated in our original guidance. And we expect -- and we continue to expect the remaining quarters to perform as previously communicated. In conclusion, we are well positioned to capture the significant growth opportunities in front of us. And we expect to continue to accelerate revenue growth in 2023 despite a challenging overall environment and the conclusion of the GSA headwind at the end of April. With improving profitability and cash flows, we will also focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and focusing capital allocation strategies on driving increased shareholder returns. With that, we're now happy to open up the call for questions. Operator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Seth Weber, Wells Fargo.\nJon Rau: This is Jon filling in for Seth. Could you just maybe give us some more information on kind of the generative AI and what you're seeing in terms of GPT just in terms of how we could think about kind of a longer-term kind of realization of the database and the D-U-N-S Number just with the enhanced linking and matching capabilities as well as any other potential opportunities?\nAnthony Jabbour: No, it's a great question, Jon. And there's obviously a lot of noise about that in the market right now. And there's a lot that we're doing with it currently with our linking and matching on a global basis. And we're seeing efficiencies with that as I shared in my opening comments. We're also doing a number of proof of concepts, like I talked about, and really leveraging this great technology. But the part I want to really highlight for everyone, I think, that's really important, people asked me this before, the advantage that we have is we have a lot of proprietary data that we've had for many, many years and trended data and data that we manufacture insights that we have. And so for us, we have the ability to bring the GPT inside our firewalls, so to speak, and really leverage the technology around our proprietary data. For companies out there that are just accessing public record databases, ChatGPT can do that as well. And there's not really a differentiation in the space that we have because of like the vast proprietary data lake that we have. So it's an exciting time certainly from a technology perspective, and our team is at it. And I actually worked on the previous version of GPT in our contact titling segment within our Sales & Marketing business. So we've been at it for a while, as you'd imagine. We've got dozens and dozens of patents around linking and matching. It's an area that we're really, really strong at.\nJon Rau: And maybe also just sticking on the topic of kind of leveraging the data itself, could you talk more about the supply chain as well as the durability of those revenues, given the partnership with ICE and kind of using the KYC, KYV and the chain within kind of a climate risk offering is unique? How much more runway is there kind of in the kind of overall system?\nAnthony Jabbour: We continue to see really strong growth in our risk business, and we have for many quarters in a row. And we anticipate that we will continue to going forward. It's a very topical subject. And our capabilities are very deep and very broad in that space. And so we're constantly looking at additional insights that help drive the risk of supply chain. I talked about our ESG coverage increasing dramatically. That's one of the most sought-after datasets in our Risk Analytics business. But as you can imagine, we're constantly looking to drive more and more ways that we can leverage data, acquire data, create new analytics that really helps lower the risk threshold for our clients out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kyle Peterson, Needham.\nKyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on -- I know in December, it seems like you guys had some kind of volume pressure, when there was kind of increased macro uncertainty. Have you guys seen any of that either anytime in March or in April kind of in response to some of the regional banking kind of crisis and volatility, or has everything just kind of continued relatively unabated?\nAnthony Jabbour: Kyle, the actual Master Data Management volume that we saw, the blip in December, it was a blip. Early in the ear, we saw it recovering. We continue to see it recovering. Our whole Sales & Marketing business grew organically over 5%. And that was one of the areas where it was a tailwind for our growth in that segment. So we feel really good about that. I'd say on our -- on the regional bank side in terms of what's going on, that's an area that we have very, very low exposure to, I'd say low single-digit percentage of our revenue in that space. We're certainly calling on them with the crisis that's underway. And I'm really proud of our team, how they see a need or a crisis and run to it. And we're certainly running hard to regional banks and larger community banks. That's a segment that typically is focused on commercial businesses and banking. If you think the largest banks in the world having the ability to reach consumers and credit unions with their tax advantage can reach consumer members there, that regional, larger community bank space tends to focus on commercial. And so we've created a lot of new analytic insights that would help improve their underwriting and help identify the risk of what they currently have outstanding, whether it's our Blended Score, where we're taking our credit information on the business, coupled with the consumer scores and giving a unique perspective, or our work with Plaid that we talked about of integrating into the banking accounts and seeing it at a more detailed level and really help assessing the risk that these regional banks have out there right now. But we see it more as an opportunity versus a concern at this stage.\nKyle Peterson: And then maybe just a follow-up. So on the Sales & Marketing business internationally, has there been any macro pressure on demand in that business, or are the headwinds purely from the divestiture of the business in Germany?\nAnthony Jabbour: Well, certainly, the divestiture in Germany was the key -- is a headwind that it was in the space that was really commoditized, not at the heart of what we do and want to focus on as a company. And it's been a really good move for us, I think, from that perspective. But overall, we're excited as we create lots of new capabilities and bring them into our international markets at a faster rate than has ever been done here ever. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey, Truist.\nGus Gala: It's Gus stepping on for Andrew. Just want to talk a little bit on the changes in retention you're experiencing in Hoovers. How can we move that across the portfolio into other applications? And just talk a little bit on the cyclical impact you're seeing on MDM demand. It seems discretionary marketing is under pressure.\nAnthony Jabbour: So the first question is on the improvements that we've made in Hoovers, how we see that across the other parts of our business. When we look -- and we had talked about Hoovers before as being something in need of improvement. And that's what we've been working on. Like we had shared previously, it was in the range of $90 million to $100 million in revenues. And again, with the broad transformation we had underway, this team has been very focused on the big rocks, small rocks, pebbles and sand as they're filling that proverbial jar. And as we worked our way to it, I'm really pleased with the progress that we've been making there. Lots of our businesses, our Master Data Management is very strong. It's not in need of improvement. What we've been doing there is really adding more and more capabilities like the ones I've mentioned in terms of being able to take that capability more mid-market, down-market, where we can create a user interface, makes it easier to work with it. When we think about our Digital Marketing, very strong. So you see what's going on in the broader market around ads and marketing, and this business has been growing very well for us. Because we're at the front end of -- with our programmatic advertising and our digital marketing, we're at the front end of really leveraging the great data we have to make the ads very, very targeted. And so that's an area that I believe we'll continue to do well at. We do have, like we've talked about, some portfolio of $50 million to $75 million scattered of smaller assets that we'll look at transforming, and if the juice isn't worth the squeeze, divesting of. But like I said, as we've gone through the big parts of our transformation, it's really around now getting to the smaller ones and putting attention in addressing them. And like I said, we're excited because we'll either transform them and they will be tailwinds for us or we'll divest them and not have the headwinds affecting us.\nGus Gala: And then can you also talk a little bit on rest of world like pricing actions there? Can you talk a little bit how is the enterprise sales cycle is doing in the pipeline?\nBryan Hipsher: Gus, I would say, across the board, pricing is something that we continue to use as a lever of growth. On the International side, as you remember, when we took over the Bisnode acquisition, there were a lot of kind of legacy and disparate applications that Neeraj and the team spent a lot of time and effort last year migrating them. As we migrate them on to the latest and greatest solutions, you get clearly a better level of customer engagement, customer satisfaction. And so as those are coming up for renewal, we're applying the same methodology of taking a price increase, expanding our multiyear contracts and really starting to see the benefits from that perspective, too. So similar, I would say, playbook that we ran where, to Anthony's point earlier, a lot of the migration, a lot of the underlying foundational work we were doing may not have instantaneous impact. But where you see it is better retention rates. You see it in better ability to take price. And it's the same thing we're seeing in International right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Balsky, Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I'm on a train right now, so hopefully, you can hear me. I'm just -- I'd like to touch on the AI question again. I'd love to hear from you about why you think an upstart can't just take AI, scrape the web and do what you do. What are your -- in that regard, what is your competitive moat?\nAnthony Jabbour: The real big differentiator is that we have proprietary data that cannot be scraped. And we're not exposing it externally so that it can be scraped. So if anything, we have again more upside than downside because we're leveraging this technology ourselves to create more efficiency, identify new insights for our clients and owning it and driving it. There are other low-cost providers out there that really scrape the web. They scrape public registries, for example, and scrape what's publicly available. And yes, a startup leveraging GPT could do that. And it could compete in that space. But for us, the big differentiator we have and why we've been so sticky is the proprietary data. And that is really the biggest differentiator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephanie Moore, Jefferies.\nHans Hoffman: This is Hans on for Stephanie. On the 3.2% organic growth number, could you just break out what the split was between pricing, cross-sell and new logo wins and how you kind of expect that split to kind of play out for the balance of the year?\nBryan Hipsher: We've talked about this year, for instance, with retention rates holding in the high 90s, right? So we talked about the 96%, 97%. They were very strong and consistent within the first quarter. So it really starts there. I think Anthony uses the terminology closing the back door. And you heard what we did with Hoovers, what we continue to do with the solution set is really strong from that perspective. So when we think about price this year, it moving from -- starting to approach roughly 2%, right, is the expectation, right, for 2023. And again, that's kind of blending in some of these new pricing initiatives that we're dropping in, right? And as the renewals come up throughout the year, you'll see that 12-month flip over into the price increase. And that will continue to contribute more and more throughout the back half. On the cross-sell, up-sell, a lot of the deals that we were doing last year in the third quarter, fourth quarter, et cetera, those are flowing through. And so as we build up each and every year, it's really a waterfall from that perspective. So overall, again a nice driver from price, continued expansion from a net revenue perspective with the cross-sell and up-sell. And then it's been really continuing to close that back door and allowing the new innovations and the new solutions to shine through that's been driving the growth. I think we mentioned we had $5.5 million, the -- almost $6 million in the first quarter from the GSA. That drops to $2 million, right, in April of the second quarter. And then we've lapped that and are kind of moving on from that perspective. So again, really good start to the year and look to continue to progress as the year progresses.\nHans Hoffman: And then I guess, what percent of revenues are under long-term contracts? I know you guys have seen some good improvement there over the years. But just for the quarter, if you could remind us what that was [Indiscernible]\u2026\nBryan Hipsher: So multiyear contracts that we talked about are now over 50%. So I think it's -- this quarter, it's exactly about 53%.\nAnthony Jabbour: And what we're seeing, Hans, is clients wanting to sign up for longer term. So our 4-year contracts that we've been signing right now are even up significant. I think they are up strong double digits. So really, it's a great indicator for us that our clients really see us as a strategic partner, who want to stay with us, do more with us over a longer period of time. And so again, the great thing is over that 4-year longer period now, we have more time to cross-sell and up-sell new capabilities and help them versus constantly revisiting the renewal conversation, all while having the pricing escalators.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. I apologize your next question is actually from Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One is the divestitures that you sort of alluded to. I know you made one divestiture in Germany. Talk to us more about what we should expect from here. How are you approaching these divestiture decisions? What's the timing of this? And maybe dimensionalize maybe what percentage of your business is -- I don't know if on notice is the right phrase. But a bit more color would be helpful there.\nBryan Hipsher: As Anthony said, we kind of look at all these things as boulders, rocks, pebbles and sand, right? And so we're now moved through a lot of the boulders and rocks. And there's probably around kind of $50 million, $75 million of these assets that are headwinds, for all intents and purposes. And so what we're looking at, similar to what we looked at Hoovers is, okay, first and foremost, the best outcome for us is to transform it, right? Take it from a headwind to a tailwind through some investment, through some modernization, et cetera. But if we look at something and it's not strategic or we said the juice is not worth the squeeze, then that's where a divestiture would come into play. We're always mindful in terms of divestiture and certainly sundowning or shutting off an application is that we do run a quite leveraged data cloud, a very leveraged infrastructure. And we want to make sure that the cost and the EBITDA impact and the revenue impact is going to be commensurate with what we will do from the revenue side. So again, these are products that maybe are in the range of $10 million, $15 million, the largest being maybe $25 million, $30 million. But it's a very kind of small contained set from that perspective that we're just evaluating in terms of is it worth the investment to and attention to transform? Or is it something that we could kind of easily offload, take the cash from that perspective and then use it to deleverage or allocate capital otherwise appropriately?\nFaiza Alwy: And then as a follow-up, I wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing from your small business customers, I know you have large exposure to those types of customers and a pretty big penetration opportunity. But curious how things are trending with your current customers that maybe fit that bucket.\nAnthony Jabbour: Well, certainly in the small business area, that's a group and a segment that is -- you hear many companies mostly concerned about that segment, how they'll perform in this macro environment that we're in and that we're arguably heading into. And for us, the growing majority of our revenues are around enterprise clients versus small. But what I'd say with the SMB base and what I'd say broadly for all of Dun & Bradstreet is there's headwind that's out there. And there's a tailwind that we have with our transformation that we have underway. And the force from our transformation is helping significantly with the macro forces that are out there. And again, on a company basis, you've seen lots of companies struggle in this environment. And we continue to grow and accelerate our growth year-over-year. And a lot of it is our transformation. Similarly, with small business, that's what's going on. There are headwinds out there with them, certainly. But we've launched a lot of new capabilities in the space. We've talked about some of the partnerships that we had in my prepared remarks for us to help small businesses become stronger. We've seen significant growth in our e-commerce side, which is really tailored towards this SMB segment, right? We have 2.5 million subscribers to our D-U-N-S Manager, our credit products, a 21% increase over last year and over 25% 5-year CAGR. So there's a lot of good work that we have going on as part of our transformation and how we're focused on that segment and growing it to help offset the macro environment. So it's an area, obviously, that we've got close attention to, like I said, in this macro environment. But again, we've got a lot of conviction in how we can help in that space. And that's where we're putting a lot of effort.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Anthony, I heard your encouraging comments earlier on Hoovers. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about it. Specifically, how quickly is Hoovers growing revenues this year? That's one. And my second question is how does Hoovers' U.S. professional contact database coverage compared to its top competitor?\nAnthony Jabbour: What I'd say is -- on the Hoovers perspective, I'll take the first part, Bryan. You could discuss the revenue growth. But lots of great improvement in a couple of areas. One is in terms of our capability. And we've created different versions of Hoovers. We've created a Hoovers Essentials, for example, to be a smaller targeted approach to hit that SMB segment size that we're just talking about is another example there. But our -- the quality of our data has improved significantly. We've talked on calls about dramatic increases in coverage and quality. And it's an area that, like I said, we're very focused on. But also a very focused approach in our go-to-market, so having dedicated sellers really focusing on that and also tying in our other capabilities that we have, such as our credit and risk, right? So like we said, especially heading into -- again, if you're always cognizant of the environment that you're in or heading into, in this one, there will be businesses that will struggle. Do you want to spend a lot of sales resources selling into a company like that or not? That's an area where we can help, obviously, with our clients being even more focused with their time that they spend here. And I'd say on the coverage side, that's always a moving target, Andrew, and how we compare it to others in the industry and everyone always talks about that. What I'd say is with particular decision-makers at companies, our coverage is outstanding. So no one compares to us on a business coverage, so identifying if there's a business out there that meets the need of what you're selling and then working down from there to say we have contacts in this business. We've got a lot of confidence in our -- in the quality of our data, business coverage, key contacts, direct dials, e-mails, et cetera. And like I said, it's a hard one to compare. You get lots of different data points. But what I feel is this significant improvement that we're seeing clearly is a direct result for the improvements and the strength that we have in our data.\nBryan Hipsher: And Andrew, in terms of growth right now, this is a, as you know, quite well a solution set that was actually declining for years. And so for us, part of the story is it's now turning to, I would say, low singles growth at this point but with some really nice momentum as we see the sales build up and the ARR building faster than that, that we expect for it to continue to accelerate throughout the year. And so again, really great progress. And another component for us strategically as we came into the organization was we had some really nice assets in here. And if we can just get some of these ones that are underperforming, turn them around or even just to get them to neutral, right, it allows the rest of the components to really shine through, whether that's third-party risk or Master Data Management, et cetera. And then the opportunity for Hoovers to continue to grow and expand and really take off over the next few years is certainly there. So again, really, really positive momentum and a lot of great work done by the team.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra, RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: I just wanted to focus on the North America F&R business. That business grew 5% in fourth quarter, excluding the government solution. So my question there was is the 2.5% in the first quarter comparable to 5%, or are there some more headwinds on the government solution, which are weighing on the F&R business? And if it's possible to provide that growth profile for F&R excluding the government solution?\nBryan Hipsher: If you look at the two components, one, the GSA is about, I said, $5.5 million, $6 million in the first quarter. That in and of itself is going to weigh heavier on a percentage basis because the first quarter for us is always the lowest from a magnitude perspective. And then the other component is, if you remember, we're lapping some of the headwinds from the legacy credibility business. And so that was another kind of a couple of million dollars that was in the quarter also. And so those two components were really offsetting the growth that we were seeing, as Anthony said, teens growth in the risk business and then kind of low singles on the Finance Solutions side. So when we look at that overall, you're talking closer to being more in the 4-ish percent range, right, than you were the flat when you think about the two pieces that were driving that, which were mainly the GSA side but also a little bit of that credibility, which was impacted by the consent order from last April.\nAshish Sabadra: And maybe just a quick question on the European business or the legacy Bisnode, I was just wondering if you can comment on the progress of migrating all the legacy applications to the D&B. And then obviously, there was a reference to the large financial institution win in Germany. Was that also on the new applications that you've introduced in the European market?\nAnthony Jabbour: Really, really proud of the great work our team there is doing with the European markets and lots of migration work underway there. They migrated thousands and thousands of clients. And you see it in the vitality index, right? It's just almost 28%. And as you know, with vitality index, they don't keep creeping up to get to 100% eventually because it's the last 4 years of new solutions. And so having a score of that range is really exciting. And the team there is focusing on larger enterprise clients, growing with the winners. And our penetration into the large FIs is with our newest offerings that we're bringing to market. And it just gives us, like I said, number one, a more modern solution for us to sell into, which helps us with our renewals. It helps us -- it's modularized. So it's easy to sell components within those suites, the Finance Analytics or Risk Analytics, for example, adding a component to it to make it more easy for our clients to buy and digest and integrate and implement the solution. So couldn't be more proud of really -- and our vitality index in North America was over 20% as well. So a lot of great work, like I said on previous calls, I'll say unsung work in some ways, where you do a lot of effort migrating to a new solution, where there's not an immediate bump in revenue, but you put yourself in a great position to grow. And we're seeing, obviously, lots of green shoots from that growth from having longer relationships with our clients, et cetera.\nOperator: Your next question comes from George Tong, Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: You maintained your 2023 organic revenue growth guide of 3% to 4.5%, which is a relatively wide range. You now have one quarter of performance under your belt. Where in the range do you think you're currently tracking towards, given current momentum in the business?\nBryan Hipsher: George, I think we talked about really being consistent in terms of our expectations since really the earnings call back in February. We had anticipated, I think, a pretty challenging macro backdrop from that perspective when we gave the range. And so as you think about the 3% to 4.5%, that kind of 1.5% spread, that was something that again had already taken into account largely what we thought the macro conditions would be. So very consistent from that perspective and look forward to continuing to execute against our plans.\nGeorge Tong: Related to that prior question, can you elaborate on the overall selling environment that you're seeing, including the state of client budgets and sales cycles as well as how the selling environment changed over the course of the quarter?\nAnthony Jabbour: It's interesting. Overall, I'd say it's pretty common, pretty stable. We had talked about lengthening of sales cycle, shrinking. In Q1, we saw it shrinking a little actually and then later in the quarter, lengthening a bit, but overall, about the same. So it's one we really wouldn't highlight any of the small nuances. And again, I feel the transformation force that we have is very different. So of all the companies out there that have been running perfectly, there's a macro force that hits them and it slows it down. And for us, we hadn't been running perfectly, right? We had an imperfect company that we're focused on making perfect. And the force that we see from our transformation, it helps us to offset a lot of the headwinds that are out there in terms of budgets and sales cycles. But having more solutions, having structure in our contracts that helps from a growth perspective, new capabilities that can help our clients. As I shared in our prepared remarks, we had clients that came and said, hey, I need to cut my budget. And as they work through it with us, descoping or taking away any of the services would have hurt them more than if they didn't do it. And so we've just got some really great mission-critical capabilities that we're really partnering well with our clients. We're servicing our clients better than we've ever serviced them, adding more value capability. And that's where I've asked our team just to stay focused on is not the macro environment, what can we do every day to help our clients be better? And it's resulting in positive growth, where I think, otherwise, it'd be more challenged.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh, Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Maybe taking another shot at that, for Bryan, are you seeing anything in terms of incremental demand from the infrastructure stimulus that's starting to surface in terms of maybe client activity that you'd call out?\nBryan Hipsher: So Kevin, I think -- well, what we're seeing is it's just a continued focus on the things that we thought it would be, right? So on the Finance & Risk side, I mean, that large European entity went into a supply chain and third-party risk product, right, seeing strong demand for Master Data Management, right, really understanding what the risk exposure is, really taking this time that sometimes when things are flying 100 miles down the highway that actually start to think about, okay, what's your longer-term data strategy? Because look, that is a critical thing as we move forward, right? A lot of these advancements in technology, a lot of these advancements in AI, et cetera, they're all great. But like if you don't have the proper data, right, in the proper proprietary data especially that feed into it, those are just kind of empty shelves. And so for us, we're definitely seeing businesses get savvy and smart in terms of wanting to have strong MDM tools, wanting to have strong analytics on both the Finance & Risk and Sales & Marketing side. The Sales & Marketing side, Kevin, what we're seeing is that, that kind of -- I guess, they call it spray and pray, right, is not necessarily an advantageous strategy during the time period, where they have to be more focused, they have to have higher returns. So things like our audiences, our datasets upfront that feed into these online and other digital means from an advertising perspective, we're quite strong from that perspective. And you see that in the high single-digit growth that we talked about in those solutions. So yes, I think overall, it's one of those things that we're kind of balancing, as Anthony would say, some of these macro challenges with our ongoing transformation. And that's what's leading us to continue to be able to progress and accelerate our growth in '23.\nKevin McVeigh: It seems like it's coming together at the right time, for sure.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Anthony Jabbour for closing remarks.\nAnthony Jabbour: Thank you. As always, I'd like to thank my Dun & Bradstreet colleagues for their exceptional efforts and helping us be stronger and stronger every day. And I'd like to thank our great clients for the partnership and guidance. Thank you for your interest in Dun & Bradstreet, and have a wonderful rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines."

      "date": "2024-06-11 09:54:09",
      "content": "Unidentified Analyst: Join Jefferies for next up. Very happy to have Oreste Donzella from KLA, who runs their \u2013 they call their EPC Group, Electronics, Packaging and Components, very hot area within the capital equipment market. He is going to run through a deck, and then after, if we have some time, I'll do the Q&A, but I'll take it over to you, Oreste.\nOreste Donzella: Perfect. Thank you very much. Happy to be back in London after a year. And this is really a dream come true. I mean people talk about semiconductor like there is nothing more important in the world to talk about it. And after 32 years in semiconductor industry, 25 at KLA, seven years working in the fab in TI and Micron for me is like a dream comes true and [a revenge], I guess, my children, they always question me why I'm so excited about semiconductor industry. And I'm still excited, as excited as I was day one in my career. So today, I'm going to talk about a new topic, advanced packaging just because after many, many years, semiconductor, you need to learn something new. But four years ago, we decided to start investing in advanced packaging, packaging overall. It was mostly driven by acquisitions. So we made several acquisitions in the space. We bought a company in Belgium called ICOS. We bought a company in Israel called Orbotech. We bought a company in the financial transaction of Orbotech in the UK that is called SPTS that is doing extremely, extremely well. In a market space that KLA didn't have much knowledge about this real process tools, PVD, etch and CVD, and I'll tell you a little bit the story of the evolution of our journey in packaging since 2020 when we started the journey actually in EPC Group at KLA. So this is, of course, forward-looking statements here. KLA overall, I just have a couple of slides on KLA organization structure. Almost 15,000 people, 2023 revenue was $9.7 billion. We got a little bit of decline in 2023, 8% year decline last year. In a year, it was supposed to be a catastrophe where we got like 8% only down. And this year, of course, we expect the market to stabilize and probably being a little bit up. So these are all the metrics that you care about. And one thing that we are very, very proud because it's the [measurement, our differentiation], our gross margin. So we can command a pretty good gross margin in the company because of our differentiated technology. My CEO, Rick Wallace, all the time, he tells me that the best proof of how differentiated our product portfolio and the solution portfolio is just pretty much to do command high gross margin. This is what we are proud of. So we are in many, many spaces in electronic ecosystem. Of course, in the wafers, logic, memory, specialty legacy, wafer-level packaging and component is particularly available packaging that is going to be the main topic of my speech. But also, we are in printed circuit board and IC substrates, and this is something that we acquired with the Orbotech transaction. And it will become more and more important because some of the advancement in advanced packaging will become a substrate in panel level, and we can leverage at that point our presence in the PCB market as well. Didn't change organization, it has been stable for a few years. So you can feel \u2013 you can see KLA is really a combination of three different business groups. One is our core business, the Semiconductor Process Control, Ahmad manages this organization. This is our inspection and metrology for wafer front-end fabs. Then we have a service organization under Brian. And my organization, the spaces across the edition spaces, not really core semiconductor process controlling wafer fab and mostly packaging, components, PCB subset and the specialty semiconductor process with the acquisition of SPTS. Okay. Now let me talk a little bit about market drivers that are going really to lead into packaging and why it's so important, so critical these days. So first of all, one thing that is absolutely a change in the semiconductor demand is diversification. I put this slide together actually four years ago and it becomes more and more true with all these big emphasis on AI and GPU and HBM, everything that is connected. So when you look at the stagnation years that I would say they were like after the smartphone introduction until probably when the first data center cloud and the hyperscalers started to invest in semiconductor. There was like a decade that the semiconductor industry was not really driving fast growth. It was a time that we said the semiconductor was growing as a GDP, probably semiconductor capital keep GDP plus, but no more than that. Now nobody, I believe in this room has any doubt that semiconductor will grow, a semiconductor capital equipment will grow much faster in GDP in the next five, 10 years because the huge infusion and pervasive participation of semiconductor in everyday life. And it's all about diversification. So and on top of that, of course, AI is the big driver. So I tried just to put together this chart to show how different the GPU package is between 2015 and 2024. So of course, the B100 chip, the GPU introduced a few months ago, and this is not enough because Jensen has already introduced the next generation of GPU last week. And you can see the difference. So was just memory, it was 12 gig now we have 192 gig done in HBM. HBM High Bandwidth Memory means memory that are stacking on top of each other. Nothing changed in the wafer fabrication of these DRAM versus a standard DDR DRAM that goes into the PC or smartphone, the secret sauce is in packaging. So the way our HBM differentiates itself versus the other DRAM chips. It's because in the package, you need to stack all this DRAM on top of each other because you need a lot of DRAM together with the GPU in a package, and you need to be on the same package because you want to have a proximity between the DRAM and the processor inside the same package. That's what HBM is all about. We will talk about HBM, HBM, but from wafer fab point of view, it didn't change much. What changes the way how you package the HBM in the wafer level package assembly line. And you see very, very stunning difference in terms of the area. So we move from 2 by 800 millimeters square. Of course, we are now surpassing 200 billion transistor in a single device memory type is different the size, the package type. Of course, this is another big, big change. Everybody is talking about. If I look at the buzz words, AI is the number one buzz word, everybody talk about AI. And then when you go one level down, what are the other buzz words? One is CoWoS, one is HBM. And by the way, HBM is integrating to CoWoS. CoWoS is real package. And this is what is limiting the capacity of GPU right now. It's not a wafer fab. It's really the ability to stack all this HBM, ship to TSMC. TSMC is packaging on CoWoS, CoWoS package. And then the entire packaging gets assembled generally through OSATs like Amkor, ASE, SPIL and so on. And of course, as I said, there are many things happening in the AI entire device. So starting, of course, the GPU needs a very advanced design from wafer fab point of view. We talked about memory that gets start in packaging and eventually, the CoWoS that put all this together. And when I look at the momentum of AI, and by the way, we are really at the tip of iceberg right now. Think about AI getting all this press, all this CapEx spend, and we are talking about cloud AI. We are talking about really AI in the hyperscale in the cloud. But AI will be implemented the edge or hybrid devices in the future, you will get a ton of demand for AI devices and eventually requiring a lot of semiconductors and a lot of advanced packaging. So this is what we are betting right now in KLA. So semiconductor is going to grow. We are in the right industry. And we have some other segment of these industry that were very, very small, like packaging that is growing even faster than the entire semiconductor market. Okay. Let me go through a little bit of technology slides here. So now you know the driver. I'm talking mostly about AI. I'm talking mostly about advanced packaging. But before advanced packaging because I've been in this industry for a long, long time, I've seen so many technology node scaling. My first job was 1 micron product engineer on a DRAM fab 32 years ago, 1 micron. Now we move from micron to nanometer. Now we are moving angstrom very, very soon. So we see really how pretty much the technology was able to invent itself and make huge progress just scaling the density of the devices and the number of transistors. And this was what, what more lows. So how we can pack double number of transistor in the same piece of silicon every 18 or 24 months. And lithography drove all this. But at a certain point, it always started to slow down, becoming more expensive. EUV scanner is a state-of-the-art tool and the high-NA EUV definitely is going to be the most incredible product that human being has ever produced. But is not enough anymore and it's too expensive. So people are thinking more and more ways how to deliver the performance and required power because it's not only performance. It's not only computing as Lisa Su said many, many times, the NBC or other important players in this industry the computing going to come together with power consumption because power consumption may become the biggest enemy of computing road map in the future. So you see on top of lithography scaling that is happening with the EUV or high-NA EUV, we see transistor architecture changing. So we have seen the transition between planar transistor to finFET. We will see it all around coming, it's coming already. We will see other transistor architecture later. The way how we distribute the power the so-called backside power delivery network right now is pretty much in the road map of the most advanced customers. The way it works is instead of delivering the power on top of your transistors, you deliver from the backside of the wafer, saving space, efficiency and eventually consuming less power at the device level. And then, of course, the topic of my speech is packaging, how you integrate multiple functions coming from different wafers on the same package in a cost-effective way. And this is what heterogenous integration or chiplet is all about. Okay. I'll skip this. Just I want to make sure that on top of 5G, of course, the semiconductor industry is progressing well on front end as well. Package is complementing whatever the front end wafer fabs is doing a lithography level, a transistor level and the power distribution level. So let's talk about packaging and all these vibe around heterogenous integration. So many years ago, there was a concept called SoC, system on a chip. So the big CPU producers at that point, they figure it out and say, I can have multiple functions on the same wafer, on the same chip and everything is getting connected each other. The problem with this approach is you were building a 3-nanometer wafer, for example, with some functions like control logic chips that they don't need to be a 3-nanometer. So why you are wasting 3-nanometer wafer space on functions that don't need to be a 3-nanometer that can be cheaper. So the idea about the heterogenous integration is two ideas really in one. One is I can have a mass cost-effective way to integrate multiple functions in packaging instead only wafer, number one. Number two is because of the computing and power requirement, I need all these functions to be very, very close to each other. And this is what generated the need for the so-called heterogenous integration. So putting more functions of a chip inside a pretty much a package. So building on a different wafers and then cut the wafers and then building this lego block that people call chiplet in packaging. And we have seen many of examples already, all the CPU and GPU right now are made with heterogenous integration packaging, the most advanced one. And there is \u2013 there are many, many ways to package multiple chips at the packaging level together. And from low bandwidth to ultra bandwidth depending on the applications, depending if you are stacking for example, DRAM on DRAM or SRAM on logic or logic on logic, there are multiple integration schemes of these heterogenous functions in a package in a wafer-level packaging architecture. So let me say \u2013 let me give you a couple of examples. One is what we call 2.5D, that is, of course, a CoWos package. This is the NVIDIA chip goes into CoWos packaging architecture and then I'll talk a little bit about 3D hybrid bonding later. And eventually, the way the packaging technology road map is evolving is to get these two together. So the next generation of packaging architecture will have a 2.5D configuration with 3D hybrid bonding on top. So even there are so many flavors of CoWos today that are going to that direction. And eventually, they may find application not only in the very, very expensive cloud high-performance computing ships, but also mobile in the future with different flavors in PC and so on. Whenever the AI is going to implement it on the edge. So that's the reason why the beauty of this packaging technology road map is, we are just at the start. When you talk about CoWos is just a start. When you talk 3D bonding on HBM memory is a start. There are infinite numbers of a potential combination of heterogenous integration architecture in packaging that can be done in the next five, 10 years. So this is the 2.5D here. Of course, you see the HBM on top of each other, connected with the bumps. And then you see the GPU landed on a silicon interposer and the silicon interposer is landing on a substrate. I'm not talking about substrate today much. But as I said, the substrate will become an important component of packaging and substrate is nothing else than very advanced PCB. And now you go back and say, why KLA invested in Orbotech? Well, at least we felt that PCB may evolve in something more technologically advanced. In packaging, we were right. It didn't come yet, but we believe the substrate will become more and more important next \u2013 in the near future and it's going to be much better growth engine for KLA as well. For now, we'll talk about what is happening on top, okay, the substrate? And then of course, you have the big ball connected to PCB. And when you look at 3D packaging, now you talk about two other names, one is Foveros Direct. This is what Intel is trying to build in their foundry market and foundry supply. So this is a big better Intel, of course, is playing to become a foundry, and they become a foundry if they are successful in delivery, this particular package is called Foveros Direct, it is a 3D integration with hybrid bonding. No bumps, but copper-to-copper direct bonding. And then SoIC, of course, is a packaging architecture that TSMC has already built for some premium chips for AMD. So this stuff is already in the market, a very limited, limited, limited volume and is going to grow exponentially if the market will demand more computing at power in the future for AI. So this is the case where you can see the 3D, you don't see bump anymore in the upper part of the graph, and you see chiplet connected to silicon and eventually in this case, copper-to-copper bonding in [die-on-die and die-on-wafer]. Many challenges, and this is where KLA plays a role. Let's start from inspection. I remember four years ago, I was talking to customers and they say, KLA wanted to enter the packaging business in inspection. And this guy said, I don't need you. I mean, I need one micron defect sensitivity. KLA is so advanced and is a front end now. And now we get pressure by the most important customers, they want 100-nanometer defect inspection sensitive packaging. They want 15-nanometer. Just to give an idea, how pretty much adding tools from front end and of course, customized for back-end because remember, the tools that you have in front end not necessary are good for packaging. You need to do a lot of work in customizing the handling, in customizing for the noise source, in customizing for warpage thickness. So everything in package is different. It's not standardized. In front end semiconductor, everything is standardized, in packaging it's customized. So we need to bring this capability from front end customizing for packaging, and we did it. And now people are looking for KLA because on this sophisticated type of packages, they need a front end like inspection capability or metrology capability. That's one big requirement coming up in packaging. The second requirement is that it's important for KLA in the sense that we not only have a process control, as you know, we bought SPTS here in the U.K. that I'm very, very proud to manage in my group. And SPTS is not an inspection metrology organization. It's a PVD, CVD and etch organization. And the good news about SPTS is we don't bring solution from 3-nanometer that are too expensive for packaging in that particular field, we customize and we build a solution for packaging. So our plasma etching tool or our plasma dicing tool is number one in the world because it was developed exactly for the need of packaging technology road map. And that's the reason why you see a lot of challenges here and KLA is working all these challenges inspection, metrology, but also process challenges like etching, or silicon, or plasma singulation of wafer and so on. And as I said, substrate is going to be the next engine for growth. Right now, this is what we did with Orbotech acquisition. We see a little bit of growth momentum there. I believe the real momentum will come in the next few years on the substrate and panel type of inspection and metrology. Okay. And I have a couple of slides to wrap this up again, as I said, a lot of challenges with the new architecture of packaging, heterogenous integration base. And we have a full suite of products, a process tool from SPTS on the wafer side, the plasma etch, dicing CVD and PVD. On the panel side, we have photolithography tool. Basically, in Germany, actually, this is another company we acquired under the Orbotech financial transaction. In Germany, Jena, of course, we have all the inspection and metrology tools coming from semiconductor front end customized for packaging or something that we developed in the last four years probably for packaging. And not only. Another thing that is important about KLA is when I want to \u2013 and I have been exposed to this company for a long, long time as an employee and before then as a customer. I believe, KLA, if I want to define a KLA, I would say KLA is a data company. So we produce an insane amount of data out of our inspection and metrology tools. Now the question is what do you do with the data? Many, many years ago, KLA invented a new way in semiconductor wafer fab to analyze \u2013 collect, analyze and manipulate the data in the wafer fabs. And 95% of the fabs in the world use our data analytics hub what we call Klarity. And the beauty of this is all the data in the fab regardless if \u2013 this is an open architecture software. I don't care if the data come from this software, doesn't care if they come from KLA tool or competitive tool, they get integrated and connecting our data analytic hub. And then eventually, you can produce feedback to correction loop that can improve the process based on the data you collect from the inspection metrology tool. It's a feedback, feedforward loop. So we are doing this for packaging right now. And I got to tell you there is a huge enthusiasm to have the same capability that KLA developed in the front end wafer fabs now driving data analytics and correction loop in packaging. It's a massive opportunity because, as I said, packaging is not standardized. And there is no concept of really monetize and materialize and capitalize on data and we are building this infrastructure right now. So not only tools but also developing data analytical software and algorithms and so on. And that's my final slide, and I think speak by itself. This is what we are forecasting this year revenue packaging, huge leap. So you can see we are almost doubling the revenue in 2024. We just gave \u2013 actually four weeks ago, it was $400 million. And then in the last four weeks, we got a lot of orders. And then Bren, Kevin and I were talking about or maybe we should say pretty much keep updating because in reality, especially for silicon interposer and CoWos, heterogenous integration architecture with HBM memory there is incredible appetite right now for demand and of course, for demand of capital equipment to develop these kind of packages. And we expect pretty much to land in $450 million, $500 million of revenue this year as a packaging revenue for entire KLA. And this is my last line.\nUnidentified Analyst: I mean amazing timing. It just clicked zero. So you're an expert.\nOreste Donzella: Yes. I didn't check.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.\nOreste Donzella: By the way, thank you very much, and I'm \u2013 again, I'm very, very glad to be here last year with a different topic. Actually, last year, I talked a little bit about silicone carbide in automotive. That was a huge wave last year. Now it's kind of flattening a little bit. Packaging is the new one. Probably next year, I'm going to talk about something else. Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate that.\nQ - :"

      "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the June 2023 quarter and our September quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close, along with supplemental materials that are all available on our IR website. \n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. \n Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. \n Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. \n Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. \n KLA's June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. \n GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges. As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries. \n Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase when faster time to yield is critical. \n KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership in process control, which includes some of the most critical and fastest-growing segments of WFE.  \n Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and reticle infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA. For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. \n The KLA Services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements. \n I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 billion to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix as upside in the quarter was driven by higher-margin products, normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjusts to current demand expectations. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised $314 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense net was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%. With the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower or $5.33. \n Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million, GAAP net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million and free cash flow was $880 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119% and free cash flow margin was 37%. \n The company had approximately 137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; debt of $5.89 billion; and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. \n Turning to our outlook. Our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business and we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year. \n Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%; foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall, with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes. \n KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. \n In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. \n Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70% and memory is expected to be around 30% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND at 10%. \n We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%.  \n Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. \n Finally, GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully-diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares. \n In conclusion, we continue to see process controls' importance to technology transitions and advancements key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. \n As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023. Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling. \n Broadening semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have at lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n While a global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. Per the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. \n Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. \n I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide instructions and queue for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the strength that you're seeing in your blank wafer business. How do you see that looking into next year? And is there a risk of maybe some digestion after a pretty strong investment cycle there? \nBren Higgins: Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply. It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical. \n  But the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers takes some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand. They're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging techniques that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well. \n So as we look at this year, it's going to continue to grow this year, expect it to do well. And then -- but I do think as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys saw some pretty, I think, significant upside to your memory kind of expectations or at least relative to what you were thinking 3 months ago, and particularly around DRAM. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what drove that in the quarter? \nBren Higgins: Sure. We had some movement across a number of our customers, and the number overall is, frankly, pretty low. But that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to 1 of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, can you update us on where optical inspection lead times are? And given the importance of that tool set for R&D lines, is that something that you expect will sustain at elevated levels? Or do you think that should normalize over time? \nRichard Wallace: C.J., it's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through, as far as we can see, into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing. So we expect that to remain elevated and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24 and beyond, we'll see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time. \nRichard Wallace: One of the nice -- we talked about in the past, C.J., is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5. And Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in places that we didn't necessarily forecast, like automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, encouraging to see your Semi Services business grow sequentially. Can you kind of comment on how you see that playing out in the second half? And what kind of potentially negative impact are you seeing from lower utilization from your memory customers? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. We're very pleased with the performance in Services. And it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see Services utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization, asking us to back off a little bit. \n And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what had been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading-edge logic/foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard. But it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the Services business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I chose -- the first one, Rick, obviously, you have like very strong revenues from China. There's been some chatter that the U.S. might expand export controls, even maybe mature nodes. I know right now, you're capped at 14-nanometer and below for foundry/logic. Is there any commentary you can give on that? And how to think about it, like, let's say, for example, 14 goes to 28, the restriction, or 28 goes to 40. Is there a way to quantify the impact to your sales? And then I have a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, I won't speculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really, we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. \n Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China is legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick. And then as a follow-up, based on the numbers, it looks like you're going to outperform WFE again this year, and you do this last couple of years. The last couple of years, it is more -- some of your peers were supply chain constrained while you were not. And this year, obviously, there's a lot of technology buys. \n I'm just wondering, as we head into next year or the next couple of years, as WFE starts rebounding, is there a risk that some of the fabs already bought process control equipment, that you could actually underperform WFE? \nRichard Wallace: Well, so I would say that we were supply-constrained, but for a different reason. We couldn't -- we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we managed our supply chain, but we still had gaps. \n It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up. I mean 1 thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing play out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and on more layers and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control and that's really what we're experiencing. \n So when we talked about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out, is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the -- we stick to the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: Congrats on the good results. A few of your peers have talked about fab readiness being impacting their shipment this year, especially for EUV tools. Is that something that you already kind of factored in your WFE outlook you gave a quarter ago, when you also said foundry/logic would be down 10%, which you reiterate today? Or are there some other offsets that you would point out that kind of offset that? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It's -- it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so while there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. \n But it's something that we had already made adjustments for. I think it tends to -- usually, shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively -- eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. \nSidney Ho: Okay. Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, speaking of China, I know the revenue is now back to the 30% level. You talked about some of the shipments that came in a little earlier. But I want to ask a little bit different angle. It's clear that there is a big push for self-sufficiency in China, but certain tool sets are harder to replace than others. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on the competitive dynamics there, that some of your process control clients could be satisfied by domestic companies? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, our market share continues to be strong. I mean we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, restarted some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive, really, at all price points in terms of -- so we feel while there is more competition at trailing edge, we're very well positioned to be able to win. \n And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So we feel good about our ability to compete against any competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So this is not unique, that we would have competition in China. \nBren Higgins: And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So we can -- we can offer lots of solutions to our customers. To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even deconfigured versions of more recent tools. \n And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements, either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: I guess understanding again that memory investment in general is reduced, and it sounds like the China memory shipment might have hit there in the June quarter, but if I were to assume that some of your DRAM activity in coming quarters will be more geared toward DDR5 and applications for high-performance, high-density DRAM for data center and AI applications, are you noticing or anticipating a higher level of process control intensity for that kind of spend? \nBren Higgins: Well look, for more advanced -- for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and reticle fidelity. That's been a driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years. And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see it. \n I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year. But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to see a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments. Now we will participate in process node development, as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. \nBrian Chin: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader follow-up question. Obviously, there's some underutilization of capacity at the leading foundries, more advanced FinFET nodes. And this might just be a cyclical phenomena, but in your conversations with them, do you detect any changes in how they might elect to deploy capital in support of multiple advanced nodes differently? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I mean they've slowed down. I mean for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So I think that's been the main one. What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we've had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. \n The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced node and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing, but I think that the slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that looks pretty good as we get the next few quarters behind us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, can you give the purchase obligation number? I think it was about $12 billion last quarter. I assume it came down a smidge and book-to-bill is still less than 1. And then also, can you tell us how much is sitting outside of 12 months, that number? \nBren Higgins: So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than 1. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to $11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it, which we deliver beyond the 12-month window. \nTimothy Arcuri: Cool. And then, Bren, just for the top guide for December, it sounds like process control system shipments are pretty flat. It looks like maybe EPC should be up a smidge because you had said before that EPC would be about -- down about 20% for the year. So is that right? And I guess part of that was that you had said last call that maybe the process control shipments in December depended on a couple of projects. So sort of what's the -- what are the puts and takes on process control shipments in December? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I don't want to get specific on guiding December. But certainly, consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward. And obviously, that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. \n And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments. That being said, Services continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter, just like it generally always has, as the installed base continues to grow over time, and so we see growth in Services. \n EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile. So I -- I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see -- it's a good indicator given its short lead time, it's more capacity-centric, it's closer to consumer. So it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover, because it weakened earlier, and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the Semi PC part of it. \n And then so Semi PC I think will generally be somewhat consistent with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter. \n Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year, we'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December. And so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame, we're -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Maybe as a follow-up to Tim's question, your prior view was for process control to be down roughly kind of mid-teens, right, relative to WFE, which was down 20%. Now off of the better June quarter results and if I flatline stabilize that process control for the remainder of the calendar year after the June quarter, it looks like your process control franchise is actually going to be down only 10% to 12% for the full year. So even better outperformance versus WFE. \n You mentioned mask inspection, bare wafer, strong dynamics. Like what other product segments are driving the better implied outlook for process control? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about bare wafer obviously being a strong driver, optical inspection. Reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. \n So we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there. Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control intensity there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. \nHarlan Sur: I appreciate that. Is that advanced packaging demand is kicking off quite strongly, right, driven by all these accelerated compute workloads like AI, right? You have HBM, CoWoS packaging, multichip stack-die configuration. TSMC, Intel, all the memory guys, the old stacks, right, you guys supplying to all of them. Are you seeing the demand pick up for your solutions for accelerated compute applications? And is the advanced packaging segment growing this year for the team? Or is that sort of AI accelerated compute demand being somewhat offset by some of the more consumer-focused end markets? \nRichard Wallace: Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase -- there haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small -- relatively small number as a percent. It's got up quite a bit, but off of a small number. \n So absolutely, we've seen it and we see that directly tie to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and combining some of the products we have, Semi Process Control and EPC, we absolutely have seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that. \nBren Higgins: Yes, you had the overall packaging market down, what, 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are occurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: I have a question on leading-edge logic investments. At SEMICON West a couple of weeks ago, when you spoke to suppliers, there were expectations that the leading-edge spending could be up less than mature nodes into next year. \n And I assume process control intensity is higher on leading versus mature nodes. So my question to you is, are there any major product cycles or e-beam or X-ray or major contribution from areas like auto, which could help perhaps offset your exposure to leading-edge investments next year? \nRichard Wallace: Sure. I think that for KLA, the 1 thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. \n So I think that's 1 factor. And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that, less so than one who is primarily focused on capacity would be. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you very much, Chelsea, and I wanted to thank everyone again for their interest and their time. We know it's a very busy earnings season. It's also a very busy day. This was a later call in order to try to accommodate as much as we could. So we look forward to speaking to all of you in the weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for any final remarks. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the March 2023 quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market closed. All materials can be found on our IR website.\n Today's discussion is being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they are for calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and linked to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our commentary is subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets.\n Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong.\n Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth. Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical. We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter.\n Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest-growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment. \n Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where 0-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test efforts.\n As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. \n We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023. In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses. \n And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow. Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends.\n Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49, above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8% at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to effect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.\n [indiscernible] also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.\n Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million.\n As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow.\n Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar '23 from approximately $95 million in '22. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business.\n We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the U.S. government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded. Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide.\n Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply in light of demand. We expect foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.\n Our June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million; Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and Memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix.\n Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar '23 with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments.\n As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar '23, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60.\n EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares. In conclusion, after 3 years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar '23. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar '22.\n Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.\n For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.\n With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A, and then begin the Q&A? \nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: And great to see you had another year of strong share gains from the team last year. You reiterated your full year WFE outlook at down 20%. You also talked about your process control business remaining stable at the June quarter levels through the remainder of this year. I'm wondering if the stable outlook also reflects the stabilization of cancellation and pushout activity from what I assume has been a pretty volatile bookings environment over the past 6 months? \nBren Higgins: Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.\n So that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than 1, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. \nHarlan Sur: Perfect. And then on your EPC franchise, this -- it's driven pretty strong growth, right, 10% to 11% CAGR over the past 3 years, that's including Services. It even grew 7% last year, right, in a slower consumer environment. Coming into this year, though, you guys are already driving an EPC systems profile of down about 20% year-over-year. Do you still anticipate the EPC business to grow this to outperform WFE growth? And sort of at a high level, how are you thinking about EPC profile second half versus first half? \nBren Higgins: Yes. It's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half. And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.\n But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses. SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year.\n It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. \nOperator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, surprised you haven't changed your foundry WFE outlook for 2023 at all. Many of your peers discussed modest adjustments there. So would love to hear your thoughts as to what's offsetting that? And as part of that, can you speak to the lead times for optical inspection, which I still think are well beyond 12 months? So is that the kind of the key to the story for KLA where you're finding this sustainable level at the June level in the second half? \nBren Higgins: Yes, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. \nChristopher Muse: Great. And then maybe just to follow up on the legacy part. You talked about native China being 25% of process control. How much of that is silicon wafer versus just traditional front-end equipment? \nBren Higgins: So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing [indiscernible] on optical inspection. You asked about lead times of our -- on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question. So lead times are -- on optical inspection are still pretty long.\n There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in and down, WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year given those dynamics. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: I'm curious what's giving you the confidence that sales have bottomed when many of your memory customers still appear to have a lot of inventory and are unclear when the utilization will pick up. So specifically, how is your visibility to the memory demand for the back half of this calendar year? Do you think it will be about this level, it'll be lower, above this level?\n Because I noticed that in June, the implied memory sales seem to be picking up, albeit of small numbers. So just any comments on how you're thinking about memory demand recovery from here as it pertains to what you think about utilization at your key memory customers. \nBren Higgins: Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, sort of the 23% that we talked about in June and -- even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations.\n And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend. We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology. So even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And from my follow-up, I realize it's early, but I thought that given that you have long lead times and you are engaged in the technology side with many customers, you probably have a decent view of how the calendar '24 might look like. So I'm not asking for numerical guidance, but what's your gut right now that is WFE likely to grow next year? Is it supposed to be flat or down? Like what could be, just the kind of qualitative puts and takes as we start thinking about WFE next year? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part. And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. \n And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year. So if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar '24, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: The first one, Rick or Bren, you spoke about resuming some shipments to China. Can you quantify in terms of millions of dollars, how much that you're going to expect to recoup in the second half? And is that baked into your view that revenue will stay around these levels into the calendar second half? And along the same path, this China shipment assumption is tied to kind of lagging as memory, and I'm kind of curious, what exactly you mean by lagging as memory because I thought memory is always at leading edge. And then I have a follow-up. \nBren Higgins: Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall. So look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up, should we still expect your service revenues to grow this year? And how to think about the service between the Semi and the EPC portion? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. \n And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we've talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yes, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. \nBren Higgins: Yes. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some [indiscernible] capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%. As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. \n But still growth, to Rick's point. And on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Just a first of clarification. For the clarification on export restrictions that you received, that $200 million you're thinking about for the second half of this year, did that reenter your backlog or RPO this quarter? \nBren Higgins: Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we have certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin side, how should we think about inventory reserves for the rest of this year? And then can you just remind us how do we think about the timing of those reversals? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in '21 and '22 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in '21 and '22 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. \n So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply. So what I would expect, well, in this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendibility and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts.\n It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment. So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand.\n But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: I have 2 questions on China. First, is the number of customers you're engaged domestically in China on trailing edge higher this year versus last year or year before? \nRichard Wallace: I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. \nBren Higgins: I mean, I -- but yes, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. \nAtif Malik: Okay. And then on multinational companies in China, Rick, in your discussions with these companies, how are they looking at their future capacity expansions given that the license period for the export restrictions is coming due in September, October? I mean, how are they looking strategically on investments in China? \nBren Higgins: Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's -- they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there -- they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I had 2. So first, I'm just trying to tie your process control systems commentary to WFE. And it sounds like Orbotech systems -- I mean, you're not exclusively saying this in June, but it sounds kind of like they're pretty flattish. So Process Control Systems have to be about [ $1,550 million ], down maybe $175 million from March. And then in the shareholder letter, you're saying that it's going to sort of remain flat into the back half of the year at that level.\n So if I just take the [ $1,720 million ] you did in March and then I take the [ $1,550 million ] in June and I kind of flatline that, and I used $75 billion this year in WFE, that implies you're like 8.5% this year for WFE share, that's -- I mean, that's a record high. So I guess the question is, is there something structural going on that you think there's staying power to where your WFE share could stay that high? Usually, I think, 6% in the trough and 8% in the peak, but you're sort of like 8.5%? Or maybe is it that your $75 billion numbers too low? \nBren Higgins: Tim, I'm not -- we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now. In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at '23 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. \n Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest-growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us. Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point. I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers.\n And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well. So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market. \n Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has, I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms. \n And those 2 -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. \nTimothy Arcuri: And then I guess I had a question also on WFE. And some people are trying to get at this, I think. But -- so WFE is still sort of flat in the $75 billion range. I think, Bren, you said that there's $200 million for you that can shift that sort of an add-back of stuff that was banned in the past. So if you're less than 10% of WFE, that's probably like a few billion dollar add back from just from China there, and then there's all this lagging edge stuff happening in China. \n So is it that the lagging edge kind of stuff -- like it's not helping this year? It's more helping next year? I guess I'm a little surprised that the $75 billion number is not higher just given the massive increase in bookings that we're seeing from lagging edge in China? \nBren Higgins: Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one. We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right?\n We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: I want to follow up with the previous question about -- you talked about the stabilizing demand and maybe a similar profile for the rest of the year. Are you expecting your revenue for the back half of the year to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of that $200 million of recoup revenue? Or are there other factors to consider whether it's on the service business on the EPC side of things? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid-single digit given that guidance. \n And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. \nSidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is one of your largest customers in Taiwan talked about higher levels of tool reuse between the 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers. How is this factored into your second half outlook and maybe even the longer-term outlook? And do you think that's anything incremental to what the industry's current level of capacity is used between those? \nRichard Wallace: It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. \n So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So nothing really new in what we see in those statements. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I had a follow-up question to Sidney's question. Given the depth and breadth of design start activity you're seeing in the leading edge foundry space. What are your expectations for process control intensity into 2024? Is there a bias potentially to the upside from where you are in 2023? \nBren Higgins: Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows. It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. \n You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling but also more layers here moving forward. So those are all positives for us. Also depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. \n So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well. So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market as it relates to foundry/logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. \nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I think you commented specifically on China as it pertains to your business with wafer suppliers and reticle suppliers as well. But curious on a global basis, how big are those businesses today? And how should we think about sustainability over the next 12 months or so, again, on the wafer side as well as both merchant and captive reticle customers? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall wafer -- and I'm separating this way because I don't want to double count. But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. \n And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: You talked about kind of qualitatively about Services not being down this year, maybe up a little bit this year. Can you talk about the utilization impact on that? And as you see utilizations coming down in both foundry and memory, I guess I would think that has less impact on you than it does for some of the other guys. But can you just talk to how utilization might weigh on that number? \nBren Higgins: The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the Service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment. \n So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. \nJoseph Moore: That's helpful. And then separately, on China, you guys have talked to the sort of China trailing-edge logic opportunity a couple of different times here. Your sense for whether there's building ahead there -- I mean I would assume you have customers there that have anxiety about future export controls, could they be putting in capacity? I guess maybe a different way of asking the question, do you see utilization that kind of validates the requirement of the spending? Or do you worry that it could be a building ahead of supply? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. It's possible. I mean we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies. Remember, there's a very active EV market in China.\n So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. \nBlayne Curtis: I was curious, I mean, you talked about in the outlook, legacy growing faster than leading edge. Just curious if you could give us a perspective where that mix is within foundry/logic today? And maybe a perspective of where it's come from? \nBren Higgins: Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging, so to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter. And it's broad-based. And certainly, China is a pretty big factor in and all, but you also have a fair amount of revenue growth, the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these end markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge. \n And our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots. So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last 6 months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. \nBlayne Curtis: And then I wanted to ask you on the inventories on the balance sheet. I think it's a record level -- near record in data as well. So I guess kind of everybody has this phenomena going on. How are you thinking about managing that with the top line kind of flat to down? I'm kind of curious if inventories will still grow and any impact on gross margin as you work it down? \nRichard Wallace: Yes. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. \n As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them. And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of Service extendibility of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. \n So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much. That's why even in these very strong upturn environments, we've rarely gotten above -- much above 2x from an inventory term point of view. \n So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Maybe for Rick, trailing edge clearly is sort of less process control intensive. But I guess to what extent does the immaturity of these production lines, particularly in China, a lot of greenfield situations and also the desire for faster time to market, how do these factors kind of counteract that typical kind of lower intensity for trailing edge? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's 1 thing. The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have -- you get more efficiency on a large fab.\n And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result. They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. \n So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. \nBrian Chin: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of the percent of memory increasing in the June quarter -- and it looks like also on a dollar basis as well, I think you suggested it's pretty focused towards DRAM. Can you characterize the nature of that uptick? Or is this more of a kind of a classic case of coming off such lows in March that this is really more of a bouncing along a bottom kind of situation? \nRichard Wallace: Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology-centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities we get early. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Just 2 follow-ups for me. If I just take your commentary regarding the revenue trend first half and second half of the calendar, it seems to me that the peak to trough decline in revenues in the 25% to 30% range. And I'm not asking you for a guide. But what I wanted to better understand if you did close to $3 billion in December of '22 with a WFE in the $90 billion to $95 billion. Can you go and hit those revenue run rate without WFE -- if not WFE having to go to $90 billion? Does your diversification looking forward, especially with semiconductor material and others, would enable you to hit [ $3 billion ] without having WFE to go to $90 billion plus? And I have a follow-up. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things -- and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue with lower WFE levels as that sustains. Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. \n There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there. So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in 1 year. We talked a lot about 0.5 point to 1 point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. \n And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/logic in terms of overall mix of WFE, that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then just 1 quick follow-up. If any of your customers were to reuse some of the equipment, how should we think about price diagnostic content for that application? \nBren Higgins: Well, as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others. It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. \n But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities. But I am sure they will look for opportunities. If in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. \n You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So those tend to be longer-term decisions. So structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer-term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment.\n What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online. And given the design start environment at 7 and 5, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward. \nKevin Kessel: And thank you, everyone, for your time today for -- we know it's busy earnings season. I appreciate it. We'll be seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chelsea, so she can provide any final instructions. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \n And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Sir, please go ahead. \nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to our earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and our March quarter outlook. \n Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. All materials can be found on our IR website. \n Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website.\n Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\n Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. \n I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? \nRichard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023. \n Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment. \n KLA's December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges. \n Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems. \n KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022 with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. For calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate. \n Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection, are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA. Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. \n Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. \n KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation, and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. \n Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. \n To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing 3 main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D. \n Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023. \n Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long term. \n Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? \nBren Higgins: Thanks. As Rick just detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar '22 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements. \n Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks as we move through the quarter. \n Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5% due to the impact of increasing noncash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter. \n Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendibility of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter. \n Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. \n Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid.\n Looking ahead to calendar '23, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY '23 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY '22 due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. \n This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAND as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy. \n KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology roadmap investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. \n In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements; maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership; and align our operating structure with top line expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis while delivering strong relative financial performance.\n Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the '22 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter. \n For calendar '23, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million.\n For calendar '23, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, head count and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.\n Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar '23. \n Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares. \n In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after 3 strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends. \n These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. \n For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions. Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity. Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years.\n We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. \n These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? \nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please give instructions to queue for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, first question, you talked about expectations to outperform WFE again here in calendar '23. So curious, can you kind of walk through, is that a comment on total revenues? Or just process control? And within that, how should we be thinking about the benefit from backlog/deferred revenues, particularly into the March quarter? Trying to make sure I calculate that right in my model. \nBren Higgins: C.J., so I'll start, and we'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there are a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because the other industries we're in, it's less clear. But given the Semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology roadmap. So that's always a positive factor for us. \n We also see PC intensity moving up because it -- where you generally see more cycling is in memory. And so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry, that tends to be something that's good for us as well. Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical EUV, our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA. \n China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, I think they're impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022. \n In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of having those -- the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. \n The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. \n So not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to -- longer term, to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for '23. \nRichard Wallace: And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share.\n We don't see any degradation of that in '23 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think '23 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, you talked about expectations for gross margins north of 60% for the whole year, guided 61.5% for March. I guess this is kind of a 2-part question. I guess how do you see kind of a trough revenue quarter here? If you can answer that. And does that mean that we would be below 60% in the back half of calendar '23? Or you think you can stay north of 60% every quarter for the year? \nBren Higgins: Yes, I think we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year, we'll be better than that overall. \n I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So I think we'll likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph Quatrochi: I wanted to kind of double-click on your WFE expectations and then how do you think about your model. Are you thinking about first half or second half WFE being relatively balanced for the year and then within your kind of forward revenue expectations for KLA as well? \nBren Higgins: I think my statements earlier were more -- were KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yes, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. \nJoseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then just kind of maybe bigger picture. But one of your larger customers have talked about a temporary decline in the 7-nanometer utilization rates, but at the same time, also talking about working with their customers to introduce to backfill capacity, introduce new products over the next few years. I guess how do we think about that dynamic in the context of, like, your print check business and the mask shop? \nRichard Wallace: I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned.\n The other thing, and Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. \nBren Higgins: Yes. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node, most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate. \n And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Your services business last year was strong, right? It was up 15%. Historically, like this segment does not decline during downturns, right? Very stable subscription services contracts, expanding support opportunities, legacy nodes, more software attach, et cetera. But you do have a transactional part of the business, right, tied to manufacturing activity. You've got your EPC services business in there as well and the impact from China export control. So lots of puts and takes. So does the team believe it can grow services revenues this year? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to Semi process control, we've only had 1 down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.\n So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support, even if they're not investing in new capability.\n EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in services overall. \n So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about Semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid- to high single digits. And I think EPC systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side. So -- because we have had a weaker '22, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. \nRichard Wallace: And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours, because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. \nHarlan Sur: Great. I appreciate that. And strong patterning growth in 2022, I think patterning was up like 50%. Obviously, part of that is being driven by EUV, Deep EUV litho  adoption. And if you look at ASML's results, I mean that continues strong. But I think they're looking for EUV litho systems being signed off, units being signed off this year to grow, like, 40%, both for EUV and Deep EUV. So litho shipments are always sort of a good forward indicator for your business. You've got positive exposure via your wafer, your reticle inspection systems, print check, litho metrology. Is this going to be one of the -- it was clearly a bigger driver last year. Is this going to be one of the bigger drivers of the potential outperformance this year for the team? \nRichard Wallace: Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as [ data ] all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business. So it's not entirely just related to the tech. \n And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that. So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in '23. And the metrology, as it pertains to technology advancement development, will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech nodes that have a lot of challenges in those 2 areas. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: If you look at the full year WFE view of down 20%, right, in the kind of the mid $70 billion, that view -- that overall view doesn't seem to have changed in the last 3 months. But something else seems to have downshifted in the commentary from you and your peers. I'm just curious if -- Rick or Bren, if you would take a look back in the last 3 months, what has changed from an assumption perspective? Is there a certain part of the market that you are exposed to? Like, has there been any change in the last 3 months? Because the overall number doesn't seem to have changed. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had 3 months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. \nRichard Wallace: Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hadn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in '23. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, if I'm hearing you, March is perhaps not the trough quarter for the year that -- I don't know, maybe it's June or September. Any way to gauge what that kind of conceptually, the trough quarter could be? Because when I look at memory, I think it's only, what, 15% of process control in Q1. Is that the trough for memory? Or can it get even lower than that? \nBren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There are some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in -- I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Maybe just to double back on the performance obligations. It sounds like -- I could be a little bit off here. But in terms of 12 months RPOs, maybe it's -- maybe ended the December quarter, kind of a $6 billion-ish kind of level. Is that about right? And is there a point in terms of as you draw that down a little bit maybe over the next few to several quarters, is there a point in the year you can kind of point to where you think that number will stabilize? \nBren Higgins: So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments. \n I think as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well. But I don't expect to see -- I think it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think it'll level off as we move forward over the course of the year. But look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. \nBrian Chin: Okay. That's fair. And this is probably just digging into a question that was recently asked. But I mean, I think the math might suggest that in the March quarter, the memory system revenue could be something like $250 million, maybe $250 million to $300 million. Maybe that's not trough, but it seems pretty low comparable to recent periods and going back a little ways. And so maybe not trough, but not too far off. Is that kind of an unfair conclusion? \nBren Higgins: I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly, as a percent of the total, as low as it's been for some time. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: The revenue decline in the March quarter is a little more severe than we kind of expected. I guess, we had thought the revenue is relatively stable, especially given the large backlog you had going into the quarter. Is it just that you were able to pull in some of the revenues into the December quarter? Or was it my assumption that revenue could be stable in the near term was incorrect? \nBren Higgins: Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the\u2026 \nOperator: It seems we have lost speaker connection. Please hold, Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty. \n [Technical Difficulty] \nKevin Kessel: Sorry, we got cut out there. I know it's in the middle of Bren's answer to Sidney. \nBren Higgins: So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter. \n As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we needed, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools. \n Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the 2 quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is, is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them, and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. \nSidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. Can I ask a second question? You talked about expecting operating expenses to come down throughout the year. What is a good level to think about exiting this calendar year? Talk about maybe what are the areas you see more -- you'll see more of the cuts. And are there any of the actions impacting the gross margin positively as well? \nBren Higgins: Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time. \n It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and $105 billion or more into '23, so $100 billion in '22. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels. \n But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for top line, somewhere in that, I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.\n And depending on how we see the top line evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at '24 and size '24, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: Sorry. Can you hear me? \nKevin Kessel: Yes, we can hear you. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, we can hear you. \nAtif Malik: All right. So I have a question on the memory investments. Are you expecting memory CapEx reduction to be broad this year? Or just 1 or 2 memory makers? \nRichard Wallace: I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. And look, it'll vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So when we look at it, I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. \nAtif Malik: Got it. And then on China WFE, are you expecting China WFE to be down as much as overall WFE? And what's holding China WFE? Is it the trailing edge investments? And what's driving higher investments on the trailing edge? Is it also end market or maybe higher process control intensity? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about '23 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.\n So when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: There was a question before about EUV, and I'm wondering if you can sort of help give a number in terms of how much of your revenue attaches directly to EUV. There's not a ton of inspection in the litho cell, but you certainly get pulled along with anything that helps sort of horizontal scaling, so. And obviously, EUV does that. So I'm kind of wondering if you can handicap how much of your revenue gets carried along with EUV, and then I had a follow-up. \nRichard Wallace: Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is -- that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. \n So I would say part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're -- overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5, in particular, work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it. Bren? \nBren Higgins: I think that's good. \nTimothy Arcuri: Awesome, Rick. Super helpful. Bren, I had a question for you on process control systems. It seems like the guidance -- well, actually, it's a 2-part question. It seems like the March guidance implies something in the 16.5% range for process control segment -- systems. So I wanted you to confirm that, first of all. \n And then the real question is the timing of when the process control systems bottoms. Because Lam's bottoming in March, but it seems like if I take low to mid-70s WFE, I assume you don't lose much WFE share. It's kind of hard to see the number not bottoming until you get to 1.1 roughly and you're still at 1.6. So can you sort of answer those for me? \nBren Higgins: Yes. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces.\n The drop-off that you -- and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, my first question is, just to play the devil's advocate. Last quarter, you said the process control argument was site-to-tech roadmap and transition and not as much as to capacity, i.e., less technical. But then, it seems like process control is not immune to the cyclicality. So I'm just kind of curious, like, are these just, like, regular cyclical issue? Is process control actually really driven by tech and not capacity purchases? And long lead time inspection doesn't matter anymore? I'm just kind of curious. Or do you think we get back to trend line in a couple of quarters? Any color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-on. \nRichard Wallace: Yes. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity, but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transition. So I think you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those 2. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline. \n So I think we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly, a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while because the DRAM guys, memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity, as in none, they're still driving technology transitions. And we know there are multiple players now in logic trying to move forward on that. \n So I'd say it's a balanced approach, which is why we think we'll outperform this year, but not -- we're not going to hold flat relative to that because we definitely had some capacity components. So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. \nBren Higgins: Yes, Krish, we did share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by, not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows, that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as [ there's ] a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. \n So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Super helpful. And as a quick follow-up, Intel just said a while ago, they extended their depreciation from 5 to 8 years. I'm just kind of curious if that -- does that mean that extending the useful life of semi-cap equipment from 5 to 8 years? And what does that mean for semi -- for process control tools? If you can extend the use of the equipment, does it mean that less purchasing over the longer term? \nRichard Wallace: So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect. \n I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in a long-term view based on that decision by one customer. \nBren Higgins: And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for, not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. \n So I think it's a reflection of, at least, to Rick's point in how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector, not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. \nKevin Kessel: Chelsea, I believe we're coming close to the bottom of the hour, top of the hour. We probably have time for one more question. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I just had a couple of housekeeping questions, if that's okay. The China impact, the export restriction impact in the December quarter and what you're assuming for calendar '23, Bren, sorry if I missed this, but if you can remind us how big the impact could be -- or was in Q4 and how... \nBren Higgins: Yes. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of its impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. \nToshiya Hari: Got it. And then on DRAM versus NAND, I think when you were going through the WFE assumption, you mentioned your expectation for DRAM to be down more than NAND. But when you think about your own business, KLA's business, I would expect DRAM to be a little bit more resilient given EUV adoption insertion and the benefits there. Is that the right way to think about your business in calendar '23 on a relative basis? \nBren Higgins: Yes. Yes. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAND as a percent. Yes. \nKevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We know it's a really busy day of earnings. We also apologize for the technical difficulties we had during the call, but we will be catching up with all of you here afterwards. So I appreciate the interest and speak soon. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation December 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day."

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions. Until that time, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. At the request of The Greenbrier Companies, this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts, Vice President, and Treasurer. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.\nJustin Roberts: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Lorie Tekorius, Greenbrier's CEO and President; Brian Comstock, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial and Leasing Officer; and Adrian Downes, Senior Vice President, and CFO. Following our update on Greenbrier's performance in 2023 and our outlook for fiscal 2024, we will open up the call for questions. In addition to the press release issued this morning, additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the IR section of our website. Matters discussed on today's conference call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Throughout our discussion today, we will describe some of the important factors that could cause Greenbrier's actual results in 2024 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Greenbrier. And with that I'll hand the call over to Lorie. Good morning.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe that we're nearly two months into our fiscal 2024, which we entered with significant momentum after a transitional period in 2023. I'm going to underscore several accomplishments beyond our strong financial performance, including record annual revenue. Execution of several key financial targets in 2023 was aided by the multi-year strategy we presented at our inaugural Investor Day in April. Internally, we've named our multi-year strategy Better Together. The plan sets three fundamental priorities. First is maintaining our manufacturing leadership position across geographies. Second, we will meet our customers' needs as we optimize our industrial footprint for efficiency and margin enhancement. And third, and of equal importance, we will grow at scale in leasing and services to reduce the impact of manufacturing cyclicality on our overall enterprise. As part of our footprint optimization, we analyzed our global production capacity. And the outcome of the analysis resulted in the sale of our Gunderson Marine operation and a small foundry in Texas, as well as our exit from a manufacturing joint venture in Turkey. Further, we acquired the minority stake of our leasing joint venture partner in North America to take full ownership of our lease fleet. Underlying these actions and others is our fundamental approach to make Green Bear simpler and more profitable. And we're extremely pleased with our accomplishments and strategic progress in fiscal 2023, but we're really never fully satisfied. And in some cases, we're ahead of our internal schedules, and others, we're laying the foundation to execute the plan. The recap of our results comes with a caveat. We don't expect our progress to be linear, and our goals target a five-year completion window. So now turning to our results. First, I have to commend our commercial team for their outstanding performance throughout fiscal 2023, and particularly this past quarter. In the face of muted demand for intermodal units, the breadth of our product offerings and our strong business origination abilities resulted in a very high share of North American railcar orders the last few quarters, culminating in a 40% share of the industry backlog as of June 30. This provides us with excellent visibility and confidence that we're on the right track. For the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of a billion dollars, unchanged from the prior quarter. As revenue remained durable, aggregate gross margins expanded to 12.5% from 12.3% in the third quarter. For the full year, aggregate gross margin was 11.2%, which is a 50 basis point improvement from the trailing 12-month aggregate gross margin as of our investor day when we established a mid-teens aggregate gross margin target by fiscal 2026. Fourth quarter manufacturing gross margin of 9.3% was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter. However, there was positive movement behind the static percentage. The negative margin impact of a strengthening peso was partially offset by achieving certain manufacturing footprint efficiencies. As I mentioned earlier, the evaluation of our manufacturing footprint resulted in the sale of Gunderson Marine and our Texas Boundary, bringing approximately $20 million of permanent annual savings as we step into the next fiscal year. Greenbrier's flexible manufacturing footprint allows us to create value and generate returns while solving our customers' problems. For example, we recently adapted production lines for new railcars to accommodate large railcar refurbishment programs for multiple customers in North America. And similar to the railcar conversions we've previously discussed, this business activity is accretive to earnings but is not included in new railcar deliveries. Railcar refurbishments and conversions allow customers to extend the life of their railcar fleet while improving the overall operating efficiency of the North American fleet. Additionally, this work benefits the environment through the reuse or recycling of components like wheels, axles, and brakes and significantly reduce steel consumption. For example, stretch conversions use approximately 65% less steel than newly built railcars with similar dimensions. Our in-sourcing initiative also occupies line space previously dedicated to new railcar production. The first phase of bringing fabrication in-house for basic primary parts and sub-assemblies as part of our make versus buy strategy was completed in the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve our full cost savings targets of $50 million to $55 million from this initiative in fiscal 2025. And moving across the business, maintenance services continued its positive momentum even though wheel volumes declined compared to the prior quarter due to seasonality. And while revenue and maintenance services decreased by about 23%, gross margin increased by 430 basis points resulting in earnings from operations that fully offset the reduced revenue. This was accomplished through improved pricing and the impact of the operating efficiencies we've been driving over the last two years in this business. And now as Brian will explain shortly, we have a solid foundation in place for expanded leasing strategy and are advancing it thoughtfully. This is a critical component of our multi-year plan and is expected to result in the doubling of recurring revenue within the next five years. The market conditions for railcar leasing remain very positive and we're in a great position to execute our plan. Returning capital to shareholders is integral to our approach to capital allocation. I'm pleased to report that our board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share last week. And you may recall that the dividend increased 11% in Q3. Our dividend has doubled since its reinstatement in 2014 and the Q4 dividend represents Greenbrier's 38th consecutive quarterly dividend. We also repurchased shares during June at attractive levels. For the full year, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $57 million at an average price of approximately $29 per share. And the broader economy is dynamic and geopolitical strife again commands our attention and our concern. However, our outlook remains positive. We expect North America and Europe to continue to see strong demand across railcar types underpinning both new bills and lease renewals. We have excellent near-term visibility for fiscal 2024 and are focused on maximizing our platform's potential as we progress towards our multi-year targets. We're confident in the long-term strategy we presented at the investor day because it's focused on the things we can control and not reliant on an overly optimistic demand scenario. I and the rest of the team look forward to sharing our progress on future calls. And now I'll turn it over to Brian who will elaborate on railcar demand and our leasing activity.\nBrian Comstock: Thank you Lori. In Q4, Greenbrier secured new railcar orders of 15,300 units worth nearly $1.9 billion, marking a strong end to the year. Orders continue to be broad-based and diverse across most railcar types except for intermodal where market conditions have been soft. As of August 31, Greenbrier's global backlog was 30,900 units valued at $3.8 billion, our highest backlog value in nearly eight years. Our commercial performance reflects our leading market position, strong lease origination capabilities, and direct sale experience. Despite fears of recession and slowing traffic volumes, particularly in intermodal, we maintain a healthy backlog and robust deal pipeline, largely due to our diverse portfolio of railcar designs. Our ability to originate and syndicate leases has also contributed meaningfully to our strong position in the market. Notably, international orders accounted for nearly 20% of the activity in the quarter. These orders came as we launched our leasing and syndication business in Europe. We successfully completed our first syndications in Europe, opening a new channel to the market. We're excited about our opportunity in Europe where the rail industry enjoys strong secular tailwinds as we discussed during our investor day. Likewise, we are pleased with the performance of leasing and management services in the quarter. Our lease rates on renewals continue to increase by double digits, and we are extending lease terms while maintaining a high fleet utilization. The market for leasing railcars continues to be strong, with tight railcar supply and high fleet utilization among lessors. Lease rates continue to be compensatory considering rising interest rates, which translates into higher lease rates on new originations and renewals. Regarding the underlying leases, the durations are staggered to mitigate the impact of cyclicality and create upside potential through favorable renewals. As we described during investor day, we intend to grow our fleet more steadily over the coming years and have committed to invest up to $300 million per year for each of the next five years. In 2023, we invested over $240 million on a net basis into our fleet after including asset sales from the fleet. As we shared in our press release this morning, we anticipate a gross investment of $335 million, which includes capital expenditures and transfers of railcars produced onto the balance sheet in 2023. As part of our regular fleet optimization, we expect to generate proceeds of about $80 million from asset sales. We remain focused on railcar types that will maintain a balanced fleet profile and reduce concentration risk. I want to emphasize that we will only invest in the right assets with the right lease terms and counter parties. We are steadily progressing towards our stated goal of doubling recurring revenue from leasing and maintenance services. As of the end of fiscal year, our recurring revenue was about $125 million, which is a 10% increase from our investor day when we first shared our target. Recurring revenue is growing from various sources, including new railcars added to our lease fleet, lease extensions at more favorable terms, and growth in the income of the management of third-party railcars. We continue to fix rates on our non-recourse leasing debt, and our average interest rate of 4.2% is significantly lower than current market interest rates. Given ongoing interest rate instability, we are regularly evaluating our financing strategies as we grow our lease fleet. At the end of Q4, our fleet leverage was 78% , in line with our targeted fleet leverage framework. As a reminder, railcars on the balance sheet are shown at net book value, while we leverage at an appraised fair market value. This results in leverage ratios appearing to be higher than they are in reality. In fiscal 2023, our capital markets team syndicated 4,200 railcars, generating strong liquidity and margins. This includes 900 railcars syndicated in the quarter, a modest increase from Q3. This market remains liquid with a strong appetite for this asset class, and our team is preparing for another busy year in 2024. We expect railcar deliveries to be around industry replacement levels for the next few years, with retirements keeping pace and driving better overall fleet utilization. We are confident we have the right strategy in place to execute against this backdrop. Entering the new fiscal year, we remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing capabilities and growing the leasing and management business. With that said, I'll hand the call over to Adrian, who will speak to the financial highlights in the quarter and here.\nAdrian Downes: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, quarterly and full-year financial information is available in the press release and supplemental slides on our website. Greenbrier Q4 performance continued to the momentum from the third quarter, with improved aggregate gross margin percent and higher operating margin. Following some highlights from the quarter and full year, I will also provide a general overview of our fiscal 2024 guidance. Notable highlights for the fourth quarter include new railcar orders of 15,300 units, valued at $1.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 2.2 times, highest in many years. Third quarter, third consecutive quarter, with revenues $1 billion or higher, primarily driven by the continued strength in our manufacturing segment and solid performance in our other business units. Aggregate gross margins of 12.5% reflect sequential margin enhancement from improved operating efficiencies as a result of stronger pricing and profitability in wheel sets and components at maintenance services. We also estimate the peso strengthening in the quarter negatively impacted manufacturing gross margin by 100 basis points. Selling and administrative expense of approximately $60 million is lower sequentially reflecting a reduction to employee-related costs attributable to lower incentive compensation and consulting expenses. Quarterly tax rate of 30.9% was higher than the third quarter due to the mix of foreign and domestic pre-tax earnings and discrete items. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $30 million generated diluted EPS of $0.92 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $97 million or 9.5% of revenue. Notable highlights for the full year include deliveries of 26,000 units and increase of over 30% from the prior year. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $99 million are $2.97 per diluted share on record revenue of $3.9 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase of over 110%. Adjusted EBITDA was $340 million or 8.6% of revenue and compared to fiscal year 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased by 47%. We had solid operating cash flow of $71 million. Shifting our focus to liquidity, Greenbrier generated $70 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter due to strong operating momentum. Full year results of over $71 million represents the first year since 2020 that operating cash flow ended the year positive. This was primarily due to an increase in net earnings and more efficient working capital usage. Greenbrier's Q4 liquidity remained solid at $646 million consisting of cash of $282 million and available borrowings of $364 million. Throughout fiscal year 2023, there were a number of strategic steps we undertook as part of our disciplined approach to capital deployment and announced at our inaugural investor day in April. The first was maintaining a strong balance sheet with healthy liquidity and structuring our debts to align with the business. During the year ended, August 31, 2023, we repaid the North American credit facility borrowing of $160 million. We drew down the remaining $75 million on our leasing term loan facility and we upsized our non-recourse leasing debt warehouse in June from $350 million to $550 million. We continued to mitigate risk by fixing interest rates on our non-recourse debt positioning us to continue investing in our long-term lease slate and to drive through cycle earnings. Another integral part of this strategy is our commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the course of the year, we repurchased $1.9 million shares to stock for $57 million, leaving $46 million remaining of the authorization under our current share repurchase program, which extends through January of 2025. As highlighted by Lori, on October 18, Greenbrier's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.30 per share. Based on yesterday's closing price, our annual dividend represents a dividend yield of approximately 2.9%. Throughout the year, we\u2019ve returned $36 million to shareholders through dividends and since reinstating the dividend in 2014, Greenbrier has returned over $488 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our board and management team remain committed to a balanced deployment of capital designed to create long-term shareholder value. As we look to fiscal 2024, our outlook remains positive. Forecasted liquidity levels are expected to increase from improvements and operating results and from working capital efficiencies. In turn into our fiscal year 2024 guidance, based on current business trends and production schedules, our outlook reflects the following. Deliveries of 22,500 to 25,000 units, which includes approximately 1,000 units from Greenbrier-Maxion and Brazil . We have devoted a portion of our flexible manufacturing footprint to large railcar refurbishment programs for multiple customers that are recreated to earnings but are not included in new railcar deliveries. Additionally, our insourcing initiative utilizes space previously used for new railcar production capacity. Revenues between $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, selling and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $220 million to $230 million, gross investment of approximately $335 million in leasing and management services, which includes capital expenditures, and transfers of railcars produced onto the balance sheet during 2023 [enter the lease fleets]. Capital expenditures of $190 million in manufacturing and $15 million in maintenance services. Proceeds of equipment sales are expected to be approximately $80 million. We expect full-year consolidated gross margin to increase to the low teens. And taking all of this together, we expect to grow earnings this year from fiscal 2023. We're encouraged by robust backlog, the largest value in almost eight years, which provides us with strong visibility and stability over the coming years. Supported by a talented management team that has experienced with a demonstrated track record of success, we're excited about fiscal 2024 as we continue to execute our strategic plan. Because of the strength and flexibility of our employees and business model, we are better together and continue to be well positioned to drive shareholder value in 2024. And now we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start with a question on manufacturing margins. It was helpful to get the impact from the peso in the quarter, but I was wondering if you could help us think through the cadence of manufacturing margins going forward as we move into fiscal '24. And then maybe you could address the Eagle Pass disruption that we saw in September and what type of impact that might have?\nBrian Comstock: Yes. So good morning, Justin. I think I will get started with the margins and then we can kind of speak to the impact of Eagle Pass. We would expect based on our current backlog production schedules, all the usual caveats that we would expect to see margin expansion in manufacturing kind of in Q1 and into kind of intermittently throughout the year. So I think the way to think about this is we do see expansion in Q1, but then also given the volatility of some of our production timing when cars are going onto the balance sheet. Overall, we do see expansion throughout the full year compared to fiscal 2023, but it's not going to be a stair step progression, if that makes sense.\nJustin Long: Got it. That made sense. And on the Eagle Pass component? \nAdrian Downes: Yes.\nLorie Tekorius: And I would say, yes, the Eagle Pass situation is something that we're watching very closely. We're very engaged at our various facilities as we're making certain that we're getting the inbound material that we need to produce railcars as well as outbound. We have been working very closely with the rail roads that service our facilities and at this point in time, we have not had significant disruptions or issues in getting railcars picked up from our facilities or getting them across the border. That being said, we are not resting on our laurels. Every day we're coming up with different ways that we can think about how we might mitigate any sort of disruption that we might encounter, including, whether it's different border crossings or different ways to move railcars into the United States.\nJustin Long: Okay, that's helpful. And then second question, I wanted to touch on the revenue guidance. I think it was a bit surprising to see the pressure that you're anticipating in fiscal '24. I think it's about 10% at the midpoint on a year-over-year basis, just given the recent order flow. So can you provide a little bit more color on why you expect to see the delivery pressure? I know you're reallocating some capacity for refurbishments, etc. But is there any opportunity to maybe produce at a level that's above this guidance you've provided? And when you take a step back and look at street estimates that have kind of been hovering in that [370] range for this year for EPS, is that something that seems reasonable when you balance the revenue pressure with the margin expansion you're forecasting?\nLorie Tekorius: That was a lot, Justin. Thank you. So we did think long and hard as we were giving our guidance around deliveries and revenue, acknowledging that there might be a little bit of a, swallowing hard on what's going on. We are -- we and others in this space are being very disciplined about how we think about production, not just dialing up production so that we can put a big flash number out there and then see 12 or 18 months from now production needing to be dialed back. I think that the industry is responding in a very disciplined way. I think the fact that we're dedicating some of our new car space into some of these other activities, this large program work, which is critical in our industry, particularly in the North American market, allows us to keep lines running as opposed to, again, ramping up it's going to be a creative to earnings, but it doesn't show up in the delivery numbers and the revenue associated with that activity is going to be less. So when everyone likes to go through their process of taking manufacturing revenues and just dividing it by deliveries, you're going to probably start to see some headwinds to the ASP and I would liken it to back when there used to be more intermodal activity going on. Intermodal cars have a lower ASP, which was kind of that gets to that mix shift. I would hope that as we continue to present the activities that we're doing, you and our shareholders will see that we're looking at our footprints and where we've made investments in our facilities and our operations and we're making certain to deploy those in ways that are generating a good return.\nAdrian Downes: And the one thing I would add, Justin, I think before your follow up question is even at these revenue guidance numbers, it still is our second highest level of revenue ever. So not every year can be a record, not every year can be record deliveries, but this is still very strong activity, especially when you look at our past several, our overall history. And then I think you did have a question around consensus estimates. And I don't know if you want to take that, Lori, or I don't know, I don't know.\nLorie Tekorius: You go right ahead, Justin, and I'll. \nBrian Comstock: So I think based on what we see, we do not have any heartburn around the consensus EPS number at this point. \nJustin Long: Thanks. I know that was a loaded question. Appreciate the time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Back to the delivery schedule. Can you talk about how much open space you have on your North American lines for this year still if orders were to be placed near term?\nBrian Comstock: Yes, Bascome, this is Brian Comstock. We're looking at less than 10% of our capacity is available for the fiscal year.\nBascome Majors: So any major orders are really going to go into fiscal '25 visibility now. Can you talk about how much visibility you have into the fiscal '25 plan right now, whether it be thousands of cars, a percent of capacity, any way you want to frame it?\nBrian Comstock: Yes, I think if you look at our total backlog of roughly 31,000 cars and then calculate what we're anticipating to deliver, it gives you a pretty good idea of what we're looking at today. The pipeline continues to be very strong despite some of the other rhetoric about recession. The recession really is around intermodal. If you think about it in some of the truckload conversions in box cars, but the other units are very strong. So we have really good visibility at the end of 2025 at this point.\nLorie Tekorius: Yes, and I would say I'm speaking to intermodal. I think to me, while right now there's not a lot of demand for intermodal and our delivery guidance doesn't include any intermodal activity, I think that could be a bright spot if as consumer activity shifts from services more back to goods, there might be a bright spot of a need for intermodal equipment.\nBrian Comstock: Yes, I think the other thing we're pointing out, and it kind of goes a little bit to Justin Long's question and yours, Bascome, is when you think about our delivery, about 15% of our capacity is now dedicated to sustainable conversions and or other large programs, which to Lorie's point do have a lower ASP, but they typically have a higher margin associated. So maybe that might be helpful as you guys think it through.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. And maybe just to call back to Justin's question one more time. I mean, it seems like you've been kind of flirting with this dollar per quarter run rate of earnings pretty closely for the last few quarters. And certainly you've been demonstrated in a much stronger margin market that you can do that consistently in a better part of the cycle, although this is a very different cycle than that one. We write to think that that's on the horizon as your production rate gets stable and your margins get to where you think they can be sustainably. And some of this your rationalization is behind you versus in front of you; just trying to understand what the underlying P&L of the business can look like when you get the business to where you want it to be. Thank you.\nLorie Tekorius: Sure, Bascome. Thank you. And I do think that that is achievable right now. One of the things that maybe we haven't highlighted as consistently is as we're building our own fleet. That means that we're taking some of the production that would typically be sold or syndicated and keeping it on our balance sheet. And it takes a little time for the earnings associated with that recurring revenue to build up to offset that immediate recognition of margin right away. So I absolutely see as we are continuing to focus on efficiency in our operating activities, so manufacturing as well as our maintenance services and aftermarket parts, I see that revenue and margin build when it comes to leasing. So I would be great if we could just kind of say, yes, dollar a quarter. And then where do we go? \nBascome Majors: Thank you all for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nKen Hoexter: Hey, Lorie and team. Good morning. Just to clarify, Lorie, that last answer there. So if you're, it looks like you're getting more external orders, right? Or if I'm understanding you, right? So does that mean we get more real time revenue recognition in terms of that, that eliminating maybe some of the lumpy delivery surprises because you get that as you build more for external or is that not what you're suggesting?\nLorie Tekorius: No, what I'm suggesting is so we have, so if you think about it, someone needs a rail car. They may want to buy it. That's great. We're happy to build a rail car and sell it straight out. Oftentimes, we have folks who don't want to buy a car. They want to lease the car. We have very strong lease origination capabilities to the extent that we are building our owned lease fleet to create this recurring revenue cash flow, tax-advantaged cash flow stream, predictable revenue. We're keeping some of those on our balance sheet, meaning over time, as we grow our portfolio, you are going to have more of this recurring revenue and stable earnings. In the short term, that means that some of the immediate satisfaction you might get through the P&L by selling the car or syndicating them, that's going to get deferred.\nKen Hoexter: Yes, so no change. It's not like this new order is changing that. It's just this is the whole concept of adding the leasing just creates that more stability. I thought there was a message you were maybe getting some more orders which would have stalled some of this syndication?\nLorie Tekorius: No, yes. \nKen Hoexter: Yes, Go ahead. \nLorie Tekorius: No, I was just going to say we are keeping more of what we originate on our balance sheet than we would have historically. \nKen Hoexter: And then I just want to revisit, I guess, Justin and Bascome's questions on the delivery to understand. I know you said you've got maybe 10% left and available, but yet this number being down is, Lorie, is that you being conservative in terms of that built potential? Is there a potential where you create more spaces through an intermodal potential there? I just want to understand, obviously, the stock is taking a hit today given you had this great order number a month or so ago, and now it seems like we're constrained on that build in that fiscal '24 outlook. I just want to understand the messaging just seems a little odd, if you can help me understand that a bit. \nLorie Tekorius: Sure, and I guess what I would say is we're trying to highlight the fact that some of our new car production space is being consumed. I think Brian indicated about 15% of our space is being consumed by activity that does not show up in just a delivery statistic. We can think about how we do a different job to identify how much of what's the revenue or the margin potential on that activity. But I would say that the OEMs in the North American space are being a bit more disciplined as opposed to just trying to crank the dial up to juice out a bunch of deliveries in a particular period. But we're thinking about the longer term and when our customers need the rail cars and what's that right steady pace of producing cars. So as we look at our footprint and make certain that we are utilizing the investments that we've made in that footprint to generate return, it is not as easy as in the past where it was just look at deliveries and convert it to revenue. There's other activity going on.\nAdrian Downes: And the one thing I would add, Ken is that I mean this is part of our DNA is solving our customers problems and our customers don't always need a new rail car. Sometimes they need a large number of cars refurbished, converted, and this is where we step in and we work with our long-term core customers and take care of it from that perspective versus just trying to jam new cars down their throat. \nKen Hoexter: Yes, that makes complete sense. So maybe there's a new statistic. I don't know whether you kind of give like, hey, that thousand car potential turns into X number of remods or something that that can I guess somehow fill that revenue void or understanding that future revenue potential void.\nLorie Tekorius: Great [statistics], Ken.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Yes, no. My last one, sorry, I'm just going to squeeze another one in quickly. But international, is there some discussion I know in the release you talked about what was being done now Brazil and included in the number of your outlook? Is there maybe an international versus domestic mix or in the backlog you can talk to?\nBrian Comstock: I would say that our international activity is relatively stable. Our Brazil activity has been historically included in our deliveries and backlog but overall it's about 20% of orders in the most recent quarter, about 20-ish percent I think in backlog and it is predominantly weighted towards European activity because it is much larger there and there is more just overall activity going on versus Brazil but Brazil continues to be a very profitable operation for us just on a smaller scale. And we call out Brazil separately. It is small but we account for Brazil. We don't consolidate it so it flows through the equity method of accounting. We do include the deliveries and backlog but it doesn't flow through our revenue line over time which is why we've historically called that out separately. It's not because it's changing that we're calling it out this quarter.\nLorie Tekorius: And then maybe the one last thing I would jump in on when it comes to international is we are getting some nice traction in Europe on originating leases. So this is where in the European market we are taking those commercial capabilities that we have to originate at least working directly with the shipper. The difference for now is that we're not holding those railcars on our balance sheet but we are syndicating them through to a syndication partner but it does give us more control of our production levels, our production schedule and puts us right in touch with our customer which has served us well in the North American market. \nKen Hoexter: Great thanks Lorie, Justin, Adrian and Brian appreciate the thoughts. \nAdrian Downes: Thanks Ken. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nRyan Deveikis: Good morning, this is Ryan Devakas on for Allison. Just I guess asked in another way, I mean you guys used to provide some level of detail on railcar refurbishments. I think last quarter it was 1,000 railcar units at 85 million. Is there any, like, can you record, well, I guess what I'm trying to say is, can you give that level of detail now, and then, like, let's baked into the fiscal '24 guidance?\nAdrian Downes: I think part of it is that the, what we used to provide were explicitly a very narrow definition conversions, and what we've seen is that our production space is actually being utilized by more than just that narrow definition, and so we're not necessarily disclosing that because it's a little fungible because not all work is the same. And part of it is, I think we're seeing north of 2,000 cars are included in our manufacturing facilities for this refurbishment and conversion work in fiscal '24.\nBrian Comstock: Yes, this is Brian, Ryan, and maybe back to Ken's question a little bit, too. I think if you take the number that I had kind of given, which is 12% to 15% of our production is a sustainable conversions and or some form of modification, and you look at our delivery guidance, I think you'd come up with a pretty good idea of what we're anticipating to build or put into that grouping.\nRyan Deveikis: Thank you. And then, I guess one last one, CN mentioned last night they're starting to boot Lithium for EVs. First, was kind of wondering what kind of car height that perhaps goes in, or if you guys have seen any inquiries or level orders that are servicing this market at this point?\nAdrian Downes: Yes, it's a good question, Ryan. I can't speak too much for under several NDAs, but I can tell you that there is opportunity in the marketplace for moving Lithium batteries as the EV market ramps up.\nRyan Deveikis: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Sorry, I missed some of the opening comments, but, Lori, early last year you talked about evaluating where you had value tied up on the balance sheet and a goal of driving better returns or exiting those assets. Did you talk about that already, or can you update us on the evaluation process and what the action plan is?\nLorie Tekorius: Sure, Steve. So, yes, and this is not a process that is not over yet, but the places that we have executed on in fiscal 2023 is we sold the Gunderson Marine operation that's here in Portland, Oregon, so that concluded in May, I believe, and then we also sold a small foundry that was part of the ARI acquisition foundries located in Texas. We sold that in August. We also exited a joint venture that we had in Turkey where we were manufacturing some components to go into our Polish and Romanian operations. We exited that joint venture in August, and then all the way back to, I think it was January, which at some points in time, I feel like this has been the never-ending year, but all the way back to January, we acquired the minority interest in our GBX leasing lease fleet so that now that's wholly owned. And in my prepared remarks, we spoke to the fact that exiting some of those businesses should give us annual savings of about $20 million on a go-forward basis.\nSteve Barger: That's great. Thank you for that recap. And do you feel like there's more on the balance sheet that can go through that fix or exit process, and can you frame that or size it?\nLorie Tekorius: I would say that we're constantly looking at it, which is where this conversation was going on with Ryan around how we're utilizing our manufacturing footprint here in North America and saying, we've got this excise footprint that has been dedicated to primarily new railcar production. What are the needs of our customers in North America? And to the extent that they have large refurbishment program needs or re-qualifications, if we can utilize those investments in a manufacturing facility to be able to serve our customer and do it in a way that drops through accretively to the bottom line, that's what we'll do. We've got that opportunity in Europe to also look at how we're utilizing our footprint there. We probably have, I think we have five facilities in Europe. And if we can get the right workforce in the right area, I think that we could increase our production throughput in those facilities. So that's, again what we're looking at is how do we optimize the investments that we've made.\nSteve Barger: Yes, that's great. And of course, the reason I ask is last year was a record revenue year, but free cash flow after net investment was a negative number for the third year in a row. First, path through the assumptions this year looks like it could be another low or negative free cash flow year. So just trying, can you talk about that specifically and how you prioritize or how you view cash generation in FY24?\nLorie Tekorius: So and I'm not looking at all of those specific numbers, so Justin will realign if I step off in the wrong direction, but you're absolutely right when it comes to our operating facilities looking at, looking long and hard at where we're making investments to make certain that where those investments are generating the kind of return. And sometimes it might take more than just a particular 12 months to get that sort of return or benefit. The other side of this is we are growing our lease fleet. So that means that there are cars that we have originated the transaction on the leasing transaction and we're choosing because of the quality of that transaction to hold that on our balance sheet. And that is allowing us to grow a very diverse portfolio of railcars that we're holding. It's about $13,600 at the end of August and different take, $200. But it's, it's a diverse car type. It's diverse commodities that are being carried. It's diverse terms. It's diverse lessees, but that is consuming cash that is not being converted into, it's not being monetized as we would have historically done it.\nAdrian Downes: And Steve, one thing I would add onto that is as you look at our leasing investment activity, bear in mind that that's levered around 75%. So it's not just $335 million out the door. It's a much smaller piece of that is kind of our investment on that. What I would say from a capital deployment perspective is investing in leasing, investing in our make versus buy strategy and North American manufacturing, continuing to pay the dividend and then opportunistic share repurchases, and also delevering on our short term floating rate debt. So it's, it's nothing that's rocket science, but it's a matter of kind of continuing to check those different boxes and seeing what makes sense in any given time. We do see increased earnings in fiscal 2024. And that will allow us to have some increased cash flow as well versus '23.\nLorie Tekorius: And the one last thing that I would pitch in there is on growing the lease fleet, there's a lot of tax advantage cash flow. So if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see that our tax deferral has increased. So that is another benefit to growing this lease fleet is the tax benefit from those investments.\nSteve Barger: Very comprehensive answer. Thank you. And I'll just sneak one last in. Sorry if I missed it. Do you expect a similar earnings cadence first half to second half, or did you talk about how some of the sustainable refurbishments, does that level that out as that works into the capacity?\nAdrian Downes: Yes, we didn't talk about that yet, but we would expect something like 45% first half, 55% second half.\nSteve Barger: Perfect. Thanks.\nAdrian Downes: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Matt Elkott with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. Just one last one quick follow up. The 45/55 cadence ADN, does that apply to everything, deliveries, margins, earnings?\nBrian Comstock: Pretty much, yes. I mean, there's going to be some puts and takes in certain lines, but overall, yes, I think that's a reasonable assumption.\nMatt Elkott: Okay.\nAdrian Downes: And Matt, if you're going to do the math on that real quick, we do have more cars going on to the balance sheet kind of in the first half of the year than on the second half. So it is that normal kind of quarter to quarter production scheduling timing thing.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Got it. And Justin, does all the refurbishment revenue, does it all go into manufacturing, or is it some of it in the maintenance of the repair business?\nLorie Tekorius: It does go in both places. It's more the way that we manage it. It's based on the primary activity that goes on in that facility. So to the extent, let's say in Arkansas that we're doing some of these, this program work, it would still show up in manufacturing revenue, even though it's more refurbishment work, because we're managing it as a manufacturing facility.\nMatt Elkott: Okay. I was just trying to gauge, reconcile how deliveries are going to be down in '24 and revenues, I guess manufacturing revenue from deliveries, but manufacturing margin is going to expand unless you guys were talking about these holiday margins. But I thought you said manufacturing margin might expand?\nLorie Tekorius: We do expect, I do expect manufacturing margins to grow. We are not satisfied with  where they are. We do expect that to continue to grow. And that is part of, to the extent that you remember back when Bill Krueger was presenting at Investor Day, and we were talking about our insourcing program, which we expect to reduce or create a benefit of somewhere in $50 million to $55 million by 2025. We are constant, we are not satisfied with where our margins are, and we will continue to be a combination of investing to be in control of our own destiny, as well as to think through how can we operate our facilities more efficiently, whether it's for program work or new rail car manufacturing.\nMatt Elkott: Yes, go ahead, Justin.\nJustin Roberts: If I could just emphasize, so we are guiding to a about a 200 basis point increase in aggregate margins with a good chunk of that is coming out of our manufacturing business just on a full year 2024 versus full year 2023 activity. \nMatt Elkott: Okay, got it. But just like theoretically, just to help me understand it, the reason manufacturing margins would expand on down deliveries is because of the structural improvements you guys are making as part of the bigger plans, as well as a higher portion of refurbishment revenue, which is higher margin.\nBrian Comstock: In addition to, I mean, if you remember back to this year, we had some operating challenges earlier in the year. We are seeing more steady, stable activity and just better operating efficiencies as we kind of continue to recover from the pandemic.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nLorie Tekorius: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you, Sarah. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our call to discuss our fiscal 2023 results, as well as our outlook for 2024. We're excited to get after all of the opportunities that we laid out today, as well as at our investor day back in April. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

      "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to The Greenbrier Companies Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions. Until that time, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. At the request of The Greenbrier Companies, this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts, Vice President, and Treasurer. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.\nJustin Roberts: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter of fiscal 2023 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Lorie Tekorius, Greenbrier's CEO and President; Brian Comstock, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial and Leasing Officer; and Adrian Downes, Senior Vice President, and CFO. Following our update on Greenbrier's performance in Q3 and our outlook for fiscal 2023, we will open up the call for questions. In addition to the press release issued this morning, additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the IR section of our website. Matters discussed on today's conference call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Throughout our discussion today, we will describe some of the important factors that could cause Greenbrier's actual results in 2023 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Greenbrier. And with that I'll hand the call over to Lorie.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone's enjoying the start to summer. Yesterday, hopefully you saw that we announced that Pat Ottensmeyer will join the Greenbrier Board of Directors. I'd like to publicly welcome Pat to our Board and look forward to working with Pat to get his perspectives on the freight rail market, as well as his insight into the U.S. Mexico activity. As many of you know, Greenbrier hosted our inaugural Investor Day on April 12. For those of you who are unable to attend in person, or via webcast, the replay will be available on our website for a short period of time. And the full presentation will be available forever at the SEC website. And during the three-hour event, we touched on four areas. First, our leadership position in our markets. Second, our diverse manufacturing capabilities and long track record of innovation. Third, our strong lease origination capabilities and differentiated syndication model. And lastly, the consistent improvement in our financial performance across economic cycles. We also laid out Greenbrier strategy to increase margins in our manufacturing segments, grow our recurring revenue base through lease fleet investments, and follow a capital allocation strategy focused on returning value to shareholders. And while it's only been two months, since that investor day, I'm pleased to share the progress we've made in each of these areas. In some cases, we're ahead of our own internal schedules and in others, we're laying the foundation to execute our strategic plan. And as I briefly recap results for this quarter, I'll highlight some achievements towards these goals, with the important caveat that we do not expect our progress to be linear, and our strategic plan and targets contemplate a five-year time horizon. Returning to the quarter, we generated revenue of a $1 billion. Our deliveries totaled 6600 units, down from Q2 due to the timing of syndication activity. And while revenue dip slightly compared with the prior quarter aggregate gross margin improved by 190 basis points to 12.3%. Increasing our aggregate gross margin to the mid-teens by fiscal 2026 is one of the targets we provided during the investor day. And we're pleased to report the progress on that front.  Gross margins of manufacturing of 9.6% increased 260 basis points compared with the prior quarter. And some of the efficiencies we discussed during the investor day materialized more quickly than expected. And while there will be unforeseen issues that occurred during some quarters, we're confident that many of the efficiencies achieved thus far will continue. In particular, supply chain issues that have been a recent headwinds seem to be largely in the rearview mirror. And as we've discussed previously, we're bringing fabrication in-house for basic primary parts and sub-assemblies, as part of our make versus buy strategy. The first phase of this work will be completed in the fourth quarter that we're in today. And we expect to achieve our full cost savings targets of $50 million to $55 million in fiscal 2025. Additionally, in the quarter we completed the sale of Gunderson Marine Portland, as part of our capacity rationalization plan that's expected to result in annual savings of $15 million to $20 million. These are costs that are getting taken out of the system permanently. Gunderson rail completed its last railcar on May 18, after shipping over 110,000 units since 1985. I'm extremely pleased to share that Gunderson's new owner will retain many of the hard working production workforce of that facility. Now moving across the business, maintenance services continue the positive momentum seen since the start of the year, despite ongoing labor challenges. Their margins continue to improve sequentially on improved pricing volume and the operating efficiencies we've been focused on establishing over the last two years, expecting a strong end to the year from this segment. And as Brian will discuss shortly, we've laid the foundation for expanded leasing strategy. This is an important component of our multiyear plan and is expected to result in the doubling of recurring revenues within the next five years. The market backdrop for leasing remains very positive, and we're in a great position to execute our plan. Now returning capital to shareholders is an integral part of our capital allocation strategy. I'm pleased to report that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.30 per share yesterday. Our dividend has doubled since its reinstatement in 2014 and illustrates the importance the Board places on this activity. The broader economic background is somewhat mixed, with several factors creating economic crosscurrents. Despite the ongoing economic murkiness, our outlook in North America remains unchanged, with railcar deliveries to be at or near replacement levels for the next few years. In Europe, their softness in demand for intermodal wagons. But this has been more than offset by the bulk rail freight sector, where we continue to see strong demand across widened times. Backdrop aside, at the company level, we continue to take actions to create a stronger, more sustainable Greenbrier. We're confident in the long term strategy we set forth during our investor day and our team's ability to execute on that strategy, which is focused on the things we can control and not reliant on an overly optimistic demand scenario. I look forward to sharing our progress towards these targets on future calls.  And now I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss the rail car demand environment and our leasing activity.\nBrian Comstock : [Technical Difficulty] Lorie. Three Greenbrier secured new railcar orders up 4600 units worth $650 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we received orders for 7900 units valued at $975 million. Orders continue to be broad based and diverse across most railcar types with the exception of intermodal. As of May 31. Greenbrier's global backlog was 23,400 units valued at $2.9 billion. This figure excludes the 7900 units ordered after the end of the quarter. As a reminder, our new railcar backlog does not include 1000 units valued at $85 million that are part of Greenbrier's railcar conversion program. Despite weakness in freight volumes, the railcar demand environment remains stable due to pent up replacement demand and tight supply. And we continue to see healthy railcar inquiries and orders for a variety of rail car types. We are pleased with the performance of leasing and management services in the quarter. Our lease rates on renewals are increasing by double digits and we are extending lease terms while maintaining a high fleet utilization of nearly 99%.  In terms of the underlying leases, the durations are staggered to both mitigate the impact of cyclicality and create upside potential through favorable renewals. We do have a high volume of renewals in 2024 resulting from the portfolio we purchased in September of 2021. And we are actively working to renew these leases ahead of their expiration. As we described during the investor day, we intend to grow more steadily over the coming years, and we have committed to invest $300 million per year for each of the next five years on a net basis. We remain focused on railcar types that will maintain a balanced fleet portfolio and reduce concentration risk. I want to emphasize that we will only invest in the right assets with the right lease terms in counterparties. During Q3, we funded $54 million of debt from our nonrecourse leased railcar warehouse facility backed by 72 million of assets and have funded a total of about $120 million through the warehouse over the last two quarters. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we recently upsize our warehouse facility to 550 million from the prior 350 million borrowing capacity to support our growth plans. The terms of the upsize facility are unchanged. Fourth quarter fleet activity in the warehouse facility will continue to be leveraged at a 75% debt to equity ratio. We are regularly evaluating our financing strategies as we prepare to meaningfully increase the size of our lease fleet with the goal of more than doubling recurring revenue in the next five years. As you heard during the investor day from William Glenn, who had Greenbrier's European operations, we are building a leasing capabilities in Europe. Our entry into the European leasing is well ahead of plan and the pipeline for leasing deals is robust, including finalizing our first syndication agreement. Our Capital Markets team syndicated 800 railcars in the quarter, a decrease from Q2, reflecting the timing of production schedules. This market remains liquid and a strong appetite for the asset class. And our team is preparing for another busy year in 2024. Within management services, we continue to shift our commercial focus and business development efforts towards customers whose needs are more closely aligned with our core competencies as we seek to deepen relationships within our customer base. This is an exciting time for Greenbrier as we work to optimize our manufacturing capabilities, and grow the leasing and management business. We have been clear with our growth initiatives and I look forward to updating you on them as we execute on our strategic plan.  With that said, I'll hand the call over to Adrian, who will now speak to the financial highlights in the quarter.\nAdrian Downes: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Before moving into the highlights of the quarter, I would like to remind everyone that quarterly financial information is available in the press release and supplemental slides which can be found on our website. Our performance in the quarter was strong across all business segments with improved aggregate gross margin and adjusted EPS in Q3 compared to Q2. Following the highlights of the [Technical Difficulty] for the quarter include second consecutive quarter with revenues of a $1 billion or higher, deliveries of 6600 units was the second highest quarter for deliveries since the fourth quarter of 2019 and includes 200 units from our unconsolidated joint venture in Brazil. Aggregate gross margin of 12.3% was 190 basis points higher than the prior quarter, resulting from stronger margins in the manufacturing and maintenance services segments attributed to improved operating efficiencies in both segments at higher pricing and volumes in the maintenance services segment. We expect the operating momentum will continue as a result of the initiatives described during the Investor Day in April. Selling and administrative expense of $63 million is 7% higher from Q2 primarily attributed to an increase in employee related costs due to higher incentive compensation expense as a result of increased profitability. We had a pretax charge of $17 million related to the sale and exit of our Gunderson Marine business in Portland. The consolidated tax rate of 12.9% was primarily a result of favorable discrete items in Mexico. Excluding the impact of the Gunderson loss on sale and exit related costs, adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $34 million generated adjusted EPS of $1.02. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA da for the quarter was about $97 million or 9.3% of revenue. Turning to liquidity, Greenbrier's operating cash flow turned positive on a year-to-date basis due to a strong third quarter and -- sorry, due to strong third quarter results of nearly $98 million, reflecting improvements to operating performance and working capital efficiencies. Our liquidity was $665 million at the end of Q3, consisting of cash of $321 million and available borrowings of $344 million. The primary use of our cash during the recent quarter included the repayment of $95 million of short term borrowings on our domestic revolving credit facility, as well as $32 million of share repurchases. As we finish 2023, we expect Q4 liquidity levels to remain strong as operating momentum and working capital efficiencies continued to improve.  As highlighted during our investor day in April, one of Greenbrier strategic initiatives is a balanced approach to capital allocation. An integral part of this strategy is to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  During the third quarter Greenbrier repurchased 1.2 million shares for $32 million. Between the second and third quarter Greenbrier repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares for $49 million, of which 3 million was part of the prior authorization program. Under the current share repurchase program, we have $54 million remaining of the 100 million authorization that extends through January of 2025. In addition to significant share repurchase activity, the Board increased the dividend by 11% to $0.30 per share, representing our 37th consecutive dividend. Based on yesterday's closing price or annual dividend represents a yield of approximately 3.7%. Since 2014, Greenbrier has returned over $470 million of capital to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Our Board and management team remain committed to a balanced deployment of capital designed to create long term shareholder value. Turning to our guidance and business outlook, based on current trends and production schedules, we are raising Greenbrier's fiscal 2023 guidance, which includes the following: our fiscal '23 deliveries guidance is increased to 25,000 to 26,000 units, including approximately 1000 units from Greenbrier-Maxion and Brazil. We're also increasing our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance to be between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion. Selling and administrative expenses at approximately $230 million to $235 million. And gross capital expenditures of approximately $280 million and leasing and management services, $90 million in manufacturing and $15 million in maintenance services. And proceeds of equipment sales are expected to be approximately $76 million. Consolidated gross margin is unchanged, and we expect full year consolidated margin percent to be in the low double digits. In closing, I'd like to reiterate a few points. We are confident in our long term strategy as highlighted at our investor day, I believe the best is yet to come. Our management team is incredibly experienced with a demonstrated track record of success. We are supported by a robust backlog, which provides strong visibility and stability over the coming years. Our liquidity and balance sheet strength allows for opportunistic growth. And as we look to strongly finish our year, we're well positioned to drive shareholder value into in 2024.  Now we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Matt Elkott TD Cowen. You may now go ahead.\nMatt Elkott : Good morning. Thank you. Lorie, can you maybe first quick clarification, what was it specifically that made it possible to achieve those manufacturing efficiencies ahead of plan?\nLorie Tekorius: A great question, Matt. I would say it's tremendous hard work and focus by the men and women in our manufacturing operations. As you'll recall, last quarter, we talked about -- second quarter we talked about the headwinds that we were struggling with supply chain and our focus on how to reverse that trend. This is one of the areas where we're seeing improvement ahead of what we thought internally we would be able to achieve. As not just Greenbrier but as many companies have seen over the last several years supply chain can be one of those things that can be a persistent headwind, or it can pop up. So I'm just pleased with the focus and attention and execution in our manufacturing group.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Thank you for that. And then were there any big orders from a single customer in either the 4600 in the quarter or the 7900 after?\nLorie Tekorius: I'll let Brian to chime in in a minute if he'd like. But actually, yes, we had several large orders, but nothing that was really a multiyear or something that drove it that was strong diverse demand across a number of customers, car types, commodities, and a nice healthy combination of lease originations, as well as direct sales. Brian, is there anything you'd like to add?\nBrian Comstock: No, I think you hit it, Lorie. Matt, basically, it's kind of the normal blocking and tackling, we had several large orders, not just one or two. But also we had kind of the diversity of what we see every day. Some of it was pent up from earlier in the quarter, which we thought would come in Q3 and as are in the previous quarter is now coming in now. But it's just kind of the run of the mill, no multiyear orders, just your kind of standard fare, as far as the order came in order diversity. \nMatt Elkott: That's good to know, Brian. And there was a 10%, sequential step up in the ASP, how much of this was mixed versus other factors, because after the -- for the 7900, after Q3, I think the ASP goes back down to being 4% below 2Q.\nBrian Comstock: Yes, I think the mix is it's a better mix, we're starting to see a little bit more automotive product, as well as tank cars into the mix. As you know, one of the focuses of I think the industry has been continued to do pricing into a better place as well. And so I think you're seeing a combination of a better mix as well as continued uplift in pricing. \nMatt Elkott: Okay, and just one last one, if I may. More often than not your first fiscal half is the lower for everything basically deliveries margins earnings, do you expect this to be the case for fiscal '24, even as this really is a highly anomalous cycle?\nLorie Tekorius: So I'll jump in, and then I can let others join it. I'm sorry to kind of have a little bit of a chuckle. Because you're right, we do tend to like in the second half and then in are a little bit muted for a variety of reasons in the first half of that has not gone without our own acknowledgment of that trend. And we're very focused on how can we make certain that quarter after quarter we continue continuous improvements from orders, deliveries, margins, cash flow, so you are going to see that sort of focus.  Again, it's hard to perfectly predict if there's going to be something that pops up. But we're not planning to have the first half of next year be soft. We're planning for fiscal 24 to be better than 2023. And we're working to make that be continuous improvement quarter after quarter.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Thank you very much, Lorie. Thanks, Brian.\nLorie Tekorius: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Justin Long with Stephens. You may now go ahead.\nJustin Long : Thanks, and good morning. Maybe to follow up on that last point you made Lorie. When you look at the industry projections for railcar production in 2024 on a calendar basis, a lot of those forecasts are down a decent amount. So I'm curious if you could talk about your view on this broader industry production as we move into year fiscal '24. And based on the backlog you have today, including the orders you've just received here in June, can you speak to your level of visibility to production in 2024 at this point?\nLorie Tekorius: I would say for 2024, we've got really good visibility, we still do have some pockets where we have open production, but we feel very comfortable about the ability to fill up that space. Right now what we're seeing in North America is pretty steady production coming out of where we're going to close out the fourth quarter. We don't have any big ramp ups or any big ramp downs, we'll have some adjustments. But some of the recent orders that we've received really give us great visibility and continuity on a number of our production lines. The other interesting thing that if you're just looking at the North American statistics, you also have to look at Europe, where we're continuing to focus on how we can serve that market. And we're focused on ramping up production in Europe as well, it's not quite the same volume, as you would see here in North America. But that will be one of the benefits to our deliveries in our fiscal 2024.\nJustin Long: Okay, great, that's helpful. And I guess shifting to manufacturing gross margins, it was good to see the sequential improvement. Could you speak to how much of that came in North America versus Europe? And then as we think about manufacturing gross margins going forward, what's your comfort that we'll continue to see some sequential momentum moving into fourth quarter and early next year?\nJustin Roberts: Hey, Justin, this is Justin. I think we saw improvement, both in North America and Europe in the quarter, North America has a disproportionate weighting there, just from a size perspective of both operations performed very well and improved sequentially. And then going forward, we would expect that to continue maybe not quite to the same extent, but we do see improvement in Q4 and into fiscal 2024, which is kind of hard to believe we're talking about already, but such as life.\nJustin Long: Okay, good to hear. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.\nLorie Tekorius: Thanks, Justin. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. You may now go ahead.\nBascome Majors : Thank you. As we look forward, I realize we\u2019re still away from next fiscal year. But do you have a sense of the cadence of when you'll put cars on the balance sheet and off the balance sheet in the manufacturing business?\nJustin Roberts: I think at this point, it's we're not necessarily ready to get into that much detail. I would say that we will -- we do see a relatively consistent pattern of that each quarter over the next four to five quarters based on production schedules and backlog.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. And now that most of the supply chain issues in Mexico and the U.S. are behind you fingers crossed. Is Europe accretive to the overall manufacturing margin, or are those pretty even?\nLorie Tekorius: I would say yes, it is accretive. As Justin said, it's accretive even when you take into consideration the fact of the waiting. I mean, North America is one of the largest freight railcar markets in the world. So it's going to be hard to for Europe to up in that. But they're definitely accretive to our margins.\nBascome Majors: And, you know, lastly speaking, can you talk a little bit about the willingness to risk longer term capital from some of your leasing customers. I know you don't have the same length and duration and size and multi years are some of your competitors, but just what's the appetite for the leasing companies as we look out the next 6, 12, 18 months? How was that sales channel work, and do you expect that to be supportive of a fairly steady production rate for the industry over the next year or two? Thank you.\nJustin Roberts: That's a great question, Bascome. I just going to see if Mr. Comstock can handle it.\nBrian Comstock: Yes, thanks Justin and thanks Bascome. One of the areas that I think I report on this maybe last quarter as well as we are seeing an increased interest by the operating lessors. They are traditionally in the market, but over the last couple of years due to COVID and other reasons. There's been a little bit of a pullback, we're seeing more and more confidence on the operating lessor side, which is driving as you suggest more stability in the manufacturing as well as some of this order pipeline, and we think that's going to continue to build momentum throughout the rest of this year into next year.\nBascome Majors: And from the syndication channel, any comments on that customer? Are they starting to get comfortable with the cost of capital and rising interest rates? Just you know, do you think that is a growth opportunity, or at least an opportunity for stability in your business as we look out 6, 12, 18 months?\nBrian Comstock: And Justin, I can grab this one as well. Yes, we do. You know, the returns are still very strong. As you know, interest rate pressures have put a lot of -- really a lot of pressure on that side of the house. But the deals that are coming in all hurdle have the appropriate internal rate of returns. And so as a result, we're seeing more and more interest. In fact, we're seeing even some new entrants that are inquiring about coming into the space. So we feel pretty good from the liquidity standpoint. And long term we think the syndication customers are pretty comfortable.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nKen Hoexter : Great, good morning. So if I could just kind of follow on a little bit on Bascome's question there. Lorie, maybe talk a little bit about the balance of the least fleet versus the build for external sales and manufacturing. It seems like we've got a lot of volatility where maybe it's you'll get the consistency after you get the ramp up. So are you getting closer to the full ramp up on that production for the internal build versus external sales? I just want to understand how we should think about that given the build to revenue, kind of take follow through?\nLorie Tekorius: Thanks, Ken. Yes, it's a good question. And what's interesting is you have to step back and look at the strength [Technical Difficulty] origination. So same customers, same car type, same commodity. While we are growing our own balance sheet lease fleet, it is still a fairly modest fleet. And sometimes the size of those orders are such that it would really skew our concentration. \nKen Hoexter: Lorie, I don't mean to interrupt, but your line went quiet for like the first third of your answer. I'm sorry to do it. But I'm getting IB that other people, they went quiet. Do you mind just starting from the beginning there?\nLorie Tekorius: Oh, my gosh, it was the most brilliant thing I've ever thought. So it's probably because every one of our field sales people was hurriedly calling in because I was complementing our sales -- can you still hear me? \nKen Hoexter: Yes, perfectly.\nLorie Tekorius: So we often can originate some very large leases. So a large number of cars, same customer, same car type, same commodity. While we're excited to grow our own balance sheet lease fleet, it is still a relatively modest and I'm probably being generous size. Therefore, any of those orders could really skew our concentrations in any number of those areas.  So we will continue to work with our syndication partners so that we can diversify and keep that disciplined approach to how we're growing our own balance sheet portfolio. Sometimes our syndication partners are not as keen on our fiscal year, quarter ends or year ends as others might be. So we're going to take those opportunities when they arise. And we're going to close those transactions as appropriate for the business.  So that will continue to cause some lumpiness from quarter to quarter. But you can understand that they the basis is we've got strong commercial lease origination capabilities. And we're keeping an eye on having a very disciplined approach to how we're growing the fleet on the balance sheet.\nKen Hoexter: And then I'm throw at you for my follow up a quick numbers question. So I'll follow up with a kind of follow on question. But the backlog new orders came in at about 123 revenues per car down from your printed 141,000 in that third quarter. Is there anything more to that than then mix? Because that just seems like an extraordinary shift? And then I guess to wrap up, you said you weren't surprised by anything in the quarter yet, you raised your outlook. So I just want to understand what changed, was there something in there that that did change that led you to raise the outlook?\nBrian Comstock: So Ken on the ASP question, our ASP on the June order activity is more in line with our Q1 and Q2 activity. And it really is just mixed primarily from that perspective versus the Q3. And I think on the outlook question, obviously, Lorie can correct and chime in as needed.  But bear in mind that we as we have been working through and navigating some of the supply chain issues, the first six months of the year, were challenging, and we wanted to make sure that we were able to perform as we expected and deliver cars on time to our customers. And we had some bumpiness in the first part of the year. So now is that seems to have sunset and we are getting our operating momentum and getting our legs under us. We are feeling more confident.\nKen Hoexter: Wonderful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo Securities, you may not go ahead. \nRyan Deveikis : Good morning. This is Ryan Deveikis on for Allison. Congrats on the quarter. Most of my questions were taken, but I kind of want to just pick a little bit, just kind of the smaller market here. So Brazil, came in 200 on the quarter, it didn't really raises delivery there that implies by my calc around 100. Is that market kind of just softening? Or, you know, is it just a near term headwind that it's like winter.\nBrian Comstock: So, this is Brian, I can jump in Lorie on that question. Right now in Brazil, you're in a little bit of an and I see a little bit probably over the next six months, they're in a bit of a softer period only due to capital restraints of some of the concessionaires. In 2024 it looks like things begin to right size as well as a lot of the expansion in Brazil continues to build momentum, there is quite a bit of infrastructure in Central Brazil and other areas that are being completed. So we anticipate long term that Brazil is going to continue to grow. However, right now they're more in a level data play.\nRyan Deveikis : Okay, thank you. And then I guess one more on the refurbishment side, net backlog has been kind of declining, are we reaching closer to like an end of like market cycle here where there's not as much activity on those that side of the conversions or whatever it's called just any color, there would be great?\nBrian Comstock: This is Brian, I can dive in again. The conversion side is always lumpy. And it kind of moves up and down. There are a number of cars that have been programmed already. And there is kind of a finite shelf life to the conversions. But I still think there is seems to be at least several years of opportunity on that side. And then kind of behind the conversions you've got this requalification to tank cars that are ramping up. So I think what you'll see is just a shift from some of the large conversions to some of the large tank car requalification programs.\nRyan Deveikis : Perfect, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now go ahead. Q - Jacob Moore \nJacob Moore: Hi, good morning. This is Jacob Moore on for Steve Barger. Thank you for taking the questions. So for my first one, just going back to the cost savings initiatives that you laid out at the investor day. Could you talk specifically about the actions that you've already got completed and maybe quantify how much of that $50 million to $55 million you think you've already achieved? And then also maybe just a quick clarification on the 20 -- $15 million to $20 million in savings from Gunderson exit, is that now fully out of the system moving forward?\nBrian Comstock: Hey, Jacob, this is Brian, it seems we've lost like us, I think they're having some communication problems. I can address the first part of that question for you, which is on the $50 billion to $55 billion of cost savings. We're probably we're still in the infancy of implementing that plan. It is ahead of schedule, as you see from the -- as you can see from this quarter\u2019s earnings, but we anticipate that that will continue to develop really throughout the next fiscal year.\nJacob Moore: Got it understood. And then maybe this one's a little bit better suited for you anyways, Brian, for my second question, just broadly, overall rail traffic is down, freight seems to be holding in there. But lackluster traffic trends are starting to compound at this point. So my question is really now the work at the halfway point of the year. Could you expand on the earlier landscape comments and maybe provide an updated outlook on rail traffic trends for the remainder of the year?\nBrian Comstock: Yes, there's undoubtedly, when you look at the traffic side of the equation, velocities improving a bit, there's a number of segments that are down because the number of segments in the rail industry that are still fairly robust. Auto, there's a tremendous amount of pent up demand. There's a number of new facilities coming online. There are several new plastic pellets facilities that come online in late 2024, early 2025.  Biodiesel continues to be fairly robust. And a lot of new facilities coming online in that area as well. And then you still have a tremendous amount of retirements of older cars, as well as a small number of cars and storage. So while there are some headwinds, in the overall outlook, the build cycle still looks fairly level at least we believe so over the next 18 to 36 months. Pending any major change and the economic condition.\nJacob Moore: Got it. Understood. Thanks. All right, go ahead.\nLorie Tekorius: Can you hear us okay? \nJacob Moore: Yes. \nLorie Tekorius: So I just want to check and make sure that we're still broadcasting here. Sorry, we've had a few technical difficulties. Thank you, Justin, for your phone. Just to touch on your other comment about Gunderson, there probably be a little bit of we won't have realized all of that permanent savings in our fourth quarter. But you know, as we get into the early part of our fiscal 24 that will be wrapped up. Because we're just working with the new owners for some transition services.\nJacob Moore: Got it. Understood. Thank you for taking the questions.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question we have follow up from Matt Elkott or TD Cowen, you may now go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Thank you for taking my follow ups. I think this is for Brian, Brian, the leases coming up for renewal in '24 that you mentioned. If you are able to get them renewed earlier, the market is pretty hot right now. What kind of rate improvement do you think you can get expiring versus renewal side? \nBrian Comstock: Good question, Matt. A lot of the renewals that we're seeing in 2024, related to the purchase that we did, back in 2021, the fleet that we acquired, and a lot of those rates were, I would say sub market rates at the time. And so we believe we're seeing quarter over quarter double digits, but in in those cases, we should see much larger double digit increases in the renewals in 2024 for at least that's what we're predicting at this stage, Matt. \nMatt Elkott: And how many cars are those? \nBrian Comstock: That's a great question. I don't have that at my fingertips, but I'm sure Justin can get back to you on that.\nJustin Roberts: Yes, I just say it's about 2000 cars. \nMatt Elkott: Okay, thanks, Justin. And then just maybe one more question for Justin or Lorie. You're pretty close to the mid-teens aggregate gross margin target for '26 quarter. So first, any updated thoughts on this target? And second, can you remind us what the target is contingent on, do we have to be in a demand upcycle does it work at a you know at high replacement level or below replacement level demand because the recurring parts of the business should grow?\nLorie Tekorius: So, good question, Matt. And I would say that the targets are based on more stable demand so not a boom market. And I think while we're excited about the achievements that we've received in this third quarter, we'd like to get a quarter two of continuous improvement under our belt before we'll consider adjusting those five year targets.\nMatt Elkott: Okay, got it. Just one last one. I probably should know this. But have you guys said what's going to happen to Gunderson? What kind of what use is it going to be used for?\nLorie Tekorius: Oh, yes, if that hasn't come through, so it was purchased by a local operation here run by a couple of local Portland people, Oregon green manufacturing, they're going to continue marine activities, but they're going to expand more broadly than we were able to do. And I think they're looking at some other metal building -- metal bending activities or possibly some other infrastructure work.\nMatt Elkott: But rail cars are going to be manufactured there anymore? \nLorie Tekorius: Yes. I should have been clear about that, no rail cars. \nMatt Elkott: Got it. Great. Thank you very much.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Justin Roberts for any closing remarks.\nJustin Roberts: Thanks, Anthony. Sorry for everybody, technical issues this morning. Appreciate your patience. Hope everyone has a great day. And if you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Greenbrier either myself if you have my email or investor relations@gbrx.com. Thanks and have a great day. \nLorie Tekorius:  Have a Happy Independence week and be safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded thank you for attending today's presentation.

      "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to The Greenbrier Companies First Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions. Until that time, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. At the request of The Greenbrier Companies, this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts, Vice President, and Treasurer. Mr. Roberts, you may begin.\nJustin Roberts: Thank you, MJ. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter of fiscal 2023 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Lorie Tekorius, Greenbrier's CEO and President; Brian Comstock, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial and Leasing Officer; and Adrian Downes, Senior Vice President, and CFO. Following our update on Greenbrier's performance in Q1 and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, we will open up the call for questions. In addition to the press release issued this morning, additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the IR section of our website. I'd like to remind you that matters discussed on today's conference call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Throughout our discussion today, we will describe some of the important factors that could cause Greenbrier's actual results in 2023 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Greenbrier. Good morning, Lorie.\nLorie Tekorius: Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone had a good holiday season. Our first quarter results showed areas of continued strength and identifiable opportunities to improve our operations. We produced 6,800 units in the quarter, a 10% sequential increase. Of these 2,300 units are investments held on our balance sheet to be syndicated our capitalized into Greenbrier's long-term lease fleet in a future period. Remaining customer deliveries totaled 4,800 units. Revenue was in line with expectations. However, the efficiencies expected from higher production levels have not yet been fully realized. Aggregate gross margin was impacted by higher cost of outsourced components driven by inflation, transportation expense, and other logistics challenges. Material shortages and delays and other lingering supply chain issues including rail congestion in Mexico, created production disruptions primarily at our manufacturing operations in Mexico. We remain focused on managing our cost and supply chain. We're optimizing our internal fabrication capacity, which will improve profitability by having more control over vital supply chain and address supply chain inefficiencies. Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings release, we will seize new railcar production at our Portland, Oregon facility in May following the delivery of existing commitments. This is not a decision we've taken lightly, given our history of manufacturing railcars in Portland. However, it's an action that reflects our commitment to optimize the efficiency of our manufacturing footprint and deliver stronger margin. We're undertaking a strategic evaluation of our marine business, which operates at the same facility. We're currently engaged in a range of discussions to determine both the future of marine operations and the overall use of the Portland facility. I remain confident we'll attain a good outcome for all of our stakeholders, which include employees, customers, and shareholders. Our Maintenance Services Group continued their positive momentum and started 2023 with a strongest Q1 performance in five years as initiatives focused on increasing efficiency translated to results. Our Wheel business unfortunately was negatively impacted by increased labor and transportation costs. We're currently working with our customers to modify contracts to address the current cost environment. Turning to the U.S. economy, while it continues to its resilience rising interest rates and inflation now weigh on growth. The labor market has remained strong, and we're cautiously optimistic about the industrial sector of consumer spending soften. The economy appears to be normalizing after years of unprecedented demand caused by lockdowns and subsequent government stimulus. As a result, economic activity will slow with an estimated annual U.S. GDP growth rate of only 0.2% in 2023. The lower outlook projects an economic soft landing that will be characterized by a strong labor market, but with elevated inflation and interest rates throughout the year. Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity, will likely determine the timing and depth of the slowdown. We continue to believe the North American rail freight segment will be resilient through a mild recession. Rail labor negotiations in the latter months of calendar 2022 drew broad public awareness to the integral role the rail industry plays in our economy. The near term threat of a railroad workers strike ended on December 2 with President Biden signing preventative legislation. However, challenging railroad service conditions now follow us into this new year. We're optimistic the railroads will make steady progress on their service models over the course of the year and increased hiring is an early positive step in this direction. Turning to our European business. Despite an energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian war, high inflation and the rising interest rates, the European economy appears to be holding up well. Energy prices are down from their peaks due to a mild winter and gas storage facilities at full capacity. German industrial output grew in the last quarter, surprising most analysts. And rail traffic levels in Europe are high and fleet utilization is nearly 100% for most wagon types. The one exception is international container traffic where volumes are down due to the sluggish Chinese economy, which continues to struggle with COVID. Our European business performed well despite the war and lingering effects of the pandemic. And now turning to some other milestones in Q1. On November 1, we released the fourth annual edition of our ESG report On Track Together. I'm pleased to report, the Group have been identified on the list of the most responsible companies in America, according to Newsweek and the global research and data firm, Statista. The third-party recognition validates Greenbrier's commitment to our values and our pursuit of responsible corporate citizenship. On a company level, we continue to review and optimize our portfolio to create a stronger, more sustainable Greenbrier. As announced earlier this week, we've acquired the minority interest in GBX leasing from the Longwood Group. This action bolsters Greenbrier's leasing platform, simplifies our business structure and promises long-term value to our shareholders. Growing our leasing business provides us a broader, more holistic view of the railcar equipment market than not solely an OEM builder. It also discourages the prospect of overbuilding since an asset can be on our books for over 30 years. Despite the short-term operating challenges, momentum is good entering calendar 2023. With strong railcar order activity and elevated lease rates, we're confident in Greenbrier's long-term strategy and our team's execution. On our last quarterly call, we mentioned we discussed the strategy further at our upcoming Investor Day. We're currently planning to hold that event in April and look forward to sharing additional details soon. And now I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss the railcar demand environment and our leasing activity.\nBrian Comstock: Thanks, Lorie, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, Greenbrier secured new railcar orders of 5,600 units worth $700 million, a 17% increase from Q4. These orders extend production into calendar 2024. We delivered 4,800 units in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times. As of November 30, Greenbrier's global backlog was 28,300 units valued at $3.4 billion, an indication of the strength of our customer relationships, and demand for Greenbrier's products and services. As a reminder, our new railcar backlog does not include 1,800 units valued at $150 million that are part of Greenbrier's railcar conversion programs. We continue to see healthy railcar inquiries and orders for a variety of railcar types despite a slowing economy. As we pursue commercial and leasing transactions, we are employing pricing discipline that considers current market dynamics and the state of the economy. Railcars and storage are at a cyclical low due to demand spikes, rail freight service challenges and retirements outpacing new railcar deliveries. From January to November of 2022, there have been approximately 50,000 railcars scrapped. This is more than delivered in all of calendar 2022. Type railcar supply provides tailwinds for new orders in a range of railcar types. Earlier this week, we announced the buyout of the minority stake in GBX Leasing, our railcar leasing joint venture. Full ownership of the fleet furthers our leasing strategy while simplifying our business structure. We are pleased with the performance of leasing and management services in the quarter. Our lease rates on renewal are increasing by double-digits, and we are extending lease terms while maintaining a high fleet utilization of 98%. Our lease fleet grew to 14,100 units at the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that a number of the units added to our lease fleet in the quarter could be syndicated over the course of the fiscal year. We intend to grow our long-term lease fleet by approximately 2,000 units this fiscal year. Fleet growth for the year is focused on railcar types that will further diversify the fleet, reducing concentration risk. We funded another $40 million of leasing term debt during the quarter and will fund the final $35 million in Q2. Additionally, we have not borrowed on the $350 million leased railcar warehouse facility, although we are evaluating financing strategy for the remaining of our lease fleet adds for fiscal '23. Our capital markets team syndicated 300 railcars in the quarter, a decrease from last quarter due to the timing of production activity. We continue to successfully navigate the compound challenges of higher debt costs and higher railcar pricing. However, we do see sufficient investor liquidity in the market for the duration of fiscal 2023. With one fiscal quarter in the books, we enter calendar 2023 energized and excited by the opportunities in front of us to grow our leasing business and successfully execute our market-leading syndication strategy. All of this supports our ultimate goal to provide our customers maximum flexibility to access Greenbrier's superior products and services. Adrian will now speak to the financial highlights in the quarter.\nAdrian Downes: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Before moving into the highlights of the quarter, I would like to remind everyone that quarterly financial information is available in the press release and supplemental slides, which can be found on our website. Our performance in Q1 was mixed with strong commercial, leasing and maintenance services performance, offset by headwinds in the manufacturing business, particularly in North America. A few items I want to speak to for the first quarter included revenue of $767 million, which decreased sequentially primarily from the production of 2,300 leased railcars on to the balance sheet. As a reminder, we do not recognize manufacturing revenue or margin until the railcar leaves our balance sheet. However, we do recognize lease income for railcars on our balance sheet. This activity is more of a timing variance since these railcars will either be syndicated or capitalized into our long-term leased late later in the year. Deliveries of 4,800 units include 300 units from our unconsolidated joint venture in Brazil. Aggregate gross margins of 9.1% reflect higher costs for outsourced components, material shortages and lingering supply chain issues, including rail congestion in Mexico. We are investing in internal fabrication capacity to improve our control over this aspect of our supply chain while the rail congestion continues to slowly improve. Selling and administrative expense of $53 million is 22% lower from Q4, primarily as a result of lower employee related costs, including incentive compensation and consulting expense. The pretax impairment charge of $24.2 million was related to long-lived assets at our Portland and Oregon manufacturing facility. This was triggered by the decision to end new railcar production at the facility after an evaluation of our production capacity requirements. Excluding the impact of this impairment, adjusted net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $1.6 million generated adjusted EPS of $0.05 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.7 million or 6.4% of revenue. Greenbrier's liquidity was $477 million at the end of Q1, consisting of cash of $263 million and available borrowings of $214 million. Our liquidity remains ample, the primary use of our cash during the recent quarter included a continuing investment into our lease fleets and the expenditure of working capital related to the manufacturing supply chain issues we have already mentioned. As a result of the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet, we continue to be well positioned to navigate these market dynamics. During fiscal 2023, we expect liquidity levels to increase from improvements in operating results and working capital efficiencies as well as increased borrowing capacity resulting from more railcars placed on our balance sheet. As a result, the remaining tax -- as a reminder, the remaining tax refund associated with the CARES Act of roughly $30 million is anticipated to be collected this fiscal year and will be additive to Greenbrier's available cash and borrowing capacity. Greenbrier has $100 million authorized under our share repurchase program, which was just extended by our Board of Directors through January 2025. Our Board and management team remain committed to a balanced deployment of capital designed to create long-term shareholder value. We will continue to use this capacity opportunistically based on fluctuations in the price of Greenbrier shares and within the framework of our broader capital allocation plan. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have repurchased nearly 100,000 shares. Finally, on January 5, Greenbrier's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share, our 35th consecutive dividend. Since reinstating the dividend in 2014, Greenbrier has returned over $400 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Based on yesterday's closing price, our annual dividend represents a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%. Turning to our guidance and business outlook. Based on current trends and production schedules, we are maintaining Greenbrier's fiscal 2023 guidance, which includes deliveries of 22,000 to 24,000 units, including approximately 1,000 units from Greenbrier-Maxion in Brazil. Revenue between $3.2 billion and $3.6 billion. Selling and administrative expenses of approximately $220 million to $230 million. Gross capital expenditures of approximately $240 million in leasing and management services, $80 million in manufacturing and $10 million in maintenance services. Proceeds of equipment sales are expected to be approximately $110 million. Our now wholly-owned lease, lease will increase by at least 2,000 units in fiscal 2023. We will see how the leasing market evolves throughout the year, and we'll be flexible and opportunistic in our growth strategy for the fleet. Gross margins, we expect full year consolidated margins will be in the low double-digits. Our bottom line results in Q1 do not fully characterize the improvements and positive momentum occurring in our business. We expect our performance to improve in the coming quarters as we hit our stride, and we see the benefits of tough decisions taken in Q1. Our management team is experienced with a demonstrated track record of success. Our robust backlog provides strong visibility and stability over the coming years, and we look forward to improved results as we progress through the year. And now, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning.\nLorie Tekorius: Good morning, Justin.\nJustin Long: I wanted to start with a question on the supply chain. Just given the trends there seem to be a little bit disappointing relative to expectations. Any updated thoughts on the supply chain recovery going forward? And for the ceasing of railcar manufacturing operations at Portland and the increased capacity internally as it relates to fabrication. Is there any way to put a number around the cost impact that could have going forward?\nLorie Leeson: So I would just say on taking and parsing through some of that.\nAdrian Downes: It was like three questions in one, Justin.\nLorie Leeson: Starting with the supply chain, I think as we have ramped up our activities as well as other industrial manufacturers that has put more pressure on the supply chain that we rely on, particularly in Mexico, which we recognized and have taken the action to start in-sourcing initially the vital components that we need for building railcars and making certain that we are achieving the kind of cost that we need to. So we're not happy with what happened in the first quarter, but we are taking action and we expect that new fabrication facility to be online early in our fourth fiscal quarter. So things are changing and moving. I think as we talked about it, we would expect this to be probably a couple of hundred basis points of margin impact as we move through the fiscal year associated with supply chain. With the Portland, Oregon facility, not sure that we would quantify a facility-by-facility financial results. You do see the asset impairment that we took that's associated with the railcar piece of our business, evaluating the assets that are dedicated to railcar production and adjusting those to an appraised value and we are still in the process of evaluating our Marine business to determine what comes of that. And then the last question, no, I don't remember. We're not going to be using the Gunderson facility for any of the sub-components. This is in-sourcing that will happen near our facilities in Mexico.\nJustin Long: Got it. I think you tackled everything. And just to clarify one point, when you mentioned a couple of hundred basis points of improvement in gross margins from the supply chain. Is that manufacturing gross margins? And is that just solely related to the supply chain getting better or is that incorporating what you're doing on the fabrication side?\nJustin Roberts: So Justin, that is on manufacturing, and that is solely related to what we're doing on the internal fabrication piece. The improvement or, I guess, I would say, lack of disruption on the supply chain going forward is a little harder to quantify, but I would say that, that's a similar, if not maybe even larger number ultimately.\nJustin Long: Okay. That's helpful. And then last thing I wanted to ask about was just the railcar order environment. Could you break down orders in the quarter between North America and international? And maybe, Brian, you could chime in on the sustainability of this kind of 5,000 to 6,000 orders per quarter flow going forward?\nBrian Comstock: Yeah, Justin, it's Brian. About 95% of the orders in the Q were for North America. So substantially in North America, we're already -- December was a stronger month than what we typically see because of the holidays. So we're already off to a good start. I would say the cadence continues to be very similar to what we've seen in the last three, four quarters in North America. We're not seeing any falloff at all at this stage.\nJustin Long: Great. Very helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the manufacturing margins. Typically, we see a falloff in second quarter. I don't know if given the closing of Portland, it sounds like that doesn't occur until May or some of the other moves you're making -- are there going to be increased costs given the fabrication moves as well as still getting the supply chain online until that's up and running in the fourth quarter? So do we see and even extended dip in 2Q on margins. Maybe just walk us through, Adrian, your thoughts or Lorie, on kind of seasonality and impact from the moves you're making?\nLorie Leeson: And I'll start, and then Adrian or Justin can chime in. But it\u2019s a good point, Ken, that yes, seasonally, second -- our second fiscal quarter, which includes a lot of holidays does sometimes have an impact on our margins. So there's -- it's probably a mixed bag as you think about how we step through the year. We're not going to get into quarter-by-quarter margin expectations. We do expect there to be, though, an overall improvement as we move across each of the quarters of this fiscal year. Regarding rail production at Gunderson, we had a full quarter of production in the first quarter at our Portland facility, and that will continue through May. So we will have those three quarters, which I would say is, it's neutral to a bit of a drag on margins, but that's where I would say that kind of shakes out. And any additional costs that are associated with ceasing those productions or the transition of our workforce, we will make certain to capture those separately and communicate them separately.\nAdrian Downes: And Ken also the investment in bringing the fabrication in-house is something that will be capitalized, that would be something that will provide long-term benefits. So you wouldn't see necessarily a higher operating expense from that, you would see overall market -- margin improvement.\nJustin Roberts: And finally, Ken, one other piece on to that as we progress through the year, we will see the increased syndication activity, which is typically beneficial to overall company margins throughout the year.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks for that everybody. And then I guess, in the past, you've given kind of the balance of production and what you expect, maybe it sounded like Lorie, you threw out at the end of your last answer that there was no slowdown in the orders. Maybe talk about how back-end loaded production will be and the move, I guess, away from Portland to Mexico. Is that -- obviously, we had a huge surprise on cost this quarter given all the things you mentioned. Is that just determination that it's just too costly in the U.S. and moving everything to Mexico? And does that mean anything for the U.S. assets from ARI that you acquired in the U.S. or was this Portland specific?\nLorie Leeson: So this was Portland specific. We are not intending to relocate all of our manufacturing to Mexico. There's definitely a lot of benefits and value of having a U.S. manufacturing footprint. The facilities that we acquired was announced in 2019. They continue to perform well. And as you think through deliveries and the impact from ceasing the production at the Portland facility, they're running at a very, very modest pace. So I would say it's not something you're going to really notice as -- and looking at the quarterly delivery activity, particularly as in this first quarter, we had a larger number of units that we capital -- are not capitalized, but are held as investments on our balance sheet, which will be syndicated in future periods, which will then become deliveries, right. So that will offset the wrapping up of rail production at Gunderson.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Lorie, [Multiple Speakers] back to your last point, those cars on balance sheet. I know that you guys mentioned the syndication obviously be beneficial. But is there a way to estimate or how you're thinking about what you're going to hold on in your only weeks I imagine that impacts the margin -- or the profitability as we're thinking through the year? Just any thoughts there.\nLorie Leeson: Well, I'll get Brian to talk to that because he's working really closely as we evaluate kind of which pieces of equipment we hold on to and which we syndicate.\nBrian Comstock: Yeah, Allison, what we're -- our stated goal, just to maybe restate it is to hold about 2,000 cars a year on our balance sheet. I think in Q1, we originated about that many a little bit more. What we're doing now is we're going through the process of identifying which ones we want from a concentration and return perspective, and then we'll begin to move some of those into the syndication channel. So Q1 was heavy in lease product. That's one of the impacts, but that will start to get released throughout the year and our plan from a leasing perspective is, again, to keep about 2,000 cars throughout the year.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. That\u2019s helpful.\nJustin Roberts: And just from a production perspective, there are -- we will be producing cars onto the balance sheet and then moving cars off the balance sheet through syndication throughout the year. This wasn't a one-time thing. It's just more a matter of it was more heavily weighted in this one quarter.\nAllison Poliniak: Yeah. I guess I was just -- because I think it doesn't -- maybe we can talk about this offline, Justin. The impact of the cars that you're putting in your own fleet, you don't necessarily recognize the profit. So I was just thinking if there was an impact we should be thinking through as you determine what you're keeping and what you're syndicating out.\nJustin Roberts: You are exactly correct, Allison. We do eliminate that revenue and margin from the manufacturing business when they are on the balance sheet and when they go into the long-term fleet, then it's just a matter of recognizing the lease income over the period of the lease. So again, we can clean up any details offline, but yeah, you are right about that.\nLorie Leeson: And I would say, this is something that is unknown, right? As we are building equipment that we will capitalize on our balance sheet and hold long term. We absolutely acknowledge that we are foregoing the profit in the moment, but believe that having that repeatable revenue, cash flow, tax advantaged cash flow is good as a balance to our strong manufacturing operation.\nAllison Poliniak: Certainly. And then I know, Lorie, you mentioned revenue was in line with your expectations, but it sounds like production did slip a little bit to the right because of the supply chain. Is there any way to quantify what that number was in terms of production level that you guys had that kind of maybe get pushed to the right and is probably more back half weighted here, just any thoughts?\nJustin Roberts: Sorry, you asked Lorie, but I was going to say a few like kind of $300 million to $500 million is probably slipped from the quarter from that perspective. The piece that was a little more punitive though, was the disruption and the inability to maintain consistency of production on certain lines throughout the quarter.\nLorie Leeson: Right, which impacts overhead absorption. So you just have more of that overhead falling through not being used efficiently.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. Thank you.\nJustin Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of questions on margin, given the surprise. But Lorie, you opened your comments with a look at the macro and I talk about some of the softening indicators from a top down perspective. Is that a message that we think we're kind of getting to the top of the cycle or more of the plateau type environment that you've talked about with maybe not as higher highs and lower lows of the railcar cycle, as we've known for much of the last 20 years? Can you just unpack the message here from a macro perspective and kind of your strategic views as you look out beyond a quarter or two, maybe two, three years and how you're playing the business? Thank you.\nLorie Leeson: Well, happy to know your, Bascome. Yeah, I think at least everything that we are seeing both internally and from looking at external forecasters, it certainly appears that we're going to be in more of a plateau when it comes to new railcar production. While that might disappoint some who like roller coasters, we're kind of excited that we didn't actually have the huge run-up that some other sectors did. So therefore, I don't believe we're going to have quite that accelerated downfall either. It will be more modest I think there is a lot of pent-up demand when it comes to rail freight movements. A lot of shippers have had to move their product in different ways. The railroads continue to embargo and not provide the kind of service that their customers need. So as they're able to add workforce, those of us who support the railroads and the rail freight industry, believe that, that -- those loadings are going to go up, the performance is going to improve and that will make for good demand. The thing that's difficult is, is there a particular movement or car type change that can sometimes create those spikes in demand that you -- is more behind some of those run-ups. Again, we don't -- I don't see that in my crystal ball right now. And I think that having the steady and diversified activity that we're seeing on manufacturing is good both for us, for a manufacturing -- well, maybe it's a little bit more difficult for our colleagues in manufacturing because it's a lot easier to just build one or two car types as opposed to eight different car types, but it does provide us a lot of benefits in the lease fleet that we're building to make certain that we've got good diversity, good quality customers, and it's good for our operating lessor customers and our syndication partners who are also looking for diversity in the equipment that they buy from us.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that. Can you talk a little bit about cash flow? Maybe this is one for Adrian. I know it's a little bit different now that you're investing more and more in the way that you account for your lease fleet. But do you have some thoughts on operating cash flow maybe before that lease (ph) investment -- lease sorry, lease investment this year? And if there will be a working capital releases get through some of these supply chain disruptions that have been sporadic but in material multiple times in the last few quarters? Thank you.\nAdrian Downes: Yeah. We would expect cash flow to be positive for the balance of the year on an overall basis. So a few of the major drivers, syndication activity should generate cash. And you can see we invested in putting a lot on our balance sheet in Q1. That cadence would be different to rest of the year. We would have improved operating results that will also help. And as you mentioned, we would expect to see some working capital efficiencies as we navigate these issues that we had in Q1, which are more short term. We have invested a lot compared to historical periods in working capital as we ramped up and we should start to see some efficiencies just from normal course as well as from resolving some of these sporadic issues that impacted Q1.\nBascome Majors: Thank you, both.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen.\nMatthew Elkott: Good morning. Thank you and sorry if my question has been asked as I had some connection issues on my end here. I want to go back to Gunderson. Lorie and Justin and the team, how much of the decision to close the facility has to do with maybe chronic access to labor issues even before COVID? And if that was one of the considerations, can you talk about your access to labor in the Northwest versus in other parts of the country in the Midwest and the South.\nLorie Leeson: Sure, Matt. Thank you for that. I don't think that we are unique in talking about having workforce attraction and retention issues. The Northwest is a little bit different as well. It's not a heavy industrial area. So it's a tough area to attract and retain a workforce. I will say that we do have a very solid and dedicated workforce that many of which have been with us for a very long time. So as I said in my prepared remarks, this was not a decision that we took lightly. We know that Gunderson is something that we've had for all of our existence, right? So this is tough. Our facilities in Arkansas, again, similar to other businesses struggle to attract and retain folks within a very difficult working environment. And so we're thinking about how we make adjustments to where we source folks, how we pay, what our conditions are thinking through the hours in a day that someone works or the fact that more people today want to work part time as opposed to -- sorry, that was -- I'm sure that came through in my voice. I'm old, and it's confusing for me that people have a hard time working a full day. But -- so we're looking at all the different things that we can do, the levers that we can pull to attract and retain a workforce that I think are great family wage jobs. Now I've got some worked up over workforce. I forgot what the rest of your question was.\nMatthew Elkott: I just was hoping to get some comparison between access to labor between the different regions. I mean, I think you answered that the Northwest may be a bit more challenging, I guess, than the rest of the country. But I also want to kind of ask you about what\u2019s your -- I know it's difficult to say -- to put a number of capacity -- annual capacity numbers because the cycles differ and the types of equipment produced affects that number. But after the closure of Gunderson, how much annual capacity would you say you would have in the U.S.?\nLorie Leeson: I don't -- I think as we've talked about our capacity numbers, and I don't -- Jeff will have to correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that as we've thrown out what I would a theoretic capacity for the North American market, we've probably not been for the last several years, assuming large numbers when it comes to the Portland facility just because we have been operating at a more modest rate. There was one other thing that I thought about in your -- the earlier part of your question and thinking about our decision for ceasing railcar production in Portland. Part of it is also where our customers are and where our competition is. And as we need to be able to be competitive in the broader market, cost-wise for our customers, there has been kind of this transition to the middle part of the country and south which is also very good from a logistics and transportation perspective to get our equipment to the customers that want to use it. So that also weighed into the decision that a location in the Pacific Northwest does have some difficulties as you've seen more and more freight moving to East Coast ports and the like.\nMatthew Elkott: Yeah. Makes sense. And then I know most industries are having supply chain issues, but it seems a bit more pronounced in the case of the railcar industry, Lorie. Do you -- I mean, first of all, is that the case? And second, why is that? I mean we've heard that maybe because of a more limited pool of suppliers on the component side. But are there any other factors that are specific to the railcar industry that are making the supply chain issues subside at a slower rate than maybe some other industrial areas?\nLorie Leeson: It is a little bit head scratching. I would say that it's likely because we and some of the others in the rail space have been ramping up production. So we are putting some pressure on that supply chain that they didn't have over the last two years. I think, quite honestly, in the rail freight OEM space, we've been -- overall, I'm sure that my procurement folks are going to kick me after this. But I would say compared to the rest of the country, we haven't had the big disruptions. So I think it's as we and others in the industrial space ramped up over the last four to six months. It's really putting that pressure on that supply chain to be able to be responsive.\nMatthew Elkott: Got it. And then just one final question on margins. This is taking a long-term view. All the changes that you're making, Gunderson and then the leasing. Does it change your outlook -- long-term outlook for what kind of gross margin you can get?\nLorie Leeson: I think these are all steps that we need to take on the journey to having solid double-digit low -- in the teens, margins on a regular basis is to look through our organization and determine where we can strain more efficiencies and costs for the business to generate that sort of return. So from my perspective, I and the leadership team, we look across the organization, and we're identifying the areas where we can start to take some action, and we're taking that action. Some of it is going to take a little bit of time. But we'll do our best to be transparent with you and our shareholders about how we're -- what -- the steps that we're taking, but it's all towards that longer-term goal of having those steady margins. And I would say, truly higher highs and higher lows. So having the lease fleet will help, I believe, to take some of the trough out of the low cycles when it comes to railcar manufacturing. Potentially, we have a couple of years here of some steady demand on that side of the business, which will allow us to really look through the operations and see where we can continue to optimize them.\nMatthew Elkott: Great. Thank you, Lorie. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nBrian Comstock: Good morning, Steve.\nLorie Leeson: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Barger: Appreciate the detail on some of the actions you're taking in the near term. On the last call, you suggested earnings would have maybe a 40% first half, 60% second half weighting. As you think about it now, should we be thinking that's more 25-75, or what do you expect for an earnings cadence for the year?\nAdrian Downes: I think that's more realistic given the performance in Q1.\nSteve Barger: The 25-75?\nAdrian Downes: Yes.\nSteve Barger: Okay. And Lorie, you've had to deal with some tough operational conditions for a while. You're obviously taking actions to address that. For 2023, what is -- can you just talk about your priority list? Is it really fixing gross margin first? Is it driving syndication activity or market share? And then second part to that question, maybe you answered this to some degree. But longer term, what do you see as the key to driving shareholder value creation? What's that message that you're pushing to the team?\nLorie Leeson: We're trying to steal our thunder from April, Steve. You all make secrets right now. I think -- I would say, yes, my number one focus is improving our gross margins getting to that steady margin that I know that we can do. And then we will look to how we're optimizing the services side of our business, which -- the biggest piece of that is leasing and figuring out how we do that at a modest pace, balancing it with our customer needs for -- on the syndication side and the operating lessor side, this is something that Greenbrier has done for years. We have been able to manage relationships with a wide variety of customers and do this in a way that I think can be beneficial for our shareholders as well as for our customers. So it's not going to be a revolution. It's going to be an evolution of how we're going to continue to build off of the foundation. Looking at some of the investments that we've made over time are where we have value tied up on the balance sheet and how we can either get that -- those investments on our balance sheet to generate better returns or to offload them and focus on the things that are our priorities.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks. And I'm sure you'll talk more in April about all that. In terms -- for the near term on the gross margin, what is the biggest bucket of value creation or margin expansion? Is it optimizing the manufacturing or the internal fabrication capacity? Is it just footprint? How much does mix play into that? Like what levers are you pulling first to drive that near-term outcome?\nLorie Leeson: I think definitely, it is the supply chain and in-sourcing some of those vital components that we need to make certain that we are managing those costs. Bill Krueger, who is now running our manufacturing operation has been working closely with the teams on the ground to really think through if we have certain capacity within our operations, are we utilizing our capacity to its highest potential and for the most vital components? And really thinking through that a lot more strategically, particularly as we're building a broader range of products that requires a broader ability to provide those subcomponents.\nSteve Barger: Do you think you have the manufacturing capacity, the process equipment that you need or would this require investment in machinery to be able to in-source some of that?\nLorie Leeson: It will take some modest investments, but that's part of what's in our guidance right now.\nSteve Barger: That's in the CapEx right now. Okay. All right. Thanks.\nLorie Leeson: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Justin Roberts for any closing remarks.\nJustin Roberts: Thank you very much for your time and attention today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to us at investorrelations@gbrx.com. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
